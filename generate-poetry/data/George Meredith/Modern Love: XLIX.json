    "He found her by the ocean\u2019s moaning verge,",
    "Nor any wicked change in her discerned;",
    "And she believed his old love had returned,",
    "Which was her exultation, and her scourge.",
    "She took his hand, and walked with him, and seemed",
    "The wife he sought, though shadow-like and dry.",
    "She had one terror, lest her heart should sigh,",
    "And tell her loudly that she no longer dreamed.",
    "She dared not say, \u2018This is my breast: look in.\u2019",
    "But there\u2019s a strength to help the desperate weak.",
    "That night he learned how silence best can speak",
    "The awful things when Pity pleads for Sin.",
    "About the middle of the night her call",
    "Was heard, and he came wondering to the bed.",
    "\u2018Now kiss me, dear! it may be, now!\u2019 she said.",
    "Lethe had passed those lips, and he knew all."

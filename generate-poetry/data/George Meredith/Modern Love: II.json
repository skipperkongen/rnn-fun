    "It ended, and the morrow brought the task.",
    "Her eyes were guilty gates, that let him in",
    "By shutting all too zealous for their sin:",
    "Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask.",
    "But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had!",
    "He sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:",
    "A languid humour stole among the hours,",
    "And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,",
    "And raged deep inward, till the light was brown",
    "Before his vision, and the world, forgot,",
    "Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.",
    "A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown",
    "The pit of infamy: and then again",
    "He fainted on his vengefulness, and strove",
    "To ape the magnanimity of love,",
    "And smote himself, a shuddering heap of pain."

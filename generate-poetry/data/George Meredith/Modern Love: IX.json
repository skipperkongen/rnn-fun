    "He felt the wild beast in him betweenwhiles",
    "So masterfully rude, that he would grieve",
    "To see the helpless delicate thing receive",
    "His guardianship through certain dark defiles.",
    "Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?",
    "But still he spared her. Once: \u2018Have you no fear?\u2019",
    "He said: \u2019twas dusk; she in his grasp; none near.",
    "She laughed: \u2018No, surely; am I not with you?\u2019",
    "And uttering that soft starry \u2018you,\u2019 she leaned",
    "Her gentle body near him, looking up;",
    "And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,",
    "He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.",
    "Devilish malignant witch! and oh, young beam",
    "Of heaven\u2019s circle-glory! Here they shape",
    "To squeeze like an intoxicating grape \u2013",
    "I might, and yet thou goest safe, supreme."

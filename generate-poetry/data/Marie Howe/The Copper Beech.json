    "Immense, entirely itself,",
    "it wore that yard like a dress,",
    "with limbs low enough for me to enter it",
    "and climb the crooked ladder to where",
    "I could lean against the trunk and practice being alone.",
    "One day, I heard the sound before I saw it, rain fell",
    "darkening the sidewalk.",
    "Sitting close to the center, not very high in the branches,",
    "I heard it hitting the high leaves, and I was happy,",
    "watching it happen without it happening to me."

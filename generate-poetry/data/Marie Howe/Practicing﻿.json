    "I want to write a love poem for the girls I kissed in seventh grade,",
    "a song for what we did on the floor in the basement",
    "of somebody\u2019s parents\u2019 house, a hymn for what we didn\u2019t say but thought:",
    "or",
    "when we learned how to open each other\u2019s mouths",
    "how to move our tongues to make somebody moan. We called it practicing, and",
    "one was the boy, and we paired off\u2014maybe six or eight girls\u2014and turned out",
    "the lights and kissed and kissed until we were stoned on kisses, and lifted our",
    "nightgowns or let the straps drop, and, Now you be the boy:",
    "concrete floor, sleeping bag or couch, playroom, game room, train room, laundry.",
    "Linda\u2019s basement was like a boat with booths and portholes",
    "instead of windows. Gloria\u2019s father had a bar downstairs with stools that spun,",
    "plush carpeting. We kissed each other\u2019s throats.",
    "We sucked each other\u2019s breasts, and we left marks, and never spoke of it upstairs",
    "outdoors, in daylight, not once. We did it, and it was",
    "practicing, and slept, sprawled so our legs still locked or crossed, a hand still lost",
    "in someone\u2019s hair . . . and we grew up and hardly mentioned who",
    "the first kiss really was\u2014a girl like us, still sticky with moisturizer we\u2019d",
    "shared in the bathroom. I want to write a song",
    "for that thick silence in the dark, and the first pure thrill of unreluctant desire,",
    "just before we\u2019d made ourselves stop."

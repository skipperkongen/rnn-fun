    "Evening! as slow thy placid shades descend,",
    "Veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still,",
    "The lonely battlement, the farthest hill",
    "And wood, I think of those who have no friend;",
    "Who now, perhaps, by melancholy led,",
    "From the broad blaze of day, where pleasure flaunts,",
    "Retiring, wander to the ring-dove\u2019s haunts",
    "Unseen; and watch the tints that o\u2019er thy bed",
    "Hang lovely; oft to musing Fancy\u2019s eye",
    "Presenting fairy vales, where the tir\u2019d mind",
    "Might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind,",
    "Nor hear the hourly moans of misery!",
    "Alas for man! that Hope\u2019s fair views the while",
    "Should smile like you, and perish as they smile!"

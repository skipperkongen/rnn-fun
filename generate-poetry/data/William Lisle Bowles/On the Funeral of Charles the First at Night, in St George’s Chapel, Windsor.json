    "The castle clock had tolled midnight:",
    "With mattock and with spade,",
    "And silent, by the torches\u2019 light,",
    "His corse in earth we laid.",
    "The coffin bore his name, that those",
    "Of other years might know,",
    "When earth its secrets should disclose,",
    "Whose bones were laid below.",
    "\u201cPeace to the dead\u201d no children sung,",
    "Slow pacing up the nave,\u2014",
    "No prayers were read, no knell was rung,",
    "As deep we dug his grave.",
    "We only heard the winter's wind,",
    "In many a sullen gust,",
    "As, o\u2019er the open grave inclined,",
    "We murmured, \u201cDust to dust!\u201d",
    "A moonbeam from the arch\u2019s height",
    "Streamed, as we placed the stone;",
    "The long aisles started into light,",
    "And all the windows shone.",
    "We thought we saw the banners then,",
    "That shook along the walls,",
    "Whilst the sad shades of mail\u00e8d men",
    "Were gazing on the stalls.",
    "\u2019Tis gone! again on tombs defaced",
    "Sits darkness more profound;",
    "And only by the torch we traced",
    "The shadows on the ground.",
    "And now the chilling, freezing air",
    "Without blew long and loud;",
    "Upon our knees we breathed one prayer,",
    "Where he slept in his shroud.",
    "We laid the broken marble floor,\u2014",
    "No name, no trace appears,\u2014",
    "And when we closed the sounding door,",
    "We thought of him with tears."

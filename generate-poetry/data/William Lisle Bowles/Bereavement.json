    "Whose was that gentle voice, that, whispering sweet,",
    "Promised methought long days of bliss sincere!",
    "Soothing it stole on my deluded ear,",
    "Most like soft music, that might sometimes cheat",
    "Thoughts dark and drooping! \u2019Twas the voice of Hope.",
    "Of love and social scenes, it seemed to speak,",
    "Of truth, of friendship, of affection meek;",
    "That, oh! poor friend, might to life\u2019s downward slope",
    "Lead us in peace, and bless our latest hours.",
    "Ah me! the prospect saddened as she sung;",
    "Loud on my startled ear the death-bell rung;",
    "Chill darkness wrapt the pleasurable bowers,",
    "Whilst Horror, pointing to yon breathless clay,",
    "\u201cNo peace be thine,\u201d exclaimed, \u201caway, away!\u201d"

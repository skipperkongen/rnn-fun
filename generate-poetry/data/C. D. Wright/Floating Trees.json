    "a bed is left open to a mirror",
    "a mirror gazes long and hard at a bed",
    "light fingers the house with its own acoustics",

    "one has paper",
    "bed of swollen creeks and theories and coils",
    "bed of eyes and leaky pens",
    "much of the night the air touches arms",
    "arms extend themselves to air",
    "their torsos turning toward a roll",
    "of sound: thunder",
    "night of coon scat and vandalized headstones",
    "night of deep kisses and catamenia",
    "his face by this light: saurian",
    "hers: ash like the tissue of a hornets\u2019 nest",
    "one scans the aisle of firs",
    "the faint blue line of them",
    "one looks out: sans serif",
    "\u201cDidn\u2019t I hear you tell them you were born",
    "on a train\u201d",
    "what begins with a sough and ends with a groan",
    "groan in which the tongue\u2019s true color is revealed",
    "the comb\u2019s sough and the denim\u2019s undeniable rub",
    "the chair\u2019s stripped back and muddied rung",
    "color of stone soup and garden gloves",
    "color of meal and treacle and sphagnum",
    "hangers clinging to their coat",
    "a soft white bulb to its string",
    "the footprints inside us",
    "iterate the footprints outside",
    "the scratched words return to their sleeves",
    "the dresses of monday through friday",
    "swallow the long hips of weekends",

    "ink of eyes and veins and phonemes",
    "the ink completes the feeling",
    "a mirror silently facing a door",
    "door with no lock no lock",
    "the room he brings into you",
    "the room befalls you",
    "like the fir trees he trues her",
    "she nears him like the firs",
    "if one vanishes one stays",
    "if one stays the other will or will not vanish",
    "otherwise my beautiful green fly",
    "otherwise not a leaf stirs"

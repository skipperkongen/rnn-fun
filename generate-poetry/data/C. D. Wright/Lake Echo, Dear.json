    "Is the woman in the pool of light",
    "really reading or just staring",
    "at what is written",
    "Is the man walking in the soft rain",
    "naked or is it the rain",
    "that makes his shirt transparent",
    "The boy in the iron cot",
    "is he asleep or still",
    "fingering the springs underneath",
    "Did you honestly believe",
    "three lives could be complete",
    "The bottle of green liquid",
    "on the sill is it real",
    "The bottle on the peeling sill",
    "is it filled with green",
    "Or is the liquid an illusion",
    "of fullness",
    "How summer\u2019s children turn",
    "into fish and rain softens men",
    "How the elements of summer",
    "nights bid us to get down with each other",
    "on the unplaned floor",
    "And this feels painfully beautiful",
    "whether or not",
    "it will change the world one drop"

    "In one corner of the ward",
    "somebody was eating a raw chicken.",
    "The cheerful nurses did not see.",
    "With the tube down my throat",
    "I could not tell them.",
    "Nor did they notice the horror show",
    "on the TV set suspended over my windowless bed.",
    "The screen was dead",
    "but a torn face was clear.",
    "I did not see my own",
    "in a mirror for weeks.",
    "When it happened,",
    "when I dared to face my face",
    "after the ravaging,",
    "it was not mine",
    "but something whittled, honed down",
    "to a sly resemblance.",
    "It, even the mirror, the pale room,",
    "the oxygen tank",
    "neat and black as a bomb",
    "in its portable crate\u2014",
    "all was hallucination.",
    "But the bloody rooster,",
    "the stray pieces of bodies",
    "slung into dreamless nooks,",
    "the white-haired doll whimpering",
    "on a gift counter\u2014",
    "those were real.",
    "I keep living there.",
    "Foolish. I am home. Half safe."

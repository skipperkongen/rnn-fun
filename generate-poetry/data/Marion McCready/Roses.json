    "There is no escaping the storm of roses",
    "crisscrossed on the split-cracked wall",
    "of a dead fountain arch.",
    "There is no escaping their uterine balls,",
    "expanding as a reminder of the children I never had.",
    "If you listen carefully you can hear the vibrations,",
    "the heart drone of their petal jaw-harps.",
    "And there\u2019s no going back,",
    "no indiscovery of Mars",
    "or these red planets brooding before me,",
    "light predators, sun-hatched",
    "and bloodening like the fists of women",
    "who have gone to war."

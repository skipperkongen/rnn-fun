    "I watch the woods for deer as if I\u2019m armed.",
    "I watch the woods for deer who never come.",
    "I know the hes and shes in autumn",
    "rendezvous in orchards stained with fallen",
    "apples\u2019 scent. I drive my car this way to work",
    "so I may let the crows in corn believe",
    "it\u2019s me their caws are meant to warn,",
    "and snakes who turn in warm and secret caves",
    "they know me too. They know the boy",
    "who lives inside me still won\u2019t go away.",
    "The deer are ghosts who slip between the light",
    "through trees, so you may only hear the snap",
    "of branches in the thicket beyond hope.",
    "I watch the woods for deer, as if I\u2019m armed."

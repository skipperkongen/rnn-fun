    "Because this evening Miss Hoang Yen",
    "sat down with me in the small",
    "tiled room of her family house",
    "I am unable to sleep.",
    "We shared a glass of cold and sweet water.",
    "On a blue plate her mother brought us",
    "cake and smiled her betel-black teeth at me",
    "but I did not feel strange in the house",
    "my country had tried to bomb into dust.",
    "In English thick and dazed as blood",
    "she told me how she watched our planes",
    "cross her childhood\u2019s sky,",
    "all the children of Hanoi",
    "carried in darkness to mountain hamlets, Nixon\u2019s",
    "Christmas bombing. She let me hold her hand,",
    "her shy unmoving fingers, and told me",
    "how afraid she was those days and how this fear",
    "had dug inside her like a worm and lives",
    "inside her still, won\u2019t die or go away.",
    "And because she\u2019s stronger, she comforted me,",
    "said I\u2019m not to blame,",
    "the million sorrows alive in her gaze.",
    "With the dead we share no common rooms.",
    "With the frightened we can\u2019t think straight;",
    "no words can bring the burning city back.",
    "Outside on Hung Dao Street",
    "I tried to say good-bye and held her hand",
    "too long so she looked back through traffic",
    "towards her house and with her eyes",
    "she told me I should leave.",
    "All night I ached for her and for myself",
    "and nothing I could think or pray",
    "would make it stop. Some birds sang morning",
    "home across the lake. In small reed boats",
    "the lotus gatherers sailed out",
    "among their resuming white blossoms."

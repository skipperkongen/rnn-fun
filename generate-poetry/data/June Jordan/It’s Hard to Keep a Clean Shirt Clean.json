    "It\u2019s a sunlit morning",
    "with jasmine blooming",
    "easily",
    "and a drove of robin redbreasts",
    "diving into the ivy covering",
    "what used to be",
    "a backyard fence",
    "or doves shoving aside",
    "the birch tree leaves",
    "when",
    "a young man walks among",
    "the flowers",
    "to my doorway",
    "where he knocks",
    "then stands still",
    "brilliant in a clean white shirt",
    "He lifts a soft fist",
    "to that door",
    "and knocks again",
    "He\u2019s come to say this",
    "was or that",
    "was",
    "not",
    "and what\u2019s",
    "anyone of us to do",
    "about what\u2019s done",
    "what\u2019s past",
    "but prickling salt to sting",
    "our eyes",
    "What\u2019s anyone of us to do",
    "about what\u2019s done",
    "And 7-month-old Bingo",
    "puppy leaps",
    "and hits",
    "that clean white shirt",
    "with muddy paw",
    "prints here",
    "and here and there",
    "And what\u2019s anyone of us to do",
    "about what\u2019s done",
    "I say I\u2019ll wash the shirt",
    "no problem",
    "two times through",
    "the delicate blue cycle",
    "of an old machine",
    "the shirt spins in the soapy",
    "suds and spins in rinse",
    "and spins",
    "and spins out dry",
    "not clean",
    "still marked by accidents",
    "by energy of whatever serious or trifling cause",
    "the shirt stays dirty",
    "from that puppy\u2019s paws",
    "I take that fine white shirt",
    "from India",
    "the threads as soft as baby",
    "fingers weaving them",
    "together",
    "and I wash that shirt",
    "between",
    "between the knuckles of my own",
    "two hands",
    "I scrub and rub that shirt",
    "to take the dirty",
    "markings",
    "out",
    "At the pocket",
    "and around the shoulder seam",
    "and on both sleeves",
    "the dirt the paw",
    "prints tantalize my soap",
    "my water my sweat",
    "equity",
    "invested in the restoration",
    "of a clean white shirt",
    "And on the eleventh try",
    "I see no more",
    "no anything unfortunate",
    "no dirt",
    "I hold the limp fine",
    "cloth",
    "between the faucet stream",
    "of water as transparent",
    "as a wish the moon stayed out",
    "all day",
    "How small it has become!",
    "That clean white shirt!",
    "How delicate!",
    "How slight!",
    "How like a soft fist knocking on my door!",
    "And now I hang the shirt",
    "to dry",
    "as slowly as it needs",
    "the air",
    "to work its way",
    "with everything",
    "It\u2019s clean.",
    "A clean white shirt",
    "nobody wanted to spoil",
    "or soil",
    "that shirt",
    "much cleaner now but also",
    "not the same",
    "as the first before that shirt",
    "got hit got hurt",
    "not perfect",
    "anymore",
    "just beautiful",
    "a clean white shirt",
    "It\u2019s hard to keep a clean shirt clean."

    "When the living rot on the bodies of the dead",

    "When clergymen pick up the hammer and crucify",
    "When officials open the door to the enemy",
    "When the mountain peoples\u2019 feet weigh like elephants",
    "When roses grow only in cemeteries",
    "When they eat the Palestinian\u2019s liver before he\u2019s even dead",
    "When the sun itself has no other purpose than being a shroud",
    "the human tide moves on . . ."

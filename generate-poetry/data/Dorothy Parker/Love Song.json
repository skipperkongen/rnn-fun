    "My own dear love, he is strong and bold",
    "And he cares not what comes after.",
    "His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,",
    "And his eyes are lit with laughter.",
    "He is jubilant as a flag unfurled\u2014",
    "Oh, a girl, she\u2019d not forget him.",
    "My own dear love, he is all my world,\u2014",
    "And I wish I\u2019d never met him.",
    "My love, he\u2019s mad, and my love, he\u2019s fleet,",
    "And a wild young wood-thing bore him!",
    "The ways are fair to his roaming feet,",
    "And the skies are sunlit for him.",
    "As sharply sweet to my heart he seems",
    "As the fragrance of acacia.",
    "My own dear love, he is all my dreams,\u2014",
    "And I wish he were in Asia.",
    "My love runs by like a day in June,",
    "And he makes no friends of sorrows.",
    "He\u2019ll tread his galloping rigadoon",
    "In the pathway of the morrows.",
    "He\u2019ll live his days where the sunbeams start,",
    "Nor could storm or wind uproot him.",
    "My own dear love, he is all my heart,\u2014",
    "And I wish somebody\u2019d shoot him."

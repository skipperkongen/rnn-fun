    "This stream took a shorter course\u2014",
    "a thread of water that makes oasis",
    "out of mud, in pooling,",
    "does not aspire to lake. To river, leave",
    "the forest, the clamorous wild.",
    "I cannot. Wherever I am,",
    "I am here, nonsensical, rhapsodic,",
    "stock-still as the trees. Trickling",
    "never floods, furrows its meager path",
    "through the forest floor.",
    "There will always be a root",
    "too thirsty, moss that only swallows",
    "and spreads. Primordial home, I am dying",
    "from love of you. Were I tuber or quillwort,",
    "the last layer of leaves that starts the dirt",
    "or the meekest pond,",
    "I would absorb everything.",
    "I would drown. Water makes song",
    "of erratic forms, and I hear the living",
    "push back branches, wander off trail."

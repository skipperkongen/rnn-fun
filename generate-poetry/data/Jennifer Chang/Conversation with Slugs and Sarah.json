    "touch the topic of slime\u2014and those eyes",
    "dangling from tentacle tips must be a",

    "Slug sublimity suggests love\u2019s a drag,",

    "memory and... What did we do before",
    "YouTube? Boob tube. Boobs we have none; slugs,",
    "of course, don\u2019t care, can\u2019t tell girl from boy,",

    "love and love be lust? you\u2019re always asking,",
    "even now as the slugs begin their sluggish",
    "withdrawal\u2014each complete in love and lust;",
    "each mother and father to what they\u2019ve made",
    "together; each alone, content, and free."

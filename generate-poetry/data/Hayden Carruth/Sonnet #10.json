    "You rose from our embrace and the small light spread",
    "like an aureole around you. The long parabola",
    "of neck and shoulder, flank and thigh I saw",
    "permute itself through unfolding and unlimited",
    "minuteness in the movement of your tall tread,",
    "the spine-root swaying, the Picasso-like \u00e9clat",
    "of scissoring slender legs. I knew some law",
    "of Being was at work. At one time I had said",
    "that love bestows such values, and so it does,",
    "but the old man in his canto was right and wise:",
    "Always I wanted to give and in wanting was",
    "the poet. A man now, aging, I know the best",
    "of love is not to bestow, but to recognize."

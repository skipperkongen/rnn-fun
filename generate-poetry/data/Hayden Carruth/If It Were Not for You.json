    "Liebe, meine liebe, I had not hoped",
    "to be so poor",
    "The night winds reach",
    "like the blind breath of the world",
    "in a rhythm without mind, gusting and beating",
    "as if to destroy us, battering our poverty",
    "and all the land\u2019s flat and cold and dark",
    "under iron snow",
    "the dog leaps in the wind",
    "barking, maddened with winter, and his voice",
    "claps again and again down the valley",
    "like tatters of revolutionary pennants",
    "birches",
    "cry and hemlocks by the brook",
    "stand hunched and downcast with their hands",
    "in their pockets",
    "Liebe, the world is wild",
    "and without intention",
    "how far",
    "this might be from the night of Christmas",
    "if it were not for you.",
    "Down the reaching wind",
    "shrieks of starlight bear broken messages",
    "among mountains where shadows plunge",
    "yet our brightness",
    "is unwavering",
    "wo die zitronen bl\u00fchn, im dunkeln laub",
    "die goldorangen ... liebe",
    "art thou singing",
    "It is a question partly",
    "of the tree with our stars and partly",
    "of your radiance brought from the land",
    "where legends flower to this land",
    "but more than these our bright poverty",
    "is a house in the wind and a light",
    "on the mountain",
    "Liebe, our light rekindled",
    "in this remoteness from the other land,",
    "in this dark of the blue mountain where only",
    "the winds gather",
    "is what we are for the time that we are",
    "what we know for the time that we know",
    "How gravely and sweetly the poor touch in the dark."

    "The northern lights. I wouldn\u2019t have noticed them",
    "if the deer hadn\u2019t told me",
    "a doe her coat of pearls her glowing hoofs",
    "proud and inquisitive",
    "eager for my appraisal",
    "and I went out into the night with electrical steps",
    "but with my head held also proud",
    "to share the animal\u2019s fear",
    "and see what I had seen before",
    "a sky flaring and spectral",
    "greenish waves and ribbons",
    "and the snow under strange light tossing in the pasture",
    "like a storming ocean caught",
    "by a flaring beacon.",
    "The deer stands away from me not far",
    "there among bare black apple trees",
    "a presence I no longer see.",
    "We are proud to be afraid",
    "proud to share",
    "the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars",
    "and flickers around our heads",
    "like the saints\u2019 cold spiritual agonies",
    "of old.",
    "I remember but without the sense other light-storms",
    "cold memories discursive and philosophical",
    "in my mind\u2019s burden",
    "and the deer remembers nothing.",
    "We move our feet crunching bitter snow while the storm",
    "crashes like god-wars down the east",
    "we shake the sparks from our eyes",
    "we quiver inside our shocked fur",
    "we search for each other",
    "in the apple thicket\u2014",
    "a glimpse, an acknowledgment",
    "it is enough and never enough\u2014",
    "we toss our heads and say good night",
    "moving away on bitter bitter snow."

    "The little pitiful, worn, laughing faces,",
    "Begging of Life for Joy!",
    "I saw the little daughters of the poor,",
    "Tense from the long day's working, strident, gay,",
    "Hurrying to the picture-place. There curled",
    "A hideous flushed beggar at the door,",
    "Trading upon his horror, eyeless, maimed,",
    "Complacent in his profitable mask.",
    "They mocked his horror, but they gave to him",
    "From the brief wealth of pay-night, and went in",
    "To the cheap laughter and the tawdry thoughts",
    "Thrown on the screen; in to the seeking hand",
    "Covered by darkness, to the luring voice",
    "Of Horror, boy-masked, whispering of rings,",
    "Of silks, of feathers, bought\u2014so cheap!\u2014with just",
    "Their slender starved child-bodies, palpitant",
    "For Beauty, Laughter, Passion, that is Life:",
    "(A frock of satin for an hour's shame,",
    "A coat of fur for two days' servitude;",
    "\u201cAnd the clothes last,\u201d the thought runs on, within",
    "The poor warped girl-minds drugged with changeless days;",
    "\u201cWho cares or knows after the hour is done?\u201d)",
    "\u2014Poor little beggars at Life's door for Joy!",
    "The old man crouched there, eyeless, horrible,",
    "Complacent in the marketable mask",
    "That earned his comforts\u2014and they gave to him!",
    "But ah, the little painted, wistful faces",
    "Questioning Life for Joy!"

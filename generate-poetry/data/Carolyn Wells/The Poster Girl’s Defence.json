    "It was an Artless Poster Girl pinned up against my wall,",
    "She was tremendous ugly, she was exceeding tall;",
    "I was gazing at her idly, and I think I must have slept,",
    "For that poster maiden lifted up her poster voice, and wept.",
    "She said between her poster sobs, \u2018I think it\u2019s rather rough",
    "To be jeered and fleered and flouted, and I\u2019ve stood it long enough;",
    "I\u2019m tired of being quoted as a Fright and Fad and Freak,",
    "And I take this opportunity my poster mind to speak.",
    "\u2018Although my hair is carmine and my nose is edged with blue,",
    "Although my style is splashy and my shade effects are few,",
    "Although I\u2019m out of drawing and my back hair is a show,",
    "Yet I have n\u2019t half the whimseys of the maidens that you know.",
    "\u2018I never keep you waiting while I prink before the glass,",
    "I never talk such twaddle as that little Dawson lass,",
    "I never paint on china, nor erotic novels write,",
    "And I never have recited \u201cCurfew must not ring tonight\u201d.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t rave over Ibsen, I never, never flirt,",
    "I never wear a shirt waist with a disconnected skirt;",
    "I never speak in public on \u201cThe Suffrage\u201d, or \u201cThe Race\u201d,",
    "I never talk while playing whist, or trump my partner\u2019s ace.\u2019",
    "I said: \u2018O artless Poster Girl, you\u2019re in the right of it,",
    "You are a joy forever, though a thing of beauty, nit!\u2019",
    "And from her madder eyebrows to her utmost purple swirl,",
    "Against all captious critics I\u2019ll defend the Poster Girl."

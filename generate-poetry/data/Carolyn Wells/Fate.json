    "Two shall be born the whole world wide apart,",
    "And speak in different tongues, and pay their debts",
    "In different kinds of coin; and give no heed",
    "Each to the other\u2019s being. And know not",
    "That each might suit the other to a T,",
    "If they were but correctly introduced.",
    "And these, unconsciously, shall bend their steps,",
    "Escaping Spaniards and defying war,",
    "Unerringly toward the same trysting-place,",
    "Albeit they know it not. Until at last",
    "They enter the same door, and suddenly",
    "They meet. And ere they\u2019ve seen each other\u2019s face",
    "They fall into each other\u2019s arms, upon",
    "The Broadway cable car \u2013 and this is Fate!"

    "Ye rosy-armed, pure Graces, come,",
    "Daughters of Zeus, be near!",
    "Oh, wherefore have my lips been dumb",
    "So long in silence drear?",
    "And why have I so cheerless been,",
    "So sorrowful and wild?",
    "It was because ye were not seen,",
    "Because ye had not smiled.",
    "Although his prayer the Muses bless,",
    "The poet doth require",
    "That ye, in frolic gentleness,",
    "Should stand beside his lyre.",
    "Ne\u2019er will he mortal ear delight,",
    "Nor care-vex\u2019d spirit ease;",
    "Except he sing with ye in sight,",
    "Rose-flushed among the trees."

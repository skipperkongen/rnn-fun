    "Though I sing high, and chaunt above her,",
    "Praising my girl,",
    "It were not right",
    "To reckon her the poorer lover;",
    "She does not love me less",
    "For her royal, jewelled speechlessness,",
    "She is the sapphire, she the light,",
    "The music in the pearl.",
    "Not from pert birds we learn the spring-tide",
    "From open sky.",
    "What speaks to us",
    "Closer than far distances that hide",
    "In woods, what is more dear",
    "Than a cherry-bough, bees feeding near",
    "In the soft, proffered blooms? Lo, I",
    "Am fed and honoured thus.",
    "She has the star\u2019s own pulse; its throbbing",
    "Is a quick light.",
    "She is a dove",
    "My soul draws to its breast; her sobbing",
    "Is for the warm dark there!",
    "In the heat of her wings I would not care",
    "My close-housed bird should take her flight",
    "To magnify our love."

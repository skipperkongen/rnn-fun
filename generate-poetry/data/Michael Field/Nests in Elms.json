    "The rooks are cawing up and down the trees!",
    "Among their nests they caw. O sound I treasure,",
    "Ripe as old music is, the summer's measure,",
    "Sleep at her gossip, sylvan mysteries,",
    "With prate and clamour to give zest of these\u2014",
    "In rune I trace the ancient law of pleasure,",
    "Of love, of all the busy-ness of leisure,",
    "With dream on dream of never-thwarted ease.",
    "O homely birds, whose cry is harbinger",
    "Of nothing sad, who know not anything",
    "Of sea-birds' loneliness, of Procne's strife,",
    "Rock round me when I die! So sweet it were",
    "To die by open doors, with you on wing",
    "Humming the deep security of life."

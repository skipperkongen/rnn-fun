    "You may hear that your heartbeat is uneven",
    "and let new tension climb around your shoulders,",
    "thinking you've found the trick for going mad.",
    "But try to keep a grip on where you are.",
    "Remember: all around you is pure city;",
    "try to stay alert. On the wide streets,",
    "so empty late at night, streaking in glass,",
    "the color of an alley, or the fall",
    "of a sideways flicker from a neon sign",
    "may utterly and briefly disconcert you\u2014",
    "but as you go, you'll find that noise is worse.",
    "Prepare for noise. But never scream. Even tensing",
    "ears too far in advance can sharpen sirens,",
    "and as for horns. ... When you're back to",
    "your normal rhythm after such encounters,",
    "just try to stay alert. You'll never know",
    "exactly who is coming up behind you,",
    "but the sudden movement of pedestrians",
    "will finally, of course, be what disarms you."

    "My mind hovered over my baby, like",
    "a raptor, and froze everything it saw.",
    "I looked through my own pregnant belly's raw",
    "perimeters and found his heart to strike",
    "attentive until, helpless with the pound",
    "of still more blood, he seemed to settle down.",
    "It was my loss to feel like god alone",
    "for a new one always listening, to reach",
    "inside for his ears to share the flying speech",
    "I heard so constantly. Within my grown",
    "silence, my sounding, my loud body where",
    "the baby turned, my mind learned not to care",
    "whether thoughts I felt he noticed with no fear",
    "were mine alone\u2014or whether he could hear."

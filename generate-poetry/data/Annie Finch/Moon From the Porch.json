    "Moon has dusks for walls,",
    "October\u2019s days for a floor,",
    "crickets for rooms, windy halls.",
    "Only one night is her door.",
    "When I was thirteen she found me,",
    "spiralled into my blood like a hive.",
    "I stood on a porch where she wound me",
    "for the first time, tight and alive,",
    "till my body flooded to find her:",
    "to know I would not be alone",
    "as I moved through the tides that don't bind her",
    "into womanhood, like a flung stone.",
    "With each curve that waxed into fullness",
    "I grew to her, ready and wild.",
    "I filled myself up like her priestess.",
    "I emptied myself like her child.",
    "Flooding, ready, and certain,",
    "I hid her\u2014full, fallow, or frail\u2014",
    "beneath each long summer's rich curtain.",
    "It covered her face\u2014the thin grail",
    "that delivers me now. Now I\u2019m with her.",
    "All cast shadows come home.",
    "I stand in these shadows to kiss her;",
    "I spin in her cool, calming storm.",
    "and my shadow grows deeper than blood,",
    "oh triple, oh goddess, sustain me",
    "with your light\u2019s simple opening hood."

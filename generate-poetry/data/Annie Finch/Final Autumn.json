    "Maple leaves turn black in the courtyard.",
    "Light drives lower and one bluejay crams",
    "our cold memories out past the sun,",
    "each time your traces come past the shadows",
    "and visit under my looking-glass fingers",
    "that lift and block out the sun.",
    "Come\u2014I\u2019ll trace you one final autumn,",
    "and you can trace your last homecoming",
    "into the snow or the sun."

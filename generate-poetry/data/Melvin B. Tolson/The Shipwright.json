    "Down in the shipyard, day and night,",

    "Day and night",
    "The diapason puts",
    "The bent-winged gulls to flight",
    "And shakes the harbor and quakes the ground",
    "And leaps at the suns like Prometheus bound.",
    "Our matrix shapes our citizen of the world",
    "To cross the churning mountains of the sea,",
    "Nor fashions a canoe to sail a lake",
    "In cool felicity."

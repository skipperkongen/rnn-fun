    "The night\u2019s turned everything to junipers",
    "shagged & spooked with cerulean chalk-fruit,",
    "weird berries whiffing of Martians in rut.",
    "I forget this isn\u2019t my universe",
    "sometimes. Sometimes I think I was falling",
    "most of my life to land here, a lone skirl",
    "in the immaculate hush. In my world",
    "I waltzed with my ink-self, my black shantung.",
    "Owls swallow vowels in stilled trees. It\u2019s not",
    "sleeplessness, it\u2019s fear of what the dark will",
    "do if I don\u2019t keep a close eye on it.",
    "Blue minutes leak from the pricked stars\u2019 prisms,",
    "seep into the earth unchecked. Just as well\u2014",
    "I\u2019ve hardly enough arms to gather them."

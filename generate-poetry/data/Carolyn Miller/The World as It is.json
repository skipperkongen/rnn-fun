    "No ladders, no descending angels, no voice",
    "out of the whirlwind, no rending",
    "of the veil, or chariot in the sky\u2014only",
    "water rising and falling in breathing springs",
    "and seeping up through limestone, aquifers filling",
    "and flowing over, russet stands of prairie grass",
    "and dark pupils of black-eyed Susans. Only",
    "the fixed and wandering stars: Orion rising sideways,",
    "Jupiter traversing the southwest like a great firefly,",
    "Venus trembling and faceted in the west\u2014and the moon,",
    "appearing suddenly over your shoulder, brimming",
    "and ovoid, ripe with light, lifting slowly, deliberately,",
    "wobbling slightly, while far below, the faithful sea",
    "rises up and follows."

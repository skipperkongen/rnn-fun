    "If ever the sweet spring comes,",
    "I\u2019ll put aside these dead books",
    "And try to feel the herbage freshen",
    "Along the withered boughs of old dry thoughts.",
    "I\u2019ll walk out somewhere where a garden grows,",
    "And there I\u2019ll stand some summer evening,",
    "Hat beside elbows on the gray stone wall,",
    "And the wind will stir, coming from behind the hill.",
    "Afterward I\u2019ll walk home, hands behind me,",
    "And pause a moment before going in,",
    "Half fancying some one has called my name,",
    "Or been awakened to a flutter as I passed.",
    "Of course, I\u2019ll enter, but leave the door ajar,",
    "For someone",
    "come in, you know,",
    "Expectantly I\u2019ll sit to fancy the long evening through",
    "That a pair of eyes in the summer night",
    "Might light a candle in the dull world,",
    "So softly that none might see to smile at,",
    "Yet ardently enough\u2014like a vestal candle burning\u2014",
    "For a little heat in a cold house."

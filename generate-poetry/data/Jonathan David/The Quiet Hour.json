    "When the hour is hushed and you lie still,",
    "So quiet is the room about me",
    "It seems perhaps that you are gone,",
    "Sunken to a marble sleep.",
    "I hear no sound; my quiet will,",
    "Passive as the lambs at rest,",
    "Stirs not the quaint forgetfulness",
    "But only murmurs, \u201cSleep is strange!\u201d",
    "The low moon at the lattice going",
    "Rests no more quietly than you at peace.",
    "Hushed is the candle; the hour is late,",
    "And I, poor witness of extreme change,",
    "I think perhaps then heaven opens",
    "Like the unfolding of your hand in sleep\u2014",
    "Your cold white hand\u2014to close again\u2014",
    "While I sit staring at the marble gate."

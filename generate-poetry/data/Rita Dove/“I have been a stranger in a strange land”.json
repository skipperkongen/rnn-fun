    "It wasn't bliss. What was bliss",
    "but the ordinary life? She'd spend hours",
    "in patter, moving through whole days",
    "touching, sniffing, tasting . . . exquisite",
    "housekeeping in a charmed world.",
    "And yet there was always",
    "more of the same, all that happiness,",
    "the aimless Being There.",
    "So she wandered for a while, bush to arbor,",
    "lingered to look through a pond's restive mirror.",
    "He was off cataloging the universe, probably,",
    "pretending he could organize",
    "what was clearly someone else's chaos.",
    "That's when she found the tree,",
    "the dark, crabbed branches",
    "bearing up such speechless bounty,",
    "she knew without being told",
    "this was forbidden. It wasn't",
    "a question of ownership\u2014",
    "who could lay claim to",
    "such maddening perfection?",
    "And there was no voice in her head,",
    "no whispered intelligence lurking",
    "in the leaves\u2014just an ache that grew",
    "until she knew she'd already lost everything",
    "except desire, the red heft of it",
    "warming her outstretched palm."

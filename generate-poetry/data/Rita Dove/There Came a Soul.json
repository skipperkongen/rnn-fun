    "She arrived as near to virginal",
    "as girls got in those days\u2014i.e., young,",
    "the requisite dewy cheek",
    "flushed at its own daring.",
    "He had hoped for a little more edge.",
    "But she held the newspaper rolled like a scepter,",
    "his advertisement turned up to prove",
    "she was there solely at his bidding\u2014and yet",
    "the gold band, the photographs ... a mother, then.",
    "He placed her in the old garden chair,",
    "the same one he went to evenings",
    "when the first tug on the cord sent the bulb",
    "swinging like the lamps in the medic\u2019s tent",
    "over the wounded, swaddled shapes that moaned",
    "each time the Screaming Meemies let loose,",
    "their calculated shrieks so far away",
    "he thought of crickets\u2014while all around him",
    "matted gauze and ether pricked up",
    "an itch so bad he could hardly sketch",
    "each clean curve of tissue opening.",
    "Nothing special but it\u2019s there, wicker",
    "fraying under my calming fingers.",
    "What if he changed the newspaper into a letter,",
    "then ripped it up and tucked the best part",
    "from view? How much he needed that desecrated",
    "scrap! And the red comb snarled with a few",
    "pale hairs for God in his infinite greed",
    "to snatch upon like a hawk targeting a sparrow\u2014",
    "he couldn\u2019t say",
    "so he kept to his task, applying paint",
    "like a bandage to the open wound.",
    "Pretty Ida, out to earn a penny",
    "for her tiny brood.",
    "He didn\u2019t mask the full lips",
    "or the way all the niggling fears",
    "of an adolescent century",
    "shone through her hesitant eyes,",
    "but he painted the room out, blackened",
    "every casement, every canvas drying",
    "along the wall, even the ailing coffeepot",
    "whose dim brew she politely refused,",
    "until she was seated",
    "as he had been, dropped",
    "bleak and thick,",
    "onto the last chair in the world."

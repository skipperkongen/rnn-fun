    "I could pick anything and think of you\u2014",
    "This lamp, the wind-still rain, the glossy blue",
    "My pen exudes, drying matte, upon the page.",
    "I could choose any hero, any cause or age",
    "And, sure as shooting arrows to the heart,",
    "Astride a dappled mare, legs braced as far apart",
    "As standing in silver stirrups will allow\u2014",
    "There you'll be, with furrowed brow",
    "And chain mail glinting, to set me free:",
    "One eye smiling, the other firm upon the enemy.",
    "This post-postmodern age is all business: compact disks",
    "And faxes, a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks",
    "Event. Today a hurricane is nudging up the coast,",
    "Oddly male: Big Bad Floyd, who brings a host",
    "Of daydreams: awkward reminiscences",
    "Of teenage crushes on worthless boys",
    "Whose only talent was to kiss you senseless.",
    "They all had sissy names\u2014Marcel, Percy, Dewey;",
    "Were thin as licorice and as chewy,",
    "Sweet with a dark and hollow center. Floyd's",
    "Cussing up a storm. You're bunkered in your",
    "Aerie, I'm perched in mine",
    "(Twin desks, computers, hardwood floors):",
    "We're content, but fall short of the Divine.",
    "Still, it's embarrassing, this happiness\u2014",
    "Who's satisfied simply with what's good for us,",
    "When has the ordinary ever been news?",
    "And yet, because nothing else will do",
    "To keep me from melancholy (call it blues),",
    "I fill this stolen time with you."

    "She mutters as she irons alterations",

    "and stale Evening of Paris.",

    "into a gusset, waits until",
    "the puckers bloom away. Beyond",
    "the curtain, the white girls are all",

    "how French ladies at court would tuck",
    "their fans in a sleeve",

    "they dropped excrement as daintily",
    "as handkerchieves. Against all rules",
    "she had saved the lining from a botched coat",
    "to face last year\u2019s gray skirt. She knows",
    "whenever she lifts a knee",
    "she flashes crimson. That seems legitimate;",

    "wearing powder and perfume and spraying",

    "of the",
    "A hanger clatters",
    "in the front of the shoppe.",
    "Beulah remembers how",
    "even Autumn could lean into a settee",
    "with her ankles crossed, sighing",
    "while smoking her cigarette down to the very end."

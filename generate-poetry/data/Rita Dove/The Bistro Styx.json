    "She was thinner, with a mannered gauntness",
    "as she paused just inside the double",
    "glass doors to survey the room, silvery cape",
    "billowing dramatically behind her.",
    "I thought, lifting a hand until",
    "she nodded and started across the parquet;",
    "that\u2019s when I saw she was dressed all in gray,",
    "from a kittenish cashmere skirt and cowl",
    "down to the graphite signature of her shoes.",
    "\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she panted, though",
    "she wasn\u2019t, sliding into the chair, her cape",
    "tossed off in a shudder of brushed steel.",
    "We kissed. Then I leaned back to peruse",
    "my blighted child, this wary aristocratic mole.",
    "\u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d I asked, and hazarded",
    "a motherly smile to keep from crying out:",
    "Are you content to conduct your life",
    "as a clich\u00e9 and, what\u2019s worse,",
    "an anachronism, the brooding artist\u2019s demimonde?",
    "Near the rue Princesse they had opened",
    "a gallery",
    "souvenir shop which featured",
    "fuzzy off-color Monets next to his acrylics, no doubt,",
    "plus bearded African drums and the occasional miniature",
    "gargoyle from Notre Dame the Great Artist had",
    "carved at breakfast with a pocket knife.",
    "\u201cTourists love us. The Parisians, of course\u201d\u2014",
    "she blushed\u2014\u201care amused, though not without",
    "a certain admiration ...\u201d",
    "The Chateaubriand",
    "arrived on a bone-white plate, smug and absolute",
    "in its fragrant crust, a black plug steaming",
    "like the heart plucked from the chest of a worthy enemy;",
    "one touch with her fork sent pink juices streaming.",
    "\u201cAdmiration for what?\u201d Wine, a bloody",
    "Pinot Noir, brought color to her cheeks. \u201cWhy,",
    "the aplomb with which we\u2019ve managed",
    "to support our Art\u201d\u2014meaning he\u2019d convinced",
    "her to pose nude for his appalling canvases,",
    "faintly futuristic landscapes strewn",
    "with carwrecks and bodies being chewed",
    "by rabid cocker spaniels. \u201cI\u2019d like to come by",
    "the studio,\u201d I ventured, \u201cand see the new stuff.\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, if you wish ...\u201d A delicate rebuff",
    "before the warning: \u201cHe dresses all",
    "in black now. Me, he drapes in blues and carmine\u2014",
    "and even though I think it\u2019s kinda cute,",
    "in company I tend toward more muted shades.\u201d",
    "She paused and had the grace",
    "to drop her eyes. She did look ravishing,",
    "spookily insubstantial, a lipstick ghost on tissue,",
    "or as if one stood on a fifth-floor terrace",
    "peering through a fringe of rain at Paris\u2019",
    "dreaming chimney pots, each sooty issue",
    "wobbling skyward in an ecstatic oracular spiral.",
    "\u201cAnd he never thinks of food. I wish",
    "I didn\u2019t have to plead with him to eat ....\u201d Fruit",
    "and cheese appeared, arrayed on leaf-green dishes.",
    "I stuck with caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me. \u201cThis Camembert\u2019s",
    "so ripe,\u201d she joked, \u201cit\u2019s practically grown hair,\u201d",
    "mucking a golden glob complete with parsley sprig",
    "onto a heel of bread. Nothing seemed to fill",
    "her up: She swallowed, sliced into a pear,",
    "speared each tear-shaped lavaliere",
    "and popped the dripping mess into her pretty mouth.",
    "Nowhere the bright tufted fields, weighted",
    "vines and sun poured down out of the south.",
    "\u201cBut are you happy?\u201d Fearing, I whispered it",
    "quickly. \u201cWhat? You know, Mother\u201d\u2014",
    "she bit into the starry rose of a fig\u2014",
    "\u201cone really should try the fruit here.\u201d",
    "I thought, and called for the bill."

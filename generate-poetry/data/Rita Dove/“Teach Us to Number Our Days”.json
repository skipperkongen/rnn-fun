    "In the old neighborhood, each funeral parlor",
    "is more elaborate than the last.",
    "The alleys smell of cops, pistols bumping their thighs,",
    "each chamber steeled with a slim blue bullet.",
    "Low-rent balconies stacked to the sky.",
    "A boy plays tic-tac-toe on a moon",
    "crossed by TV antennae, dreams",
    "he has swallowed a blue bean.",
    "It takes root in his gut, sprouts",
    "and twines upward, the vines curling",
    "around the sockets and locking them shut.",
    "And this sky, knotting like a dark tie?",
    "The patroller, disinterested, holds all the beans.",
    "August. The mums nod past, each a prickly heart on a sleeve."

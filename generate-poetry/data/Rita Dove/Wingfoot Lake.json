    "On her 36th birthday, Thomas had shown her",
    "her first swimming pool. It had been",
    "his favorite color, exactly\u2014just",
    "so much of it, the swimmers\u2019 white arms jutting",
    "into the chevrons of high society.",
    "She had rolled up her window",
    "and told him to drive on, fast.",
    "Now this",
    "four daughters",
    "dragging her to their husbands\u2019 company picnic,",
    "white families on one side and them",
    "on the other, unpacking the same",
    "squeeze bottles of Heinz, the same",
    "waxy beef patties and Salem potato chip bags.",
    "So he was dead for the first time",
    "on Fourth of July\u2014ten years ago",
    "had been harder, waiting for something to happen,",
    "and ten years before that, the girls",
    "like young horses eyeing the track.",
    "Last August she stood alone for hours",
    "in front of the T.V. set",
    "as a crow\u2019s wing moved slowly through",
    "the white streets of government.",
    "That brave swimming",
    "scared her, like Joanna saying",
    "What did she know about Africa?",
    "Were there lakes like this one",
    "with a rowboat pushed under the pier?",
    "Or Thomas\u2019 Great Mississippi",
    "with its sullen silks? (There was",
    "the Nile but the Nile belonged",
    "to God.) Where she came from",
    "was the past, 12 miles into town",
    "where nobody had locked their back door,",
    "and Goodyear hadn\u2019t begun to dream of a park",
    "under the company symbol, a white foot",
    "sprouting two small wings."

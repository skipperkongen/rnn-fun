    "I was four in this photograph fishing",
    "with my grandparents at a lake in Michigan.",
    "My brother squats in poison ivy.",
    "His Davy Crockett cap",
    "sits squared on his head so the raccoon tail",
    "flounces down the back of his sailor suit.",
    "My grandfather sits to the far right",
    "in a folding chair,",
    "and I know his left hand is on",
    "the tobacco in his pants pocket",
    "because I used to wrap it for him",
    "every Christmas. Grandmother's hips",
    "bulge from the brush, she's leaning",
    "into the ice chest, sun through the trees",
    "printing her dress with soft",
    "luminous paws.",
    "I am staring jealously at my brother;",
    "the day before he rode his first horse, alone.",
    "I was strapped in a basket",
    "behind my grandfather.",
    "He smelled of lemons. He's died\u2014",
    "but I remember his hands."

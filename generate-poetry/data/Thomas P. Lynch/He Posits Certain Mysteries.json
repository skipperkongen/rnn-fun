    "The body of the boy who took his flight",
    "off the cliff at Kilcloher into the sea",
    "was hauled up by curragh-men, out at first light",
    "fishing mackerel in the estuary.",
    "\u201cNo requiem or rosary\u201d said the priest,",
    "\u201cnor consecrated ground for burial,\u201d",
    "as if the boy had flown outside the pale",
    "of mercy or redemption or God\u2019s love.",
    "\u201cForgive them, for they know not what they do,\u201d",
    "quoth Argyle to the corpse\u2019s people,",
    "who heard in what he said a sort of riddle,",
    "as if he meant their coreligionists",
    "and not their sodden, sadly broken boy.",
    "Either way, they took some comfort in it",
    "and readied better than accustomed fare",
    "of food and spirits; by their own reckoning:",
    "the greater sin, the greater so the toll.",
    "But Argyle refused their shilling coin",
    "and helped them build a box and dig a grave.",
    "\u201cYour boy\u2019s no profligate or prodigal,\u201d",
    "he said, \u201conly a wounded pilgrim like us all.",
    "What say his leaping was a leap of faith,",
    "into his father\u2019s beckoning embrace?\u201d",
    "They killed no fatted calf. They filled the hole."

    "He\u2019ll have been the last of his kind here then.",
    "The flagstones, dry-stone walls, the slumping thatch,",
    "out-offices and cow cabins, the patch",
    "of haggard he sowed spuds and onions in\u2014",
    "all of it a century out of fashion\u2014",
    "all giving way to the quiet rising damp",
    "of hush and vacancy once he is gone.",
    "Those long contemplations at the fire, cats",
    "curling at the door, the dog\u2019s lame waltzing,",
    "the kettle, the candle and the lamp\u2014",
    "all still, all quenched, all darkened\u2014",
    "the votives and rosaries and novenas,",
    "the pope and Kennedy and Sacred Heart,",
    "the bucket, the basket, the latch and lock,",
    "the tractor that took him into town and back",
    "for the pension cheque and messages and pub,",
    "the chair, the bedstead and the chamber pot,",
    "everything will amount to nothing much.",
    "Everything will slowly disappear.",
    "And some grandniece, a sister\u2019s daughter\u2019s daughter,",
    "one blue August in ten or fifteen years",
    "will marry well and will inherit it:",
    "the cottage ruins, the brown abandoned land.",
    "They\u2019ll come to see it in a hired car.",
    "The kindly Liverpudlian she\u2019s wed,",
    "in concert with a local auctioneer,",
    "will post a sign to offer",
    ".",
    "The acres that he labored in will merge",
    "with a neighbor\u2019s growing pasturage",
    "and all the decades of him will begin to blur,",
    "easing, as the far fields of his holding did,",
    "up the hill, over the cliff, into the sea."

    "I\u2019ve long had what Soviet psychiatrists",
    "called \u201ca tendency toward vagrancy.\u201d",
    "At four I would run away from home",
    "repeatedly for a whole day, alone",
    "or sometimes with a friend named Boris",
    "of like age. Knew full well we \u201cjust can\u2019t do this,\u201d",
    "but nudge for nudge and wink for wink,",
    "we\u2019d board the trolleybus #10, I think,",
    "buy tickets at four kopeks each",
    "from our gleanings and savings of the week,",
    "stick them into the ticket punch on the wall,",
    "watch the chad fall as you pulled,",
    "and ride all across Kishinev in half an hour",
    "to get off near that unforgettable restaurant",
    "built in the likeness of a huge wine barrel.",
    "We peered inside, it was cool.",
    "Then we had options:",
    "go and splash in the local artificial lake",
    "(I couldn\u2019t swim yet),",
    "wonder in between along the banks,",
    "catching frogs to take home in a glass jar",
    "to populate a small construction pond (why",
    "did we always use",
    "shirt to do this?),",
    "or go and explore the local flea market,",
    "which was not at all safe to do,",
    "but even at four it\u2019s nice to have options.",
    "(One guy sold what we thought was a gun,",
    "we asked him and he confirmed it.)",
    "Those were days of cholera epidemics",
    "in Moldova. We\u2019d buy peasant-cooked",
    "fodder corn on the cob when we got hungry,",
    "haggled with old ladies over pennies.",
    "We wouldn\u2019t catch the return trolley until sunset.",
    "Then it\u2019s always the same picture:",
    "the wicket creaks open, the landlord\u2019s mutant",
    "barks through froth, my wet shirt clings.",
    "I step out of the dark",
    "toward my mother waiting by the door",
    "of our \u201ctemporary house\u201d on Kaluga Street,",
    "which was a bit of a dirt road, probably still is.",
    "She has been crying, takes me inside.",
    "Room and kitchen (no bathroom",
    "or running water): the room",
    "had a brick stove, the kitchen",
    "a dirt floor (with mice and sometimes grass)",
    "and a white washstand \u2014 these lines",
    "are all that has survived of them.",
    "There was great beauty in their squalor.",
    "She has been crying, takes me inside,",
    "says she will scold me later.",
    "I know it will be soon. First she must call",
    "the cops to tell them I\u2019ve been found.",
    "Of course, back then I didn\u2019t understand anything:",
    "neither how a poet harms his mother,",
    "nor how alienated (thank you, Marx, for that term)",
    "one can be from the start, and free",
    "in the grip of that greatest paradox of all \u2014",
    "a happy Soviet childhood."

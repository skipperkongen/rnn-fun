    "The tuba wakes before the man. It\u2019s a content animal:",
    "having no word, for the moment, suits it fine.",
    "It looks at him with a dun and smooth",
    "interiority, as a glass of rum might,",
    "or a worn number on an apartment building:",
    "his hands, crossed on the chest, rise and fall with breathing.",
    "In the dream, he\u2019s ringing the bell now; climbing,",
    "unlocking the door, peering into a glass.",
    "The flat is empty. Is the war over yet? Or",
    "was he here before the war? Soon, dropping salt levels",
    "will wake him\u2014",
    "in tears, with an odd groove in his palm, as though",
    "he\u2019d held on to an instrument for hours.",
    "For a good minute, he\u2019ll be nameless, and when",
    "a name does come, it won\u2019t be his:",
    "humming in thought the bright last name",
    "he rang on the doorbell, he\u2019ll see, in a certain",
    "abrupt sunlight: he\u2019d chosen",
    "her, then\u2014",
    "to be able to call everything something."

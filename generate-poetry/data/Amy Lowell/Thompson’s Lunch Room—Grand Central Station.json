    "Polished to cream surfaces",
    "By constant sweeping.",
    "The big room is coloured like the petals",
    "Of a great magnolia,",
    "And has a patina",
    "Of flower bloom",
    "Which makes it shine dimly",
    "Under the electric lamps.",
    "Chairs are ranged in rows",
    "Like sepia seeds",
    "Waiting fulfilment.",
    "The chalk-white spot of a cook\u2019s cap",
    "Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall\u2014",
    "Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow",
    "Thru the wavering uncertainty of steam.",
    "Vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections,",
    "Ice-green carboys, shifting\u2014greener, bluer\u2014with the jar of moving water.",
    "Jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass",
    "Rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar",
    "Above the lighthouse-shaped castors",
    "Of grey pepper and grey-white salt.",
    "Grey-white placards: \u201cOyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, Frankfurters\u201d:",
    "Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines.",
    "Dropping on the white counter like horn notes",
    "Through a web of violins,",
    "The flat yellow lights of oranges,",
    "The cube-red splashes of apples,",
    "In high plated",
    ".",
    "The electric clock jerks every half-minute:",

    "\u201cThree beef-steaks and a chicken-pie,\u201d",
    "Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily.",
    "A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair.",
    "Two rice puddings and a salmon salad",
    "Are pushed over the counter;",
    "The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them.",
    "A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone,",
    "And the sound throws across the room",
    "Sharp, invisible zigzags",
    "Of silver."

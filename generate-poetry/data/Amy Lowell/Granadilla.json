    "I cut myself upon the thought of you",
    "And yet I come back to it again and again,",
    "A kind of fury makes me want to draw you out",
    "From the dimness of the present",
    "And set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses.",
    "Then, going obviously to inhale their fragrance,",
    "I touch the blade of you and cling upon it,",
    "And only when the blood runs out across my fingers",
    "Am I at all satisfied."

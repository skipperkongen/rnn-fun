    "Why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples?",
    "Why do you dim yourself with folded silks?",
    "Do you not see that I can buy brocades in any draper\u2019s shop,",
    "And that I am choked in the twilight of all these colors.",
    "How pale you would be, and startling\u2014",
    "How quiet;",
    "But your curves would spring upward",
    "Like a clear jet of flung water,",
    "You would quiver like a shot-up spray of water,",
    "You would waver, and relapse, and tremble.",
    "And I too should tremble,",
    "Watching.",
    "Murex-dyes and tinsel\u2014",
    "And yet I think I could bear your beauty unshaded."

    "Not really a river at all,",
    "but a handshake between two Great",
    "Lakes, Huron stretching to embrace",
    "Erie in its green-gray grasp. You",
    "stitch the liquid boundary of",
    "a city dismantling itself,",
    "bricks unmortared, spires sagging, burnt",
    "out structures razed to open field.",
    "Prairies returning here, foxtails",
    "and chicory, Queen Anne\u2019s lace sways;",
    "tumbleweeds amble down Woodward",
    "Avenue, blow past fire hydrants,",
    "storefronts and rusted Cadillacs.",
    "You are the mirror into which",
    "we plunge. Towers of a stillborn",
    "renaissance bend to admire their",
    "vacant beauty; automobiles",
    "built in Mexico catch the chrome",
    "reflection of your waves. They speed",
    "across the bridge to the island",
    "whose willows spill their tears against",
    "your breast. Darkness closes our eyes;",
    "the park empties, bridge bears a chain",
    "of headlights. Perfume of exhaust",
    "drifts over your blackened currents;",
    "cars jostle for their place in line.",
    "Not the fist of one man but",
    "the sucker punch of a city",
    "taking scrappy pride in its bruised",
    "countenance. One bumper kisses",
    "another like gunshot; the town",
    "explodes. You swallow the blood of",
    "a woman\u2019s shattered cheekbone, pressed",
    "to metal hood, scorched by engine\u2019s",
    "heat.",
    "bitch \u2013 she got to pay fo\u2019 my car.",
    "So naked in our headlights. Her",
    "manicure rakes bridge\u2019s edge \u2013 some",
    "bystanders yell,",
    "\u2013 she lets go.",
    "You catch the women who plummet",
    "from the sky, seeking safety in",
    "your watery clutches. They root",
    "inside your skin; lungs swell with your",
    "essence. Arms wrestle the eddies",
    "but finally surrender, give",
    "themselves fully. Guardian dog",
    "of the bridge leans muzzle over",
    "the rail, slavering. The whole pack",
    "looks down, red eyes gleaming. She\u2019s lost",
    "to us, but we hear her singing",
    "forever in our dreams, gurgled",
    "lullaby for this drowned city."

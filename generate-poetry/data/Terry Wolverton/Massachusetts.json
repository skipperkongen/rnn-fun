    "We fought in Salem,",
    "as she nosed the rented car",
    "through streets that",
    "stubbornly refused to match",
    "the squiggled lines",
    "accordioning from my lap.",
    "She pressed me for direction",
    "as I spun the folding paper",
    "like a compass point,",
    "urged me for instruction",
    "as I traced the lines like Braille,",
    "my fingers blinded,",
    "tapping out the spell of history;",
    "I could not navigate this town.",
    "How could I explain",
    "the pall of Salem?",
    "There\u2019s not an inch on Earth",
    "that isn't steeped in blood\u2014",
    "corpses pushing up the cobblestones",
    "in every town,",
    "and the buildings that blunt the sky",
    "are girdered in bone.",
    "One could travel anywhere",
    "and feel that chill,",
    "the hovering of ghosts",
    "above the landscape,",
    "the past\u2019s damp breath",
    "against the ear.",
    "This town, though,",
    "descended like a shroud",
    "upon my holiday;",
    "Salem,",
    "its rectilinearity",
    "compressed the ribbon of my spine",
    "and sealed my thighs",
    "like doorways to a crypt;",
    "Salem,",
    "its somber abnegation,",
    "grimmest reprobation",
    "sought to suck me to a hollow shell",
    "through which the vengeful cries of God",
    "then could be heard.",
    "My lover, steering wheel in hand,",
    "stared into narrow streets",
    "with the eyes of a dark bird.",
    "\u201cWhich way,\u201d she cawed, \u201cwhich way?\u201d",
    "But mine glowed with the blankness",
    "of a woman swaying from a noose,",
    "clothing asunder,",
    "curses drowning in an airless throat,",
    "spirit driven from its home;",
    "it circled now above our heads.",
    "The useless atlas crumpled at my feet,",
    "it could not lead me to a place",
    "where threat did not bear down like heavy stones;",
    "we fought in Salem."

    "Who could have dreamed them up? At least snails",
    "have shells, but all these have is\u2014nothing.",
    "Small black antennae like fat pins wave",
    "as if they could take in enough to get them through.",
    "Turn them over, they\u2019re the soles of new shoes,",
    "pale and unmarked as babies. They flow,",
    "the soil itself learning how to move and, moving,",
    "almost staying still, their silver monorail",
    "the only evidence of where they\u2019d been.",
    "And they die quiet, or at least (thankfully)",
    "out of the human ear\u2019s range, between two stones,",
    "under heels, shriveling in salt or piss, at the tips",
    "of sharp sticks. Fight back, I hear myself say,",
    "do",
    ". Don\u2019t just take it. But they die",
    "as they had lived, exuding slime, like",
    "the smaller boys, who\u2019d just",
    "stand there, miserable in short pants,",
    "school socks down to their ankles,",
    "school tie unknotted and askew, and flowing",
    "from noses slow cauls of snot that",
    "from time to time they\u2019d lick or sniff back up",
    "part way, until it flowed again, coating",
    "the upper lip, falling into the mouth, mixing",
    "with tears before anything had been done,",
    "the fear itself enough, so even if we wanted",
    "we couldn\u2019t let them off. Sometimes it was",
    "the knee \u201cwhere you daren\u2019t show your mother,\u201d",
    "other times the kick in the shins, the stick over",
    "the head, the punch in the mouth, while they",
    "just stood there, or double up, gasping",
    "for breath, and we did it again."

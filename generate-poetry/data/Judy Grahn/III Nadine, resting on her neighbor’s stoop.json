    "She holds things together, collects bail,",
    "makes the landlord patch the largest holes.",
    "At the Sunday social she would spike",
    "every drink, and offer you half of what she knows,",
    "which is plenty. She pokes at the ruins of the city",
    "like an armored tank; but she thinks",
    "of herself as a ripsaw cutting through",
    "knots in wood. Her sentences come out",
    "like thick pine shanks",
    "and her big hands fill the air like smoke.",
    "She\u2019s a mud-chinked cabin in the slums,",
    "sitting on the doorstep counting",
    "rats and raising 15 children,",
    "half of them her own. The neighborhood",
    "would burn itself out without her;",
    "one of these days she\u2019ll strike the spark herself.",
    "She\u2019s made of grease",
    "and metal, with a hard head",
    "that makes the men around her seem frail.",
    "The common woman is as common as",
    "a nail."

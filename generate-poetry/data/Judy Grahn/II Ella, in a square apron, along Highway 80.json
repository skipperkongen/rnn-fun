    "She\u2019s a copperheaded waitress,",
    "tired and sharp-worded, she hides",
    "her bad brown tooth behind a wicked",
    "smile, and flicks her ass",
    "out of habit, to fend off the pass",
    "that passes for affection.",
    "She keeps her mind the way men",
    "keep a knife\u2014keen to strip the game",
    "down to her size. She has a thin spine,",
    "swallows her eggs cold, and tells lies.",
    "She slaps a wet rag at the truck drivers",
    "if they should complain. She understands",
    "the necessity for pain, turns away",
    "the smaller tips, out of pride, and",
    "keeps a flask under the counter. Once,",
    "she shot a lover who misused her child.",
    "Before she got out of jail, the courts had pounced",
    "and given the child away. Like some isolated lake,",
    "her flat blue eyes take care of their own stark",
    "bottoms. Her hands are nervous, curled, ready",
    "to scrape.",
    "The common woman is as common",
    "as a rattlesnake."

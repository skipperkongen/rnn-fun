    "\u201cGwawnowwdat,\u201d said Turnbull, \u201cand take a good look",
    "at the pain in a horse\u2019s eyes.",
    "If you\u2019d a pair of dragging hooves on you, it\u2019s short work",
    "they\u2019d make of the smile on your face.\u201d",
    "You could see that he understood, and his fellow-feeling",
    "for the pain in the horse\u2019s eyes;",
    "and that dwelling on it so long he\u2019d finally stolen",
    "into the innermost space",
    "of the horse\u2019s pain that I saw, too, trying to plumb",
    "the depths of pain that it felt;",
    "until it was Turnbull\u2019s eyes I saw starting out from",
    "that suffering horse\u2019s pelt.",
    "I looked at Turnbull and saw set under his brow",
    "as I looked him up and down twice",
    "the two, too-big eyes that were speechless with sorrow:",
    "the horse\u2019s eyes."

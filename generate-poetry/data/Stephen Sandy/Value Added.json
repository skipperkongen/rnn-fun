    "No one knew what the stones like squatting frogs",
    "signified. There they were, fuming in rows, out",
    "of the ground; every critic had his explanation",
    "or hers. But\u2014we had to remember\u2014they",
    "came to nothing, every one; those large stones",
    "out of the earth served the systems",
    "of those who considered them, as explaining",
    "something about the past it was important",
    "for the explainer to explain. And yet",
    "no one had any idea truly; there was no",
    "basis in fact for any view of them, and",
    "they remained like their origins\u2014or like",
    "smiling Olmec babies, sweet but ominous figures",
    "come from the earth to reproach us, almost",
    "cheerfully, for our ignorance\u2014a mystery, just",
    "as the probe of our feelings came up with nothing."

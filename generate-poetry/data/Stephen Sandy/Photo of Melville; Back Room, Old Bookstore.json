    "I passed him by at first. From the photograph",
    "Peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased",
    "From a lair of brows and beard: one not amazed",
    "At anything, as if to have looked enough",
    "Then turned aside worked best for him\u2014as if",
    "Night vision was the discipline that eased",
    "The weight of what he saw. A man\u2019s gaze posed",
    "Too long in the sun goes blank; comes to grief.",
    "That face could be a focus for this back room,",
    "For pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,",
    "Fond notes unread: each wary eye a phial",
    "Unstopped to let huge Melville out, to calm",
    "The sea of pages; Melville in older age:",
    "The grown man\u2019s sleepy defiance of denial."

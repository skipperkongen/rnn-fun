    "The great house birch with its girth he never quite",
    "could get his arms around, long felled, at last",
    "only its bark like a larva\u2019s husk in grass",
    "leaning neck-high, hollow below mansards.",
    "He does not live in the peeling mansion, but",
    "a more-than-ample keeper\u2019s cottage beyond",
    "rolled lawns and relics of Victorian elms",
    "where he muses in his study alcove. Touches",
    "the ancient coins, silver or bronze, their gleam",
    "on the baize-topped writing table \u2014 proud Athena",
    "helmeted; her owl agog beneath. Eternity",
    "glimpsed in the boy ruler Gordian\u2019s profile,",
    "copper green.",
    "Trees on guard in browed",
    "dignity now the seething barrack of bees.",
    "Nearby a maple twisted by wind for decades",
    "spirals, a stair winding above the cone",
    "of shade. In his covert the son, reading Herodotus,",
    "Suetonius \u2014 staggering run of drachmas,",
    "staters, tetradrachms, glinting in rows."

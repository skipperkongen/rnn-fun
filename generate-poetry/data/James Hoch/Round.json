    "Perhaps you covet something of",

    "in matters of yearning or feeling",
    "another\u2019s yearn, that it can\u2019t",

    "it gathers along its passage,",
    "the air it pushes through,",
    "swallow-like. It is no bird,",

    "you hear only after it\u2019s gone,",
    "even if it sings through paper,",
    "a goat, the neck of a man",
    "wearing a scarf that tufts just as",
    "the rest of him flies out of",
    "his shoes and collapses in dirt.",
    "Or, how it is like the dirt",
    "receiving him, the privilege",
    "of not knowing if he was",
    "kind or unkind, as you",
    "chamber another, waiting for",
    "someone to come for his shoes."

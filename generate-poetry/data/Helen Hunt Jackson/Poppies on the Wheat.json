    "Along Ancona\u2019s hills the shimmering heat,",
    "A tropic tide of air with ebb and flow",
    "Bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow",
    "Like flashing seas of green, which toss and beat",
    "Around the vines. The poppies lithe and fleet",
    "Seem running, fiery torchmen, to and fro",
    "To mark the shore.",
    "The farmer does not know",
    "That they are there. He walks with heavy feet,",
    "Counting the bread and wine by autumn\u2019s gain,",
    "But I,\u2014I smile to think that days remain",
    "Perhaps to me in which, though bread be sweet",
    "No more, and red wine warm my blood in vain,",
    "I shall be glad remembering how the fleet,",
    "Lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat."

    "Many of my race have lived long without the touch of",
    "these fine things which separate us from beasts. Things",
    "I call my own now. Having served thirty-six years as needleman",
    "for a family far more ape than we will ever be, I rode",
    "the moonlight train to find my free. Up here it is colder than I like,",
    "but the gentlemen admire my frock coats above all. I taught my son this trade",
    "and hope this picture I made will help retrieve him. Come summer I leave",
    "this coast for Philadelphia where I hear we of color can breathe yet more free.",
    "Tonight I stitch. The breeze off the bay smells of aria. It is almost the season for cloaks."

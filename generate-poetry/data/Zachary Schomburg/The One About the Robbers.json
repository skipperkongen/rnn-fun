    "You tell me a joke about two robbers who hide from the police. One robber hides as a sack of cats and the other robber hides as a sack of potatoes. That is the punch line somehow, the sack of potatoes, but all I can think about is how my dad used to throw me over his shoulder when I was very small and call me his sack of potatoes.",
    "he would yell, spinning around in a circle, the arm not holding me reaching out for a sale.",
    "No one ever wanted to buy me. We were always the only two people in the room."

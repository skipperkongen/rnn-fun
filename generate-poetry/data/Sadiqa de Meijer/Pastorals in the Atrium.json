    "I\u2019m ambushed by that flat-lined verdigris I\u2019d know even",
    "as a stumbling sleepwalker:",
    "with tin river, cleaver of sodden pastures \u2014",
    "marvelous for painters,",
    "says the docent, was the enormity",
    "of the sky, rarely cloudless, and she\u2019s already",
    "turning to an Italian hillscape when I say wait! this is",
    "my bloodstream, as my finger makes brief",
    "unintended contact with the canvas,",
    "and then my voice an ambulance",
    "I tell her there should be a diagram",
    "to indicate the grazing motion,",
    "how the grinding molars of the Holsteins",
    "make the river go \u2014",
    "or else, self-portrait",
    "in the glassing-over eye",
    "of a stickleback caged in a jam jar,",
    "left too long in the sun \u2014",
    "but now the river is across the room because",
    "the docent has ushered me toward an upholstered bench",
    "and is murmuring, sit, sit, I have here from the staff room",
    "a coffee, here you are \u2014",
    "and I\u2019m making the gesture for",
    "no, those fields I ate and was made of",
    "live in me, uncloseable",
    "parentheses"

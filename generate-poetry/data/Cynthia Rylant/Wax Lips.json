    "Todd\u2019s Hardware was dust and a monkey\u2014",
    "a real one, on the second floor\u2014",
    "and Mrs. Todd there behind the glass cases.",
    "We stepped over buckets of nails and lawnmowers",
    "to get to the candy counter in the back,",
    "and pointed at the red wax lips,",
    "and Mary Janes,",
    "and straws full of purple sugar.",
    "Said goodbye to Mrs. Todd, she white-faced and silent,",
    "and walked the streets of Beaver,",
    "our teeth sunk hard in the wax,",
    "and big red lips worth kissing."

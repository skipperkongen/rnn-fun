    "I know the origin of rocks, settling",
    "out of water, hatching crystals",
    "from fire, put under pressure",
    "in various designs I gathered",
    "pretty, picnic after picnic.",
    "And I know about love, a little,",
    "igneous lust, the slow affections",
    "of the sedimentary, the pressure",
    "on earth out of sight to rise up",
    "into material, something solid",
    "you can hold, a whole mountain,",
    "for example, or a loose collection",
    "of pebbles you forgot you were keeping."

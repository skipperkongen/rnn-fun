    "How glorious",

    "is how far a kiss can go.",
    "One can lose it when guilty.",
    "Be lashed by another\u2019s.",
    "Feel it twisting over rooky woods and wordless",
    "hear it swinging in a bell, sliding through a groove",
    "or placed firmly in a cheek. Beware it",
    "should be held most often for most often",
    "a forked one has no friend."

    "Glisten fretting the indigo of a plum,",
    "silvered chalk of moth-wing dust:",
    "the young man on the subway platform",
    "\u2014twenty maybe\u2014seems almost powdered,",
    "he is so dirty, the dust lighter",
    "than his skin, which is still,",
    "by a slight stretch of the imagination,",
    "lovely. Though it\u2019s odd to think",
    "of him that way, this shirtless kid",
    "in hugely oversized jeans that fall,",
    "when he stands, around his thighs,",
    "exposing his skinny ass. He yanks",
    "the waistband up, sits down again,",
    "and begins to writhe, palms roaming,",
    "uncontrollable, over his own face,",
    "his close-cropped hair and ears,",
    "down to his flanks, hands disappearing",
    "inside the big jeans, scratching",
    "and rubbing, until he collapses, exhausted,",
    "head hanging between his knees,",
    "and after a few seconds starts",
    "it all up again. Does he want",
    "to rub his own skin away? Then",
    "I understand: what\u2019s powdering his flesh is",
    "his flesh, the outest layer of himself",
    "rubbed to palest chalk. He repeats",
    "his stream of violent tableaux",
    "these might be positions of transport,",
    "of ecstasy, except he\u2019s miserable, I guess,",
    "and it\u2019s two in the afternoon, 96th and Broadway,",
    "and all of us waiting for the local",
    "watch, how can we help it?",
    ",",
    "somebody says, but it\u2019s a whisper, a question,",
    "and nothing answers our troubled fascination:",
    "nothing to do but watch the pity and terror",
    "of these poses. The express comes and goes,",
    "and the brutal series grows more synaptic:",
    "these might be flashes of the pornographic,",
    "or classical attitudes, rough trade posing",
    "as a captive slave for Michelangelo. Our context\u2019s",
    "neither intimate nor academic, and nothing\u2019s",
    "supposed to be so real in the common nowhere",
    "of the on-the-way-to, while we wait",
    "for the 1 or the 9, strangers and witnesses",
    "pressed knee to hem, back to shoulder",
    "on the platforms and cars. This month,",
    "on the broad haunches of the buses,",
    "another sleek boy\u2019s posed in multiple shots,",
    "black underwear and lean belly laved by rivulets",
    "from a shower or stream. The photographees",
    "left him headless, his gestures multiplied",
    "on builders\u2019 makeshift walls, page after page",
    "of blank torsos already beginning to be inscribed:",
    "on a yard of silvery muscle six feet from Seventh Avenue",
    "someone\u2019s scrawled, in black marker:",
    "Big buses",
    "nose through the streets, one after the other,",
    "bearing the model of what we\u2019re supposed to want,",
    "and do, what we\u2019re meant to see and need",
    "but not, unless we have the money, touch.",
    "He doesn\u2019t have the money, my boy",
    "on the platform, and I wish .... What?",
    "I don\u2019t know. Just today, in traffic,",
    "one of those buses eased by my taxi window:",
    "a taut wet waist bound in black elastic,",
    "huge, luminous emulsion inches",
    "from my face. The endlessly reprinted boy",
    "\u2014is he?\u2014could almost be this man,",
    "whitened by his own degrading skin,",
    "dark stone wearing the dust of the quarry.",
    "He\u2019s rubbing himself to flour, he\u2019s giving",
    "his name back to airy nothing, I\u2019m figuring him",
    "on the varnished bench. Moth, plum\u2014hear",
    "how the imagery aestheticizes? He\u2019s nothing",
    "as fixed as marble, and he touches himself",
    "not for pleasure but because he can\u2019t stop.",
    "What unthinkable train is he waiting for?",
    "That boy on the billboard, the headless boy,",
    "could he stop touching himself?",
    "We\u2019re all on display in this town,",
    "sweet machines, powerless, consumed,",
    "just as he consumes himself",
    "with those relentless hands,",
    "scratching his barely hidden center,",
    "hanging his head between his knees,",
    "spent, before he jerks himself up",
    "and starts all over again."

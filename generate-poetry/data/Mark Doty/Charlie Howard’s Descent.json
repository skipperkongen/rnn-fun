    "Between the bridge and the river",
    "he falls through",
    "a huge portion of night;",
    "it is not as if falling",
    "is something new. Over and over",
    "he slipped into the gulf",
    "between what he knew and how",
    "he was known. What others wanted",
    "opened like an abyss: the laughing",
    "stock-clerks at the grocery, women",
    "at the luncheonette amused by his gestures.",
    "What could he do, live",
    "with one hand tied",
    "behind his back? So he began to fall",
    "into the star-faced section",
    "of night between the trestle",
    "and the water because he could not meet",
    "a little town\u2019s demands,",
    "and his earrings shone and his wrists",
    "were as limp as they were.",
    "I imagine he took the insults in",
    "and made of them a place to live;",
    "we learn to use the names",
    "because they are there,",
    "familiar furniture:",
    "was the bed he slept in, hard",
    "and white, but simple somehow,",
    "something sharp",
    "but finally useful, a tool,",
    "all the jokes a chair,",
    "stiff-backed to keep the spine straight,",
    "a table, a lamp. And because",
    "he\u2019s fallen for twenty-three years,",
    "despite whatever awkwardness",
    "his flailing arms and legs assume",
    "he is beautiful",
    "and like any good diver",
    "has only an edge of fear",
    "he transforms into grace.",
    "Or else he is not afraid,",
    "and in this way climbs back",
    "up the ladder of his fall,",
    "out of the river into the arms",
    "of the three teenage boys",
    "who hurled him from the edge\u2014",
    "really boys now, afraid,",
    "their fathers\u2019 cars shivering behind them,",
    "headlights on\u2014and tells them",
    "it\u2019s all right, that he knows",
    "they didn\u2019t believe him",
    "when he said he couldn\u2019t swim,",
    "and blesses his killers",
    "in the way that only the dead",
    "can afford to forgive."

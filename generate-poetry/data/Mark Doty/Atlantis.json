    "\u201cI\u2019ve been having these",
    "awful dreams, each a little different,",
    "though the core\u2019s the same\u2014",
    "we\u2019re walking in a field,",
    "Wally and Arden and I, a stretch of grass",
    "with a highway running beside it,",
    "or a path in the woods that opens",
    "onto a road. Everything\u2019s fine,",
    "then the dog sprints ahead of us,",
    "excited; we\u2019re calling but",
    "he\u2019s racing down a scent and doesn\u2019t hear us,",
    "and that\u2019s when he goes",
    "onto the highway. I don\u2019t want to describe it.",
    "Sometimes it\u2019s brutal and over,",
    "and others he\u2019s struck and takes off",
    "so we don\u2019t know where he is",
    "or how bad. This wakes me",
    "every night now, and I stay awake;",
    "I\u2019m afraid if I sleep I\u2019ll go back",
    "into the dream. It\u2019s been six months,",
    "almost exactly, since the doctor wrote",
    "not even a real word",
    "but an acronym, a vacant",
    "four-letter cipher",
    "that draws meanings into itself,",
    "reconstitutes the world.",
    "We tried to say it was just",
    "a word; we tried to admit",
    "it had power and thus to nullify it",
    "by means of our acknowledgement.",
    "I know the current wisdom:",
    "bright hope, the power of wishing you\u2019re well.",
    "He\u2019s just so tired, though nothing",
    "shows in any tests, Nothing,",
    "the doctor says, detectable;",
    "the doctor doesn\u2019t hear what I do,",
    "that trickling, steadily rising nothing",
    "that makes him sleep all day,",
    "vanish into fever\u2019s tranced afternoons,",
    "and I swear sometimes",
    "when I put my head to his chest",
    "I can hear the virus humming",
    "like a refrigerator.",
    "Which is what makes me think",
    "you can take your positive attitude",
    "and go straight to hell.",
    "We don\u2019t have a future,",
    "we have a dog.",
    "Who is he?",
    "Soul without speech,",
    "sheer, tireless faith,",
    "he is that-which-goes-forward,",
    "black muzzle, black paws",
    "scouting what\u2019s ahead;",
    "he is where we\u2019ll be hit first,",
    "he\u2019s the part of us",
    "that\u2019s going to get it.",
    "I\u2019m hardly awake on our morning walk",
    "\u2014always just me and Arden now\u2014",
    "and sometimes I am still",
    "in the thrall of the dream,",
    "which is why, when he took a step onto Commercial",
    "before I\u2019d looked both ways,",
    "I screamed his name and grabbed his collar.",
    "And there I was on my knees,",
    "both arms around his neck",
    "and nothing coming,",
    "and when I looked into that bewildered face",
    "I realized I didn\u2019t know what it was",
    "I was shouting at,",
    "I didn\u2019t know who I was trying to protect.\u201d",
    "2.",
    "I woke in the night",
    "and thought,",
    "nothing has torn the future apart,",
    "we have not lived years",
    "in dread, it never happened,",
    "I dreamed it all. And then",
    "there was this sensation of terrific pressure",
    "lifting, as if I were rising",
    "in one of those old diving bells,",
    "lightening, unburdening. I didn\u2019t know",
    "how heavy my life had become\u2014so much fear,",
    "so little knowledge. It was like",
    "being young again, but I understood",
    "how light I was, how without encumbrance,\u2014",
    "and so I felt both young and awake,",
    "which I never felt",
    "when I",
    "young. The curtains moved",
    "\u2014it was still summer, all the windows open\u2014",
    "and I thought, I can move that easily.",
    "I thought my dream had lasted for years,",
    "a decade, a dream can seem like that,",
    "I thought,",
    "And then of course the truth",
    "came floating back to me.",
    "You know how children",
    "love to end stories they tell",
    "by saying, It was all a dream? Years ago,",
    "when I taught kids to write,",
    "I used to tell them this ending spoiled things,",
    "explaining and dismissing",
    "what had come before. Now I know",
    "how wise they were, to prefer",
    "that gesture of closure,",
    "their stories rounded not with a sleep",
    "but a waking. What other gift",
    "comes close to a reprieve?",
    "This was the dream that Wally told me:",
    "he said,",
    "and a great being standing in the light.",
    "His arms were full of people, men and women,",
    "but his proportions were all just right\u2014I mean",
    "he was the size of you or me.",
    "And the people said, Come with us,",
    "we\u2019re going dancing. And they seemed so glad",
    "to be going, and so glad to have me",
    "join them, but I said,",
    "I\u2019m not ready yet. I didn\u2019t know what to do,",
    "when he finished,",
    "except hold the relentless",
    "weight of him, I didn\u2019t know",
    "what to say except,",
    "nothing\u2019s wrong now,",
    "it was only a dream.",

    "Michael writes to tell me his dream:",
    "supporting him on one side",
    "with another friend on the other,",
    "and as we stood him up, he stepped out",
    "of the body I was holding and became",
    "a shining body, brilliant light",
    "held in the form I first knew him in.",
    "This is what I imagine will happen,",
    "the spirit\u2019s release. Michael,",
    "when we support our friends,",
    "one of us on either side, our arms",
    "under the man or woman\u2019s arms,",
    "what is it we\u2019re holding? Vessel,",
    "shadow, hurrying light? All those years",
    "I made love to a man without thinking",
    "how little his body had to do with me;",
    "now, diminished, he\u2019s never been so plainly",
    "himself\u2014remote and unguarded,",
    "an otherness I can\u2019t know",
    "the first thing about. I said,",
    "or you\u2019re going to turn into",
    "an old dry leaf. And he said,",
    "In the dream Randy\u2019s leaping into",
    "the future, and still here; Michael\u2019s holding him",
    "and releasing at once. Just as Steve\u2019s",
    "holding Jerry, though he\u2019s already gone,",
    "Marie holding John, gone, Maggie holding",
    "her John, gone, Carlos and Darren",
    "holding another Michael, gone,",
    "and I\u2019m holding Wally, who\u2019s going.",
    "Where isn\u2019t the question,",
    "though we think it is;",
    "we don\u2019t even know where the living are,",
    "in this raddled and unraveling \u201chere.\u201d",
    "What is the body? Rain on a window,",
    "a clear movement over whose gaze?",
    "Husk, leaf, little boat of paper",
    "and wood to mark the speed of the stream?",
    "Randy and Jerry, Michael and Wally",
    "and John: lucky we don\u2019t have to know",
    "what something is in order to hold it.",
    "4.",
    "I thought your illness a kind of solvent",
    "dissolving the future a little at a time;",
    "I didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s to come",
    "was always just a glimmer",
    "up ahead, veiled like the marsh",
    "gone under its tidal sheet",
    "of mildly rippling aluminum.",
    "What these salt distances were",
    "is also where they\u2019re going:",
    "from blankly silvered span",
    "toward specificity: the curve",
    "of certain brave islands of grass,",
    "temporary shoulder-wide rivers",
    "where herons ply their twin trades",
    "of study and desire. I\u2019ve seen",
    "two white emissaries unfold",
    "like heaven\u2019s linen, untouched,",
    "enormous, a fluid exhalation. Early spring,",
    "too cold yet for green, too early",
    "for the tumble and wrack of last season",
    "to be anything but promise,",
    "but there in the air was white tulip,",
    "marvel, triumph of all flowering, the soul",
    "lifted up, if we could still believe",
    "in the soul, after so much diminishment ...",
    "Breath, from the unpromising waters,",
    "up, across the pond and the two-lane highway,",
    "pure purpose, over the dune,",
    "gone. Tomorrow\u2019s unreadable",
    "as this shining acreage;",
    "the future\u2019s nothing",
    "but this moment\u2019s gleaming rim.",
    "Now the tide\u2019s begun",
    "its clockwork turn, pouring,",
    "in the day\u2019s hourglass,",
    "toward the other side of the world,",
    "and our dependable marsh reappears",
    "\u2014emptied of that starched and angular grace",
    "that spirited the ether, lessened,",
    "but here. And our ongoingness,",
    "what there\u2019ll be of us? Look,",
    "love, the lost world",
    "rising from the waters again:",
    "our continent, where it always was,",
    "emerging from the half-light, unforgettable,",

    "she says when I ask.",
    "Foolish kid,",

    "across her arm?",
    "Look at the steady,",
    "quiet eye. She is carrying",

    "of whatever rearrangement",
    "the elements intend,",
    "and the loon allows her.",

    "how much longer",
    "he\u2019ll be able to pet",
    "a dog. How many men",
    "want another attachment,",

    "leaving the world?",
    "Wally sits up nights",
    "and says,",
    "some lizards, a talking bird,",
    "some fish. A little rat.",
    "So after I drive",
    "to Jimi and Tony\u2019s",

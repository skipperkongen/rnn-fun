    "Downtown anywhere and between the roil",
    "of bathhouse steam\u2014up there the linens of joy",
    "and shame must be laundered again and again,",
    "all night\u2014downtown anywhere",
    "and between the column of feathering steam",
    "unknotting itself thirty feet above the avenue\u2019s",
    "shimmered azaleas of gasoline,",
    "between the steam and the ruin",
    "of the Cinema Paree (marquee advertising",
    "its own milky vacancy, broken showcases sealed,",
    "ticketbooth a hostage wrapped in tape",
    "and black plastic, captive in this zone",
    "of blackfronted bars and bookstores",
    "where there\u2019s nothing to read",
    "but longing\u2019s repetitive texts,",
    "where desire\u2019s unpoliced, or nearly so)",
    "someone\u2019s posted a xeroxed headshot",
    "of Jesus: permed, blonde, blurred at the edges",
    "as though photographed through a greasy lens,",
    "and inked beside him, in marker strokes:",
    "HOMO WILL NOT INHERIT.",
    ".",
    "I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll inherit: the margins",
    "which have always been mine, downtown after hours",
    "when there\u2019s nothing left to buy,",
    "the dreaming shops turned in on themselves,",
    "seamless, intent on the perfection of display,",
    "the bodegas and offices lined up, impenetrable:",
    "edges no one wants, no one\u2019s watching. Though",
    "the borders of this shadow-zone (mirror and dream",
    "of the shattered streets around it) are chartered",
    "by the police, and they are required,",
    "some nights, to redefine them. But not now, at twilight,",
    "permission\u2019s descending hour, early winter darkness",
    "pillared by smoldering plumes. The public city\u2019s",
    "ledgered and locked, but the secret city\u2019s boundless;",
    "from which do these tumbling towers arise?",
    "I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll inherit: steam,",
    "and the blinding symmetry of some towering man,",
    "fifteen minutes of forgetfulness incarnate.",
    "I\u2019ve seen flame flicker around the edges of the body,",
    "pentecostal, evidence of inhabitation.",
    "And I have been possessed of the god myself,",
    "I have been the temporary apparition",
    "salving another, I have been his visitation, I say it",
    "without arrogance, I have been an angel",
    "for minutes at a time, and I have for hours",
    "believed\u2014without judgement, without condemnation\u2014",
    "that in each body, however obscured or recast,",
    "is the divine body\u2014common, habitable\u2014",
    "the way in a field of sunflowers",
    "you can see every bloom\u2019s",
    "the multiple expression",
    "of a single shining idea,",
    "which is the face hammered into joy.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll inherit:",
    "stupidity, erasure, exile",
    "inside the chalked lines of the police,",
    "who must resemble what they punish,",
    "the exile you require of me,",
    "you who\u2019s posted this invitation",
    "to a heaven nobody wants.",
    "You who must be patrolled,",
    "who adore constraint, I\u2019ll tell you",
    "what I\u2019ll inherit, not your pallid temple",
    "but a real palace, the anticipated",
    "and actual memory, the moment flooded",
    "by skin and the knowledge of it,",
    "the gesture and its description",
    "\u2014do I need to say it?\u2014",
    "the flesh",
    "the word. And I\u2019ll tell you,",
    "you who can\u2019t wait to abandon your body,",
    "what you want me to, maybe something",
    "like you\u2019ve imagined, a dirty story:",
    "Years ago, in the baths,",
    "a man walked into the steam,",
    "the gorgeous deep indigo of him gleaming,",
    "solid tight flanks, the intricately ridged abdomen\u2014",
    "and after he invited me to his room,",
    "nudging his key toward me,",
    "as if perhaps I spoke another tongue",
    "and required the plainest of gestures,",
    "after we\u2019d been, you understand,",
    "worshipping a while in his church,",
    "he said to me,",
    "I can\u2019t tell you what that did to me.",
    "My shame was redeemed then;",
    "I won\u2019t need to burn in the afterlife.",
    "It wasn\u2019t that he hurt me,",
    "more than that: the spirit\u2019s transactions",
    "are enacted now, here\u2014no one needs",
    "your eternity. This failing city\u2019s",
    "radiant as any we\u2019ll ever know,",
    "paved with oily rainbow, charred gates",
    "jeweled with tags, swoops of letters",
    "over letters, indecipherable as anything",
    "written by desire. I\u2019m not ashamed",
    "to love Babylon\u2019s scrawl. How could I be?",
    "It\u2019s written on my face as much as on",
    "these walls. This city\u2019s inescapable,",
    "gorgeous, and on fire. I have my kingdom."

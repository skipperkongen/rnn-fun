    "Death found strange beauty on that cherub brow,",
    "And dash\u2019d it out. \u2013 There was a tint of rose",
    "O\u2019er cheek and lip; \u2013 he touch\u2019d the veins with ice,",
    "And the rose faded. \u2013 Forth from those blue eyes",
    "There spake a wistful tenderness, \u2013 a doubt",
    "Whether to grieve or sleep, which Innocence",
    "Alone can wear. \u2013 With ruthless haste he bound",
    "The silken fringes of their curtaining lids",
    "Forever. \u2013 There had been a murmuring sound",
    "With which the babe would claim its mother\u2019s ear,",
    "Charming her even to tears. \u2013 The spoiler set",
    "His seal of silence. \u2013 But there beam\u2019d a smile,",
    "So fix\u2019d and holy from that marble brow, \u2013",
    "Death gazed and left it there; \u2013 he dared not steal",
    "The signet-ring of Heaven."

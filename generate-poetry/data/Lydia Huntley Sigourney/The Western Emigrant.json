    "An axe rang sharply \u2019mid those forest shades",
    "Which from creation toward the skies had tower\u2019d",
    "In unshorn beauty. There, with vigorous arm",
    "Wrought a bold emigrant, and by his side",
    "His little son, with question and response,",
    "Beguiled the toil.",
    "\u2018Boy, thou hast never seen",
    "Such glorious trees. Hark, when their giant trunks",
    "Fall, how the firm earth groans. Rememberest thou",
    "The mighty river, on whose breast we sail\u2019d,",
    "So many days, on toward the setting sun?",
    "Our own Connecticut, compar\u2019d to that,",
    "Was but a creeping stream.\u2019",
    "\u2018Father, the brook",
    "That by our door went singing, where I launch\u2019d",
    "My tiny boat, with my young playmates round,",
    "When school was o\u2019er, is dearer far to me,",
    "Than all these bold, broad waters. To my eye",
    "They are as strangers. And those little trees",
    "My mother nutur\u2019d in the garden bound,",
    "Of our first home, from whence the fragrant peach",
    "Hung in its ripening gold, were fairer sure,",
    "Than this dark forest, shutting out the day.\u2019",
    "\u2014\u2018What, ho! \u2013 my little girl,\u2019 and with light step",
    "A fairy creature hasted toward her sire,",
    "And setting down the basket that contain\u2019d",
    "His noon-repast, look\u2019d upward to his face",
    "With sweet, confiding smile.",
    "\u2018See, dearest, see,",
    "That bright-wing\u2019d paroquet, and hear the song",
    "Of yon gay red-bird, echoing through the trees,",
    "Making rich music. Didst thou ever hear,",
    "In far New England, such a mellow tone?\u2019",
    "\u2014\u2018I had a robin that did take the crumbs",
    "Each night and morning, and his chirping voice",
    "Still made me joyful, as I went to tend",
    "My snow-drops. I was always laughing then",
    "In that first home. I should be happier now",
    "Methinks, if I could find among these dells",
    "The same fresh violets.\u2019",
    "Slow night drew on,",
    "And round the rude hut of the Emigrant",
    "The wrathful spirit of the rising storm",
    "Spake bitter things. His weary children slept,",
    "And he, with head declin\u2019d, sat listening long",
    "To the swoln waters of the Illinois,",
    "Dashing against their shores.",
    "Starting he spake,\u2014",
    "\u2018Wife! did I see thee brush away a tear?",
    "\u2019Twas even so. Thy heard was with the halls",
    "Of thy nativity. Their sparkling lights,",
    "Carpets, and sofas, and admiring guests,",
    "Befit thee better than these rugged walls",
    "Of shapeless logs, and this lone, hermit home.\u2019",
    "\u2018No \u2013 no. All was so still around, methought",
    "Upon mine ear that echoes hymn did steal,",
    "Which \u2019mid the Church where erst we paid our vows,",
    "So tuneful peal\u2019d. But tenderly thy voice",
    "Dissolv\u2019d the illusion.\u2019",
    "And the gentle smile",
    "Lighting her brow, the fond caress that sooth\u2019d",
    "Her waking infant, reassur\u2019d his soul",
    "That wheresoe\u2019er our best affections dwell,",
    "And strike a healthful root, is happiness.",
    "Content, and placid, to his rest he sank,",
    "But dreams, those wild magicians, that do play",
    "Such pranks when reason slumbers, tireless wrought",
    "Their will with him.",
    "Up rose the thronging mart",
    "Of his own native city, \u2013 roof and spire,",
    "All glittering bright, in fancy\u2019s frost-work ray.",
    "The steed his boyhood nurtur\u2019d proudly neigh\u2019d,",
    "The favorite dog came frisking round his feet,",
    "With shrill and joyous bark, \u2013 familiar doors",
    "Flew open, \u2013 greeting hands with his were link\u2019d",
    "In friendship\u2019s grasp, \u2013 he heard the keen debate",
    "From congregated haunts, where mind with mind",
    "Doth blend and brighten, \u2013 and till morning rov\u2019d",
    "\u2019Mid the loved scenery of his native land."

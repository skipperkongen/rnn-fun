    "Morn on her rosy couch awoke,",
    "Enchantment led the hour,",
    "And mirth and music drank the dews",
    "That freshen\u2019d Beauty\u2019s flower,",
    "Then from her bower of deep delight,",
    "I heard a young girl sing,",
    "\u2018Oh, speak no ill of poetry,",
    "For \u2019tis a holy thing.\u2019",
    "The Sun in noon-day heat rose high,",
    "And on the heaving breast,",
    "I saw a weary pilgrim toil",
    "Unpitied and unblest,",
    "Yet still in trembling measures flow\u2019d",
    "Forth from a broken string,",
    "\u2018Oh, speak no ill of poetry,",
    "For \u2019tis a holy thing.\u2019",
    "\u2019Twas night, and Death the curtains drew,",
    "\u2019Mid agony severe,",
    "While there a willing spirit went",
    "Home to a glorious sphere,",
    "Yet still it sigh\u2019d, even when was spread",
    "The waiting Angel\u2019s wing,",
    "\u2018Oh, speak no ill of poetry,",
    "For \u2019tis a holy thing.\u2019"

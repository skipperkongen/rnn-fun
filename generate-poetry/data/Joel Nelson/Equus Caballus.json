    "I have run on middle fingernail through Eolithic morning,",
    "I have thundered down the coach road with the Revolution\u2019s warning.",
    "I have carried countless errant knights who never found the grail.",
    "I have strained before the caissons I have moved the nation\u2019s mail.",
    "I\u2019ve made knights of lowly tribesmen and kings from ranks of peons",
    "I have given pride and arrogance to riding men for eons.",
    "I have grazed among the lodges and the tepees and the yurts.",
    "I have felt the sting of driving whips, lashes, spurs and quirts.",
    "I am roguish \u2013 I am flighty \u2013 I am inbred \u2013 I am lowly.",
    "I\u2019m a nightmare \u2013 I am wild \u2013 I am the horse.",
    "I am gallant and exalted \u2013 I am stately \u2013 I am noble.",
    "I\u2019m impressive \u2013 I am grand \u2013 I am the horse.",
    "I have suffered gross indignities from users and from winners,",
    "I have felt the hand of kindness from the losers and the sinners.",
    "I have given for the cruel hand and given for the kind.",
    "Heaved a sigh at Appomattox when surrender had been signed.",
    "I can be as tough as hardened steel \u2013 as fragile as a flower.",
    "I know not my endurance and I know not my own power.",
    "I have died with heart exploded \u2019neath the cheering in the stands -",
    "Calmly stood beneath the hanging noose of vigilante bands.",
    "I have traveled under conqueror and underneath the beaten.",
    "I have never chosen sides \u2013 I am the horse.",
    "The world is but a player\u2019s stage \u2013 my roles have numbered many.",
    "Under blue or under gray \u2013 I am the horse.",
    "So I\u2019ll run on middle fingernail until the curtain closes,",
    "And I will win your triple crowns and I will wear your roses.",
    "Toward you who took my freedom I\u2019ve no malice or remorse.",
    "I\u2019ll endure \u2013 This Is My Year \u2013 I am the Horse!"

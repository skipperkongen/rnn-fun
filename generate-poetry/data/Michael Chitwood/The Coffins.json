    "from an adventurer\u2019s flag ship,",
    "brass plating and grips,",
    "walnut sheen, scroll work,",
    "they slip through the understory",
    "on this brief, bad river.",
    "What have they discovered",
    "and come back to account?",
    "Or is this the beginning",
    "of the marvelous voyage",
    "and they plan never to return?"

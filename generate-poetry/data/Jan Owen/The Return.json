    "with one plait loose, a pip in your teeth",
    "and late for Geography, lined and blank,",
    "facts to the right, tall stories left.",
    "To sail the heat in a weatherboard classroom boat",
    "with banana and vegemite colouring the air",
    "sargasso green. To ship ten thousand things",
    "on cursive seas to the edge of the known page",
    "\u2014coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves.",
    "To import small desires and grown-up needs",
    "in little packets of time for show and tell.",
    "To carve your name on the prow.",
    "To wait for the bell.",
    "only the French clock answered back.",
    "They sat cross-legged on the Persian carpet;",
    "destinations flashed by",
    "the smell of Marveer, lavender, dusty velvet.",
    "They opened their eyes in the olden times",
    "to fossick under the coffin flaps",
    "of the jarrah window seat",
    "for proper advice from disheveled magazines:",

    "the runt who smoked and the chap who rowed.",
    "They didn\u2019t see foresight\u2019s guarded smile,",
    "they didn\u2019t hear hindsight howl like a dog;",
    "the riddles were wordy, the clues were dumb:",
    "lopped head of a doll, silk wedding sleeve,",
    "gilt volumes, silverfish,",
    "and in the glass case,",
    "untouchable figurines locked away",
    "as grown-ups always seemed to be:",
    "shepherd and shepherdess on their marks,",
    "Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Limoges?",
    "The real thing?",
    "cover Willunga Plains: like the misty breath",
    "of winter children, the blossom hovers. Dearth,",
    "says the black bark, splits to let scent through",
    "with open questions",
    "As for that earliest aroma fear,",
    "she\u2019d smell it, taste it, anywhere,",
    "one part in a million, pungent as coffee or smoke,",
    "already there in her mother\u2019s milk.",
    "Against its grey unbeing she caught",
    "at talismans \u2013 black stones on a white plate,",
    "concrete nouns clattering out of thought.",
    "Marking time down the dead-end street",
    "to morning. Why was it always dark",
    "in the quiet hall? Through a memory crack",
    "of light an edge squeezed round the door:",
    "the air",
    "elliptic with tracer fire, familiar eyes",
    "glancing away, prismatic as flies\u2019.",
    "Voices crept and huddled,",
    "He did come back, but who? They could not tell.",
    "Collections began. The tang of foreign coins",
    "lent her a lingo and currency for the unknown;",
    "Brother stuck down squares of expedited",
    "love with serrated edges. And they were invited",
    "to a fancy-dress ball with games of us and them.",

    "so they learned dolls and trains and night and day",
    "and Snakes and Ladders and Hide and Seek.",
    "Knight\u2019s gambit. Castle your king. Check.",
    "And when the black door opened and they knew",
    "threshold was famished, Brother stepped through.",
    "Now fear had her ID and her address.",
    "Best send an invitation. Tell her guest",
    "the lightest thing she served would ward off harm \u2013",
    "a stick, a stone, a cloud of white perfume,",
    "thought itself, needing a go-between",
    "to say \u2018this fragrance is like newborn skin,",
    "these quickening trees, like Mary\u2019s aging cousin",
    "conceiving all baptism out of season\u2019.",
    "as other women take up men",
    "and shelve them:",
    "manuals, grammars, Teach Yourself",
    "German, Malay, Italian, Swahili, Welsh,",
    "like a passion for clothes that would hang",
    "unworn in the dark,",
    "for peridots, garnets, amethysts, pearls",
    "in a shut case, nouns declined.",
    "Each unknown word shone with delicious fire",
    "and the alien phrases silked her skin",
    "with their genders and connotations.",

    "that sweeps a glitter of light",
    "across the sea and sets a silvery chill",
    "at the neck. Quick, to those books",
    "guarding the mantelpiece,",
    "ISBNs snug as a span of days;",
    "to bread and fruit and sparkling wine.",
    "She had been given a cyclamen with scent,",
    "some new trick that married violet and rose,",
    "as if a flower should yearn to sing",
    "and the pink timbre tremble",
    "into quietest words.",
    "She touched her flesh and knew",
    "that it would fade as speech did",
    "and did not.",
    "And yet it was not language that she sought,",
    "nor the music of any meaning.",
    "An old allegiance drew her on",
    "beyond the first ground of thought",
    "and the idea even of silence",
    "to the fifth season which must at last return",
    "with its weather of recognition",
    "and its lost ends."

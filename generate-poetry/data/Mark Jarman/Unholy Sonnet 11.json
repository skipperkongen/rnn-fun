    "Half asleep in prayer I said the right thing",
    "And felt a sudden pleasure come into",
    "The room or my own body. In the dark,",
    "Charged with a change of atmosphere, at first",
    "I couldn\u2019t tell my body from the room.",
    "And I was wide awake, full of this feeling,",
    "Alert as though I\u2019d heard a doorknob twist,",
    "A drawer pulled, and instead of terror knew",
    "The intrusion of an overwhelming joy.",
    "I had said thanks and this was the response.",
    "But how I said it or what I said it for",
    "I still cannot recall and I have tried",
    "All sorts of ways all hours of the night.",
    "Once was enough to be dissatisfied."

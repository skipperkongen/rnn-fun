    "Drunk on the Umbrian hills at dusk and drunk",
    "On one pink cloud that stood beside the moon,",
    "Drunk on the moon, a marble smile, and drunk,",
    "Two young Americans, on one another,",
    "Far from home and wanting this forever\u2014",
    "Who needed God? We had our bodies, bread,",
    "And glasses of a raw, green, local wine,",
    "And watched our Godless perfect darkness breed",
    "Enormous softly burning ancient stars.",
    "Who needed God? And why do I ask now?",
    "Because I\u2019m older and I think God stirs",
    "In details that keep bringing back that time,",
    "Details that are just as vivid now\u2014",
    "Our bodies, bread, a sharp Umbrian wine."

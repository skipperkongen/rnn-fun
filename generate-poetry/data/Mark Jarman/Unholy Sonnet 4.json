    "Amazing to believe that nothingness",
    "Surrounds us with delight and lets us be,",
    "And that the meekness of nonentity,",
    "Despite the friction of the world of sense,",
    "Despite the leveling of violence,",
    "Is all that matters. All the energy",
    "We force into the matchhead and the city",
    "Explodes inside a loving emptiness.",
    "Not Dante\u2019s rings, not the Zen zero\u2019s mouth,",
    "Out of which comes and into which light goes,",
    "This God recedes from every metaphor,",
    "Turns the hardest data into untruth,",
    "And fills all blanks with blankness. This love shows",
    "Itself in absence, which the stars adore."

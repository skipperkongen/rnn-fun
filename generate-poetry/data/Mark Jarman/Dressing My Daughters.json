    "One girl a full head taller",
    "Than the other\u2014into their Sunday dresses.",
    "First, the slip, hardly a piece of fabric,",
    "Softly stitched and printed with a bud.",
    "I\u2019m not their mother, and tangle, then untangle",
    "The whole cloth\u2014on backwards, have to grab it",
    "Round their necks. But they know how to pull",
    "Arms in, a reflex of being dressed,",
    "And also, a child\u2019s faith. The mass of stuff",
    "That makes the Sunday frocks collapses",
    "In my hands and finds its shape, only because",
    "They understand the drape of it\u2014",
    "These skinny keys to intricate locks.",
    "The buttons are a problem",
    "For a surgeon. How would she connect",
    "These bony valves and stubborn eyelets?",
    "The filmy dress revolves in my blind fingers.",
    "The slots work one by one.",
    "And when they\u2019re put together,",
    "Not like puppets or those doll-saints",
    "That bring tears to true believers,",
    "But living children, somebody\u2019s real daughters,",
    "They do become more real.",
    "They say, \u201cStop it!\u201d and \u201cGive it back!\u201d",
    "And \u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d They\u2019ll kiss",
    "A doll\u2019s hard features, whispering,",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I know just why my mother",
    "Used to worry. Your clothes don\u2019t keep",
    "You close\u2014it\u2019s nakedness.",
    "Clad in my boots and holster,",
    "I would roam with my six-gun buddies.",
    "We dealt fake death to one another,",
    "Fell and rolled in filth and rose,",
    "Grimy with wounds, then headed home.",
    "But Sunday ... what was that tired explanation",
    "Given for wearing clothes that",
    "Scratched and shone and weighed like a slow hour?",
    "That we should shine\u2014in gratitude.",
    "So, I give that explanation, undressing them,",
    "And wait for the result.",
    "After a day like Sunday, such a long one,",
    "When they lie down, half-dead,",
    "To be undone, they won\u2019t help me.",
    "They cry, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d"

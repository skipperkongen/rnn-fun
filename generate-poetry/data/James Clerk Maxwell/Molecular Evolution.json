    "At quite uncertain times and places,",
    "The atoms left their heavenly path,",
    "And by fortuitous embraces,",
    "Engendered all that being hath.",
    "And though they seem to cling together,",
    "And form \u201cassociations\u201d here,",
    "Yet, soon or late, they burst their tether,",
    "And through the depths of space career.",
    "So we who sat, oppressed with science,",
    "As British asses, wise and grave,",
    "Are now transformed to wild Red Lions,",
    "As round our prey we ramp and rave.",
    "Thus, by a swift metamorphosis,",
    "Wisdom turns wit, and science joke,",
    "Nonsense is incense to our noses,",
    "For when Red Lions speak, they smoke.",
    "Hail, Nonsense! dry nurse of Red Lions,",
    "From thee the wise their wisdom learn,",
    "From thee they cull those truths of science,",
    "Which into thee again they turn.",
    "What combinations of ideas,",
    "Nonsense alone can wisely form!",
    "What sage has half the power that she has,",
    "To take the towers of Truth by storm?",
    "Yield, then, ye rules of rigid reason!",
    "Dissolve, thou too, too solid sense!",
    "Melt into nonsense for a season,",
    "Then in some nobler form condense.",
    "Soon, all too soon, the chilly morning,",
    "This flow of soul will crystallize,",
    "Then those who Nonsense now are scorning,",
    "May learn, too late, where wisdom lies."

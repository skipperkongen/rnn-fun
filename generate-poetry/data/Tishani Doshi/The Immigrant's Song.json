    "Let us not speak of those days",
    "when coffee beans filled the morning",
    "with hope, when our mothers' headscarves",
    "hung like white flags on washing lines.",
    "Let us not speak of the long arms of sky",
    "that used to cradle us at dusk.",
    "And the baobabs\u2014let us not trace",
    "the shape of their leaves in our dreams,",
    "or yearn for the noise of those nameless birds",
    "that sang and died in the church's eaves.",
    "Let us not speak of men,",
    "stolen from their beds at night.",
    "Let us not say the word",
    "Let us not remember the first smell of rain.",
    "Instead, let us speak of our lives now\u2014",
    "the gates and bridges and stores.",
    "And when we break bread",
    "in caf",
    "s and at kitchen tables",
    "with our new brothers,",
    "let us not burden them with stories",
    "of war or abandonment.",
    "Let us not name our old friends",
    "who are unravelling like fairy tales",
    "in the forests of the dead.",
    "Naming them will not bring them back.",
    "Let us stay here, and wait for the future",
    "to arrive, for grandchildren to speak",
    "in forked tongues about the country",
    "we once came from.",
    "they might ask.",
    "And you might consider telling them",
    "of the sky and the coffee beans,",
    "the small white houses and dusty streets.",
    "You might set your memory afloat",
    "like a paper boat down a river.",
    "You might pray that the paper",
    "whispers your story to the water,",
    "that the water sings it to the trees,",
    "that the trees howl and howl",
    "it to the leaves. If you keep still",
    "and do not speak, you might hear",
    "your whole life fill the world",
    "until the wind is the only word."

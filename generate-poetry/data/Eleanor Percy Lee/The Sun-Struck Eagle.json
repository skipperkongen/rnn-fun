    "I saw an eagle sweep to the sky\u2014",
    "The Godlike! \u2013 seeking his place on high,",
    "With a strong, and wild, and rapid wing\u2014",
    "A dark, and yet a dazzling thing;",
    "And his arching neck, his bristling crest,",
    "And the dark plumes quivering upon his breast;",
    "And his eye, bent up to each beam of light,",
    "Like a bright sword flash\u2019d with a sword in fight.",
    "I saw him rise o\u2019er the forest trees;",
    "I saw his pinion ride the breeze;",
    "Beyond the clouds I watched him tower",
    "On his path of pride \u2013 his flight of power.",
    "I watched him wheeling, stern and lone,",
    "Where the keenest ray of the sun was thrown;",
    "Soaring, circling \u2013 bathed in light:",
    "Such was that desert eagle\u2019s flight.",
    "Suddenly, then, to my straining eye,",
    "I saw the strong wing slack on high;",
    "Falling, falling to earth once more;",
    "The dark breast covered with foam and gore;",
    "The dark eyes\u2019 glory dim with pain;",
    "Sick to death with a sun-struck brain!",
    "Reeling down from that height divine,",
    "Eagle of heaven! such fall was thine!",
    "Even so we see the sons of light,",
    "Up to the day-beam steer their flight;",
    "And the wing of genius cleaves the sky,",
    "As the clouds rush on when the winds are high:",
    "Then comes the hour of sudden dread\u2014",
    "Then is the blasting sunlight shed;",
    "And",
    "fall in their agony,",
    "Sund-struck eagle! to die like thee!"

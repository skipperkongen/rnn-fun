    "Our father liked to play a game.",
    "He played that he was dead.",
    "He took his thick black glasses off",
    "and stretched out on the bed.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t twitch and didn\u2019t snore",
    "or move in any way.",
    "He didn\u2019t even seem to breathe!",
    "We asked,",
    "?",
    "We tickled fingers up and down",
    "his huge, pink, stinky feet\u2014",
    "He didn\u2019t move; he lay as still",
    "as last year\u2019s parakeet.",
    "We pushed our fingers up his nose,",
    "and wiggled them inside\u2014",
    "Next, we peeled his eyelids back.",
    "? we cried.",
    "I really thought he might be dead",
    "and not just playing possum,",
    "because his eyeballs didn\u2019t twitch",
    "when I slid my tongue across \u2019em.",
    ", we sobbed\u2014but to be sure,",
    "I jabbed him in the jewels.",
    "He rose, like Jesus, from the dead,",
    "though I don\u2019t think Jesus drools.",
    "His right hand lashed both right and left.",
    "His left hand clutched his scrotum.",
    "And the words he yelled\u2014I know damn well",
    "I\u2019m way too young to quote \u2019em."

    "Half awake, I was imagining",
    "a friend\u2019s young lover, her ash blonde hair, the smooth",
    "taut skin of twenty. I imagined her",
    "short legs and dimpled knees.",
    "The door scraped open,",
    "but eyes closed, I saw nothing. The mattress sagged.",
    "She laid her head on my chest, and murmured love",
    "against my throat, almost humming, approaching song,",
    "so palpable I could hold her only chastely,",
    "if this was chaste. I couldn\u2019t move my hand",
    "even to caress her freckled shoulder.",
    "So this is how imagination works, I thought,",
    "sadly. And when at last she spoke,",
    "she spoke with the amused voice of my wife,",
    "my wife who was at work but also here,",
    "pleased at the confusion she was causing.",
    "This is a lesson about flesh, isn\u2019t it?",
    "I asked.",
    ", she whispered on my throat",
    "as we made tense, pensive love.",
    "."

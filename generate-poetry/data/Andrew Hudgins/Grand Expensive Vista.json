    "past where electric tiki torches gleamed,",

    "now truly beguiled,",
    "at my hosts\u2019 grand",

    "A low gold",

    "against a plush black sky gauzed,",
    "even filigreed,",
    "with stars. Gowned",
    "in old-growth oaks glazed",
    "with moonlight over their autumn gilt,",
    "the hills glowed",
    "in concord with the golden moon. I lingered,",
    "glad\u2014discomfited and glad\u2014",
    "at what my friends\u2019 greed",
    "for beauty afforded me. I argued,",
    "self against self, what they\u2019d gained",
    "and lost, and me with them, entangled",
    "as friendship entangles. I nearly groaned",
    "aloud with want before my friend grabbed",
    "my elbow. \u201cGorgeous, eh?\u201d I grinned",
    "and agreed,",
    "my voice greased",
    "with hidden envy. From behind us, grilled",
    "sirloin, pedigreed",
    "meat sublimating on embers, triggered",
    "another hunger. Life was not just good,",
    "but too good:",
    "aged beef, aged wine after bourbon. We hungered,",
    "and all the way back to his engorged",
    "glass table, hunger was our guide."

    "Without intending to hide,",
    "the imagined copperhead",
    "hid on the path ahead,",
    "unseen on bronze leaves, unheard,",
    "and a mortal likelihood",
    "at every step. This was childhood,",
    "mine, the wood\u2019s jihad",
    "against a boy who\u2019d",
    "intruded among monkshood,",
    "wasp, tick, and nettles haired",
    "with needles. Scrub brush abhorred",
    "him with a horde",
    "of welts, bites, and stings, but he\u2019d",
    "never seen a copperhead,",
    "though he\u2019d looked hard",
    "taking, as he\u2019d been ordered, heed.",
    "The snake wasn\u2019t a falsehood,",
    "though, to him. Dread",
    "was his nature, and he hared",
    "through sunlight and shade, head",
    "swiveling for the copperhead",
    "he\u2019d begun to covet, the ballyhooed",
    "killer a camouflaged godhead",
    "on which his inborn faith cohered,",
    "and his priesthood."

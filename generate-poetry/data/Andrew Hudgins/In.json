    "When we first heard from blocks away",
    "the fog truck\u2019s blustery roar,",
    "we dropped our toys, leapt from our meals,",
    "and scrambled out the door",
    "into an evening briefly fuzzy.",
    "We yearned to be transformed\u2014",
    "translated past confining flesh",
    "to disembodied spirit. We swarmed",
    "in thick smoke, taking human form",
    "before we blurred again,",
    "turned vague and then invisible,",
    "in temporary heaven.",
    "Freed of bodies by the fog,",
    "we laughed, we sang, we shouted.",
    "We were our voices, nothing else.",
    "Voice was all we wanted.",
    "The white clouds tumbled down our streets",
    "pursued by spellbound children",
    "who chased the most distorting clouds,",
    "ecstatic in the poison."

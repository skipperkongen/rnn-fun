    "At the earliest ending of winter,",
    "In March, a scrawny cry from outside",
    "Seemed like a sound in his mind.",
    "He knew that he heard it,",
    "A bird\u2019s cry at daylight or before,",
    "In the early March wind",
    "The sun was rising at six,",
    "No longer a battered panache above snow . . .",
    "It would have been outside.",
    "It was not from the vast ventriloquism",
    "Of sleep\u2019s faded papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 . . .",
    "The sun was coming from outside.",
    "That scrawny cry\u2014it was",
    "A chorister whose c preceded the choir.",
    "It was part of the colossal sun,",
    "Surrounded by its choral rings,",
    "Still far away. It was like",
    "A new knowledge of reality."

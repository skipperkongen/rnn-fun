    "Come when the nights are bright with stars",
    "Or come when the moon is mellow;",
    "Come when the sun his golden bars",
    "Drops on the hay-field yellow.",
    "Come in the twilight soft and gray,",
    "Come in the night or come in the day,",
    "Come, O love, whene\u2019er you may,",
    "And you are welcome, welcome.",
    "You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,",
    "You are soft as the nesting dove.",
    "Come to my heart and bring it to rest",
    "As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.",
    "Come when my heart is full of grief",
    "Or when my heart is merry;",
    "Come with the falling of the leaf",
    "Or with the redd\u2019ning cherry.",
    "Come when the year\u2019s first blossom blows,",
    "Come when the summer gleams and glows,",
    "Come with the winter\u2019s drifting snows,",
    "And you are welcome, welcome."

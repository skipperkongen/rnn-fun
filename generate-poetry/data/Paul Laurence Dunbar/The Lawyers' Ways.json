    "I've been list'nin' to them lawyers",
    "In the court house up the street,",
    "An' I've come to the conclusion",
    "That I'm most completely beat.",
    "Fust one feller riz to argy,",
    "An' he boldly waded in",
    "As he dressed the tremblin' pris'ner",
    "In a coat o' deep-dyed sin.",
    "Why, he painted him all over",
    "In a hue o' blackest crime,",
    "An' he smeared his reputation",
    "With the thickest kind o' grime,",
    "Tell I found myself a-wond'rin',",
    "In a misty way and dim,",
    "How the Lord had come to fashion",
    "Sich an awful man as him.",
    "Then the other lawyer started,",
    "An' with brimmin', tearful eyes,",
    "Said his client was a martyr",
    "That was brought to sacrifice.",
    "An' he give to that same pris'ner",
    "Every blessed human grace,",
    "Tell I saw the light o' virtue",
    "Fairly shinin' from his face.",
    "Then I own 'at I was puzzled",
    "How sich things could rightly be;",
    "An' this aggervatin' question",
    "Seems to keep a-puzzlin' me.",
    "So, will some one please inform me,",
    "An' this mystery unroll\u0097",
    "How an angel an' a devil",
    "Can persess the self-same soul?"

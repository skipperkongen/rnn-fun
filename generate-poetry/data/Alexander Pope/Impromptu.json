    "In vain you boast poetic names of yore,",
    "And cite those Sapphos we admire no more:",
    "Fate doomed the fall of every female wit;",
    "But doomed it then, when first Ardelia writ.",
    "Of all examples by the world confessed,",
    "I knew Ardelia could not quote the best;",
    "Who, like her mistress on Britannia\u2019s throne,",
    "Fights and subdues in quarrels not her own.",
    "To write their praise you but in vain essay;",
    "Even while you write, you take that praise away.",
    "Light to the stars the sun does thus restore,",
    "But shines himself till they are seen no more."

    "Watching that frenzy of insects above the bush of white flowers,",
    "bush I see everywhere on hill after hill, all I can think of",
    "is how terrifying spring is, in its tireless, mindless replications.",
    "Everywhere emergence: seed case, chrysalis, uterus, endless manufacturing.",
    "And the wrapped stacks of Styrofoam cups in the grocery, lately",
    "I can\u2019t stand them, the shelves of canned beans and soups, freezers",
    "of identical dinners; then the snowflake-diamond-snowflake of the rug",
    "beneath my chair, rows of books turning their backs,",
    "even my two feet, how they mirror each other oppresses me,",
    "the way they fit so perfectly together, how I can nestle one big toe into the other",
    "like little continents that have drifted; my God the unity of everything,",
    "my hands and eyes, yours; doesn\u2019t that frighten you sometimes, remembering",
    "the pleasure of nakedness in fresh sheets, all the lovers there before you,",
    "beside you, crowding you out? And the scouring griefs,",
    "don\u2019t look at them all or they\u2019ll kill you, you can barely encompass your own;",
    "I\u2019m saying I know all about you, whoever you are, it\u2019s spring",
    "and it\u2019s starting again, the longing that begins, and begins, and begins."

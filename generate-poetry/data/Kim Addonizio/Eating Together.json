    "I know my friend is going,",
    "though she still sits there",
    "across from me in the restaurant,",
    "and leans over the table to dip",
    "her bread in the oil on my plate; I know",
    "how thick her hair used to be,",
    "and what it takes for her to discard",
    "her man\u2019s cap partway through our meal,",
    "to look straight at the young waiter",
    "and smile when he asks",
    "how we are liking it. She eats",
    "as though starving\u2014chicken, dolmata,",
    "the buttery flakes of filo\u2014",
    "and what\u2019s killing her",
    "eats, too. I watch her lift",
    "a glistening black olive and peel",
    "the meat from the pit, watch",
    "her fine long fingers, and her face,",
    "puffy from medication. She lowers",
    "her eyes to the food, pretending",
    "not to know what I know. She\u2019s going.",
    "And we go on eating."

    "I like to touch your tattoos in complete",
    "darkness, when I can\u2019t see them. I\u2019m sure of",
    "where they are, know by heart the neat",
    "lines of lightning pulsing just above",
    "your nipple, can find, as if by instinct, the blue",
    "swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent",
    "twists, facing a dragon. When I pull you",
    "to me, taking you until we\u2019re spent",
    "and quiet on the sheets, I love to kiss",
    "the pictures in your skin. They\u2019ll last until",
    "you\u2019re seared to ashes; whatever persists",
    "or turns to pain between us, they will still",
    "be there. Such permanence is terrifying.",
    "So I touch them in the dark; but touch them, trying."

    "Today the cloud shapes are terrifying,",
    "and I keep expecting some enormous",
    "black-and-white B-movie Cyclops",
    "to appear at the edge of the horizon,",
    "to come striding over the ocean",
    "and drag me from my kitchen",
    "to the deep cave that flickered",
    "into my young brain one Saturday",
    "at the Baronet Theater where I sat helpless",
    "between my older brothers, pumped up",
    "on candy and horror\u2014that cave,",
    "the litter of human bones",
    "gnawed on and flung toward the entrance,",
    "I can smell their stench as clearly",
    "as the bacon fat from breakfast. This",
    "is how it feels to lose it\u2014",
    "not sanity, I mean, but whatever it is",
    "that helps you get up in the morning",
    "and actually leave the house",
    "on those days when it seems like death",
    "in his brown uniform",
    "is cruising his panel truck",
    "of packages through your neighborhood.",
    "I think of a friend\u2019s voice",
    "on her answering machine\u2014",
    "the morning of her funeral,",
    "the calls filling up the tape",
    "and the mail still arriving,",
    "and I feel as afraid as I was",
    "after all those vampire movies",
    "when I\u2019d come home and lie awake",
    "all night, rigid in my bed,",
    "unable to get up",
    "even to pee because the undead",
    "were waiting underneath it;",
    "if I so much as stuck a bare",
    "foot out there in the unprotected air",
    "they\u2019d grab me by the ankle and pull me",
    "under. And my parents said there was",
    "nothing there, when I was older",
    "I would know better, and now",
    "they\u2019re dead, and I\u2019m older,",
    "and I know better."

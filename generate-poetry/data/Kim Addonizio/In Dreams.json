    "After eighteen years there\u2019s no real grief left",
    "for the man who was my father.",
    "I hardly think of him anymore,",
    "and those dreams I used to have,",
    "in which he\u2019d be standing in a room of people",
    "I didn\u2019t know\u2014maybe his new friends,",
    "if the dead have friendships\u2014",
    "those dreams no longer trouble my sleep.",
    "He\u2019s not in the crooked houses I wander through",
    "or in the field by the highway",
    "where I\u2019m running, chasing down",
    "some important piece of paper,",
    "desperate to reach it",
    "as it\u2019s lifted in the wake of trucks",
    "or flattened and marked by passing cars,",
    "as it\u2019s lifted again to swirl over",
    "a broken wood fence. I don\u2019t know why",
    "the paper\u2019s so important, or if anything",
    "is even written there.",
    "I don\u2019t know where the dead go,",
    "or why it\u2019s good to forget them,",
    "not to see them if they come crowding",
    "the windows or trying to lay themselves down",
    "and press along our bodies at night",
    "and ask that we love them again,",
    "that our sorrows include them once more.",
    "This morning I couldn\u2019t get up.",
    "I slept late, I dreamed of the single",
    "sheet of paper, which I never managed to reach",
    "as it stuttered and soared over the grass",
    "and a few flowers, so that I woke",
    "with a sense of loss, wondering who",
    "or what I had to mourn besides",
    "my father, whom I no longer mourn,",
    "father buried in the earth beneath grass,",
    "beneath flowers I trample as I run."

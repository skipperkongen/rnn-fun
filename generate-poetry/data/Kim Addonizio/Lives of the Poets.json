    "One stood among the violets",
    "listening to a bird. One went to the toilet",
    "and was struck by the moon. One felt hopeless",
    "until a trumpet crash, and then lo,",
    "he became a diamond. I have a shovel.",
    "Can I turn it into a poem? On my stove",
    "I\u2019m boiling some milk thistle.",
    "I hope it will turn into a winged thesis",
    "before you stop reading. Look, I\u2019m topless!",
    "Listen: approaching hooves!",
    "One drowned in a swimming pool.",
    "One removed his shoes",
    "and yearned off a bridge. One lives",
    "with Alzheimer\u2019s in a state facility, spittle",
    "in his white beard. It",
    "turns out words are no help.",
    "But here I am with my shovel",
    "digging like a fool",
    "beside the spilth and splosh",
    "of the ungirdled sea. I can\u2019t stop.",
    "The horses are coming, the thieves.",
    "I still haven\u2019t found lasting love.",
    "I still want to hear viols",
    "in the little beach hotel",
    "that\u2019s torn down and gone.",
    "I want to see again the fish",
    "schooling and glittering like a veil",
    "where the waves shove",
    "against the breakwater. Gone",
    "is the girl in her white slip",
    "testing the chill with one bare foot.",
    "It\u2019s too cold, but she goes in, so",
    "carefully, oh."

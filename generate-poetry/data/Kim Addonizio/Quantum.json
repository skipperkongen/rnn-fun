    "You know how hard it is sometimes just to walk on the streets downtown, how everything enters you",
    "the way the scientists describe it\u2014photons streaming through bodies, caroming off the air, the impenetrable brick",
    "of buildings an illusion\u2014sometimes you can feel how porous you are, how permeable, and the man lurching in circles",
    "on the sidewalk, cutting the space around him with a tin can and saying",
    "over and over",
    "is part of it, and the one in gold chains leaning against the glass of the luggage store is, and the one who steps toward you",
    "from his doorway, meaning to ask something apparently simple, like",
    ", something you know",
    "you can no longer answer; he\u2019s part of it, the body of the world which is also yours and which keeps insisting",
    "you recognize it. And the trouble is, you do, but it\u2019s happening here, among the crowds and exhaust smells,",
    "and you taste every greasy scrap of paper, the globbed spit you step over, your tongue is as thick with dirt",
    "as though you\u2019ve fallen on your hands and knees to lick the oil-scummed street, as sour as if you've been drinking",
    "the piss of those men passing their bottle in the little park with its cement benches and broken fountain. And it\u2019s no better",
    "when you descend the steps to the Metro and some girl\u2019s wailing off-key about her heart\u2014your heart\u2014",
    "over the awful buzzing of the strings, and you hurry through the turnstile, fumbling out the money that\u2019s passed",
    "from how many hands into yours, getting rid of all your change except one quarter you\u2019re sure she sees",
    "lying blind in your pocket as you get into a car and the doors seal themselves behind you. But still it isn\u2019t over.",
    "Because later, when you\u2019re home, looking out your window at the ocean, at the calm of the horizon line,",
    "and the apple in your hand glows in that golden light that happens in the afternoon, suffusing you with something",
    "you\u2019re sure is close to peace, you think of the boy bagging groceries at Safeway, of how his face was flattened",
    "in a way that was familiar\u2014bootheel of a botched chromosome\u2014and you remember his canceled blue eyes,",
    "and his hands, flaking, rash-reddened, that lifted each thing and caressed it before placing it carefully",
    "in your sack, and the monotonous song he muttered,",
    ", his mouth slack,",
    "a teardrop of drool at the corner; and you know he\u2019s a part of it too, raising the fruit to your lips you look out",
    "at the immense and meaningless blue and know you\u2019re inside it, you realize you\u2019re eating him now."

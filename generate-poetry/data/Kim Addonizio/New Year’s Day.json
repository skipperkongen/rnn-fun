    "The rain this morning falls",
    "on the last of the snow",
    "and will wash it away. I can smell",
    "the grass again, and the torn leaves",
    "being eased down into the mud.",
    "The few loves I\u2019ve been allowed",
    "to keep are still sleeping",
    "on the West Coast. Here in Virginia",
    "I walk across the fields with only",
    "a few young cows for company.",
    "Big-boned and shy,",
    "they are like girls I remember",
    "from junior high, who never",
    "spoke, who kept their heads",
    "lowered and their arms crossed against",
    "their new breasts. Those girls",
    "are nearly forty now. Like me,",
    "they must sometimes stand",
    "at a window late at night, looking out",
    "on a silent backyard, at one",
    "rusting lawn chair and the sheer walls",
    "of other people\u2019s houses.",
    "They must lie down some afternoons",
    "and cry hard for whoever used",
    "to make them happiest,",
    "and wonder how their lives",
    "have carried them",
    "this far without ever once",
    "explaining anything. I don\u2019t know",
    "why I\u2019m walking out here",
    "with my coat darkening",
    "and my boots sinking in, coming up",
    "with a mild sucking sound",
    "I like to hear. I don\u2019t care",
    "where those girls are now.",
    "Whatever they\u2019ve made of it",
    "they can have. Today I want",
    "to resolve nothing.",
    "I only want to walk",
    "a little longer in the cold",
    "blessing of the rain,",
    "and lift my face to it."

    "Written on a slat of a railway car:",
    "If some time someone should find pearls",
    "threaded on a blood-red string of silk",
    "which, near the throat, runs all the thinner",
    "like life\u2019s own path until it\u2019s gone",
    "somewhere in a fog and can\u2019t be seen\u2014",
    "If someone should find these pearls",
    "let him know how\u2014cool, aloof\u2014they lit up",
    "the eighteen-year-old, impatient heart",
    "of the Paris dancing girl, Marie.",
    "Now, dragged through unknown Poland\u2014",
    "I\u2019m throwing my pearls through the grate.",
    "If they\u2019re found by a young man\u2014",
    "let these pearls adorn his girlfriend.",
    "If they\u2019re found by a girl\u2014",
    "let her wear them; they belong to her.",
    "And if they\u2019re found by an old man\u2014",
    "let him, for these pearls, recite a prayer."

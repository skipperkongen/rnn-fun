    "Flashing in the grass; the mouth of a spider clung",
    "to the dark of it: the legs of the spider",
    "held the tucked wings close,",
    "held the abdomen still in the midst of calling",
    "with thrusts of phosphorescent light\u2014",
    "When I am tired of being human, I try to remember",
    "the two stuck together like burrs. I try to place them",
    "central in my mind where everything else must",
    "surround them, must see the burr and the barb of them.",
    "There is courtship, and there is hunger. I suppose",
    "there are grips from which even angels cannot fly.",
    "Even imagined ones.",
    "When I am tired of only touching,",
    "I have my mouth to try to tell you",
    "what, in your arms, is not erased."

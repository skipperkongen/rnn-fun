    "Behind the warped door that sticks,",
    "the wood thrush calls to the monks,",
    "pausing upon the stone crucifix,",
    "singing: \u201cI am marvelous alone!\u201d",
    "Thrash, thrash goes the hayfield:",
    "rows of marrow and bone undone.",
    "The horizon\u2019s flashing fastens tight,",
    "sealing the blue hills with vermilion.",
    "Moss dyes a squirrel\u2019s skull green.",
    "The cemetery expands its borders\u2014",
    "little milky crosses grow like teeth.",
    "How kind time is, altering space",
    "so nothing stays wrong; and light,",
    "more new light, always arrives."

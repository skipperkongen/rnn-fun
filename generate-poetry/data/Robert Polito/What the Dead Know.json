    "Air here is like the water",
    "Of an aquarium that\u2019s been lived in for a while\u2014clear and still",
    "Beyond the rigors",
    "Of glass; appearing cold (and clear) as spring streams",
    "Fed by snow and ice,",
    "But unexpectedly warm to feel, and inviting; side-lit\u2014",
    "A vitality of shadows",
    "Once you come into it, and long bars of light",
    "Burning like spots,",
    "Remarkable for the absence of dust in their sharp crossfires;",
    "Heavy, as crystal",
    "Is heavy, as if to move here would mean pushing against a force",
    "Palpable, and strong;",
    "Yet rich with prospects of life, comfortable",
    "With the idea of life,",
    "As if, put on its slide, every drop is stocked with wonders,",
    "Swarming, about to burst\u2014",
    "Beautiful in a way,",
    "One element sustaining another, our message brought home",
    "So that the living",
    "Might come to see. Harder to say that without them",
    "We are nothing\u2014",
    "Water without air; or to speak of our isolation,",
    "Or our special loneliness;",
    "Or say as they look right through us, at their plants,",
    "Pictures, books,",
    "Windows, reflections, and blank white walls,",
    "That we need them,",
    "To orient ourselves and to tell us who we are;",
    "Or that with each look",
    "They are swimming to within our sights; or that we are always casting",
    "Wider and wider",
    "And that even now they are fighting to avoid our nets."

    "I tracked it through the one mind of the woods.",
    "Its hoofprints pressed in snow were smallish hearts.",
    "Buck fawn: he let me come so near, take aim.",
    "Crouched against a fir, I was anything.",
    "Bush, stump, doe in estrus he could rut.",
    "Not his maimer, though, not his final thought.",
    "He stared me down until I shot him: low.",
    "Then the forest forgot he\u2019d ever been.",
    "Nascent, there were signs: bonechip, spoor, frail hair.",
    "But no memory, wounded, wants to die.",
    "He hid in the dark timber, twice crossed the creek.",
    "Finally he lay heaving out last breaths.",
    "Dusk-cast shadow, he died where he was made.",
    "A bite of heart sustains but is not him."

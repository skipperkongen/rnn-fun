    "All day the ravens shit the buck whitetail",
    "back onto his antlers, the thick arcing tines",
    "graffitied with undigested tendons. Coyote-",
    "dragged, draped in a squawking garment",
    "that rises tattered when redtail-harried \u2014",
    "revealing ribs, links of spine, tongue-clean",
    "sockets \u2014 and falls, in patches, back, stitched",
    "with wingsound. A feathered hush. Says you will",
    "go down in the dirt. First the four-leggeds",
    "ferrying your shape across the slough, yipping",
    "nothing resembling a name, large birds then like",
    "lamp-drawn moths, before the six-limbed elders",
    "arrive as one mind, as shifting soil, to polish",
    "what\u2019s left, forsaking only the inedible brain."

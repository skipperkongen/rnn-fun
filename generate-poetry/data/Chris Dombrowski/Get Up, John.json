    "Here comes dawn and nothing rosy",
    "about her fingers \u2014 stove-flame",
    "blue and some hand must\u2019ve turned",
    "the burner on: the little tongues",
    "licking, gradually, the teapot of us",
    "aboil, cooking off a giardia",
    "of stars, the dregs of our night-",
    "mares. Who will place his fingers",
    "in the nailmarks, come near enough",
    "to smell death in its hair? Already we\u2019ve",
    "some of us slid back into our bodies,",
    "restirring the air our breaths stirred",
    "all night \u2014 whoever we are while",
    "we sleep \u2014 and gone about believing",
    "we are here. Ambulance sirens",
    "assure us, a plum\u2019s sour skin, what\u2019s become",
    "of the poppies, dried all but greenless,",
    "etcetera. But the yearling child",
    "reaching into the lineaments of sun",
    "lancing between his crib bars \u2014 how might",
    "this shame us, that they seem",
    "to seem graspable to him?"

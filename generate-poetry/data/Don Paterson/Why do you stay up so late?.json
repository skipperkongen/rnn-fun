    "remember that day you lost two years ago",
    "at the rockpool where you sat and played the jeweler",
    "with all those stones you\u2019d stolen from the shore?",
    "Most of them went dark and nothing more,",
    "but sometimes one would blink the secret color",
    "it had locked up somewhere in its stony sleep.",
    "This is how you knew the ones to keep.",
    "So I collect the dull things of the day",
    "in which I see some possibility",
    "but which are dead and which have the surprise",
    "I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ve no pool to help me tell\u2014",
    "so I look at them and look at them until",
    "one thing makes a mirror in my eyes",
    "then I paint it with the tear to make it bright.",
    "This is why I sit up through the night."

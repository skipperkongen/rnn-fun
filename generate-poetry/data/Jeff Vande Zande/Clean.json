    "Her small body shines",
    "with water and light.",
    "Giggling, she squeals \u201cdaddy,\u201d",
    "splashes until his pants darken.",
    "Five more minutes, he thinks,",
    "stepping out quickly,",
    "pouring himself a drink,",
    "not expecting to return",
    "to find her slipped under,",
    "her tiny face staring up",
    "through the undulating surface.",
    "Before he can move,",
    "or drop his scotch,",
    "she raises her dripping head,",
    "her mouth a perfect O.",
    "The sound of her gulped breath",
    "takes the wind out of him.",
    "Her face,",
    "pale and awed,",
    "understands the other side",
    "of water and air.",
    "His wife didn\u2019t see,",
    "doesn\u2019t know.",
    "Her feet pulse and fade",
    "in the upstairs joists.",
    "His daughter cries,",
    "slips from him, not giggling.",
    "She wants out.",
    "He tries to keep her",
    "in the tub, in the light.",
    "He\u2019s on his knees."

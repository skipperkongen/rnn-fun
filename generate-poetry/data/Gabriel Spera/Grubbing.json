    "The jay\u2019s up early, and attacks the lawn",
    "with something of that fervor and despair",
    "of one whose keys are not where they always are,",
    "checking the same spots over and again",
    "till something new or overlooked appears\u2014",
    "an armored pillbug, or a husk of grain.",
    "He flits with it home, where his mate beds down,",
    "her stern tail feathers jutting from the nest",
    "like a spoon handle from a breakfast bowl.",
    "The quickest lover\u2019s peck, and he\u2019s paroled",
    "again to stalk the sodgrass, cockheaded, obsessed.",
    "He must get something from his selfless work\u2014",
    "joy, or reprieve, or a satisfying sense",
    "of obligation dutifully dispensed.",
    "Unless, of course, he\u2019s just a bird, with beaks\u2014",
    "too many beaks\u2014to fill, in no way possessed",
    "of traits or demons humans might devise,",
    "his dark not filled with could-have-beens and whys."

    "or under, all from Manhattan, we loitered bare",
    "to the waist for the X-rays. In the whorling light",
    "from one rainy window, our shapes were mere",
    "outlines from floor to wall, opaque",
    "as plater, white, or terra-cotta, black . . .",
    "\u2018Names or numbers,\u2019 a skinny white girl with pale blue eyes",
    "shrugged her shoulders. \u2018Why come here at all? You think little Susan",
    "(thumb mockingly hooked at herself) needs working papers",
    "to work in my uncle\u2019s diner? If they\u2019d let me off school",
    "at noon now\u2014that\u2019s where the real tips are!\u2019",

    "The skinny girl just cackled, goospimpled arms",
    "huddled against her ribs. \u2018Whadda you two, work",
    "for the mayor? What\u2019s this (swinging her locker key",
    "with its scarred wooden number)\u2014the key to the city?\u2019",
    "She meant last week, when they\u2019d offered it",
    "to some visiting queen. Even I snickered. I",
    "was younger than most of them, homesick among the near-",
    "women\u2019s breasts and hair, even the familiar",
    "girls\u2019 cloakroom odors: perspiration, powder, decades",
    "of menstrual fust\u2014\u2018Well, I\u2019m coming back in six months.\u2019",

    "\u2018His name is Harold Curtis,\u2019 was all she answered, then \u2018It too strong",
    "for my parents. They see it too strong for them in the end.\u2019",
    "In our silence, the gutter slurred strangely. And for just one",
    "moment, everyone breathless, the atmosphere grew",
    "almost tender. But nobody knew what to say",

    "Now each girl tilts her face down, contemplating",
    "her own unseen choices, real",
    "tips, the solitary and common",
    "square foot of imaginary chance . . . Outside, the rain",
    "was letting up. The city, like a graph",
    "of its own mountainous causes, climbed in a mist",
    "across our window. And then the matron came, calling",
    "our locker numbers, one by one, for the X-rays.",
    "\u2018Jesus, it\u2019s late.\u2019 \u2018Hey honey, I\u2019m ready!\u2019 \u2018Where\u2019d we change",
    "at from the D Train?\u2019 Through the clearing air on the far",
    "side of City Hall Park, I could see a narrow street",
    "and a streetsign: Broadway. Miles to the north",
    "my street had a number, and Broadway was really broad.",
    "In the concrete prows of islands, the innumerable old women",
    "were sitting, lonely as soldiers, silent as . . .",
    "\u2018What\u2019s up, girl? Goose step on your grave?\u2019",
    "Another number. And now, the room darker, each girl",
    "cast about for the cheering word, when \u2018Listen,\u2019 I suddenly",
    "heard my own voice saying, \u2018Guess what I saw coming down? A street",
    "called Anne Street.\u2019\u2014\u2018So what?\u2019\u2014\u2018So my name is Anne.\u2019",
    "A pause, then \u2018Hey kid, that\u2019s really funny!\u2019 They all",
    "grinned, and one of the older girls gave my shoulder",
    "a tolerant punch. I was one of the youngest, and as far",
    "as I can remember, that was all that I said."

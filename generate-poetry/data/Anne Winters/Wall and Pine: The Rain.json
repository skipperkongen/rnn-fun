    "Now the god of rainy August hangs his mask",
    "among the city\u2019s spires and balustrades",
    "and stone clocktowers half-effaced in clouds.",
    "On Park the first reflecting pool dims",
    "with a thousand smelted-silver circle-rims,",
    "while west on Fifth a modiste scatters leaves",
    "in fall vitrines, and felt-browed mannequins",
    "resign the world with gestures of disdain.",
    "Now in the Cloister\u2019s high parterres the rain",
    "floods copper gutterings, boxwood, terraced urns",
    "and mottoes. \u201cThe weather turns.\u201d Clamped to their pier,",
    "the smiling Gaul, the murderer Clotaire,",
    "and Isaiah, green-throned, water-cowled, exchange",
    "their fine-lit ironies for rotes of pain."

    "After three months, Virginia is still a frontier.",
    "Late at night, I close the door",
    "on my husband practicing Mozart, the dishpan fills",
    "and the network affiliates sign off one by one.",
    "Now the country stations, tuning up like crickets",
    "on radios in scattered valley kitchens:",
    "(Wanting to say \u2018I\u2019m real fine\u2019 I whisper \u2018Wow.\u2019)",
    "An army",
    "of women, straightened and ironed and blued",
    "like Picasso\u2019s ironer\u2014jerking coffeecups",
    "back with one gesture, hips pressed to sinks.",
    "Their suspendered husbands are reading\u2014the paper? the Bible?",
    "And it\u2019s",
    ", till midnight\u2014the anthem\u2014",
    "and one soaped hand jerks out, and their lighted lives recede",
    "to kitchens on the moon\u2019s dark side, Mozart rising . . .",
    "Daytimes, in post office, gas station, greasy spoon,",
    "I don\u2019t see them anywhere, it makes me nervous.",
    "Black faces down here look \u201ccolored.\u201d",
    "I am afraid of the other, red faces.",
    "Take my first job in Boston,",
    "the outgoing typist said, \u2018You\u2019ve got",
    "to know the foms, we use so many foms.\u2019",
    "And I said",
    "I thought law firms had",
    "A tort, I thought, was like",
    "But I was wrong about the farms,",
    "and after the Cardinal\u2019s Vietnam speech",
    "one of the girls said, \u2018Think you\u2019re smat with that accent?\u2019",
    "Still, nothing soothes me, sometimes,",
    "like American voices, softened with distance,",
    "with nearness, as murmurs in a darkened Greyhound:",
    "\u2018It sure has been a scorcher.\u2019 \u2018Where you folks from?\u2019",
    "I keep yawning, lightworlds off in the dark . . .",
    "Sometimes my lonesome standard English sleeps:",
    "and the voices of Earth and Moon swell in my helmet",
    "with prairie inflections, soft twangs of outer speech\u2014",
    "\u2018You\u2019re looking real good,\u2019 says Earth",
    "\u2018\u2014ain\u2019t that somethin\u2019?\u2019",

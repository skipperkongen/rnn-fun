    "When my devotions could not pierce",
    "Thy silent ears,",
    "Then was my heart broken, as was my verse;",
    "My breast was full of fears",
    "And disorder.",
    "My bent thoughts, like a brittle bow,",
    "Did fly asunder:",
    "Each took his way; some would to pleasures go,",
    "Some to the wars and thunder",
    "Of alarms.",
    "\u201cAs good go anywhere,\u201d they say,",
    "\u201cAs to benumb",
    "Both knees and heart, in crying night and day,",
    "But no hearing.\u201d",
    "O that thou shouldst give dust a tongue",
    "To cry to thee,",
    "And then not hear it crying! All day long",
    "My heart was in my knee,",
    "But no hearing.",
    "Therefore my soul lay out of sight,",
    "Untuned, unstrung:",
    "My feeble spirit, unable to look right,",
    "Like a nipped blossom, hung",
    "Discontented.",
    "O cheer and tune my heartless breast,",
    "Defer no time;",
    "That so thy favors granting my request,",
    "They and my mind may chime,",
    "And mend my rhyme."

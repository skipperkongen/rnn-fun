    "A broken ALTAR, Lord, thy servant rears,",
    "Made of a heart and cemented with tears;",
    "Whose parts are as thy hand did frame;",
    "No workman's tool hath touch'd the same.",
    "A HEART alone",
    "Is such a stone,",
    "As nothing but",
    "Thy pow'r doth cut.",
    "Wherefore each part",
    "Of my hard heart",
    "Meets in this frame",
    "To praise thy name.",
    "That if I chance to hold my peace,",
    "These stones to praise thee may not cease.",
    "Oh, let thy blessed SACRIFICE be mine,",
    "And sanctify this ALTAR to be thine."

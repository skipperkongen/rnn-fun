    "Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store,",

    "With thee",
    "O let me rise",
    "As larks, harmoniously,",
    "And sing this day thy victories:",
    "Then shall the fall further the flight in me.",
    "My tender age in sorrow did beginne",
    "And still with sicknesses and shame.",
    "Thou didst so punish sinne,",
    "That I became",
    "Most thinne.",
    "With thee",
    "Let me combine,",
    "And feel thy victorie:",
    "For, if I imp my wing on thine,",
    "Affliction shall advance the flight in me."

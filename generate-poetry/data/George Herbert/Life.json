    "I made a posy, while the day ran by:",
    "\u201cHere will I smell my remnant out, and tie",
    "My life within this band.\u201d",
    "But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they",
    "By noon most cunningly did steal away,",
    "And withered in my hand.",
    "My hand was next to them, and then my heart;",
    "I took, without more thinking, in good part",
    "Time\u2019s gentle admonition;",
    "Who did so sweetly death\u2019s sad taste convey,",
    "Making my mind to smell my fatal day,",
    "Yet, sug\u2019ring the suspicion.",
    "Farewell dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent,",
    "Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament,",
    "And after death for cures.",
    "I follow straight without complaints or grief,",
    "Since, if my scent be good, I care not if",
    "It be as short as yours."

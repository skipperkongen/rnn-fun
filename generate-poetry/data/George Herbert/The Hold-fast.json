    "I threaten'd to observe the strict decree",
    "Of my dear God with all my power and might;",
    "But I was told by one it could not be;",
    "Yet I might trust in God to be my light.",
    "\"Then will I trust,\" said I, \"in Him alone.\"",
    "\"Nay, e'en to trust in Him was also His:",
    "We must confess that nothing is our own.\"",
    "\"Then I confess that He my succour is.\"",
    "\"But to have nought is ours, not to confess",
    "That we have nought.\" I stood amaz'd at this,",
    "Much troubled, till I heard a friend express",
    "That all things were more ours by being His;",
    "What Adam had, and forfeited for all,",
    "Christ keepeth now, who cannot fail or fall."

    "Having been tenant long to a rich lord,",
    "Not thriving, I resolv\u00e8d to be bold,",
    "And make a suit unto him, to afford",
    "A new small-rented lease, and cancel th\u2019 old.",
    "In heaven at his manor I him sought;",
    "They told me there that he was lately gone",
    "About some land, which he had dearly bought",
    "Long since on earth, to take possessi\u00f2n.",
    "I straight returned, and knowing his great birth,",
    "Sought him accordingly in great resorts;",
    "In cities, theaters, gardens, parks, and courts;",
    "At length I heard a ragged noise and mirth",
    "Of thieves and murderers; there I him espied,",
    "Who straight,",
    "said, and died."

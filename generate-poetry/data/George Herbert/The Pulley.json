    "When God at first made man,",
    "Having a glass of blessings standing by,",
    "\u201cLet us,\u201d said he, \u201cpour on him all we can.",
    "Let the world\u2019s riches, which dispers\u00e8d lie,",
    "Contract into a span.\u201d",
    "So strength first made a way;",
    "Then beauty flowed, then wisdom, honour, pleasure.",
    "When almost all was out, God made a stay,",
    "Perceiving that, alone of all his treasure,",
    "Rest in the bottom lay.",
    "\u201cFor if I should,\u201d said he,",
    "\u201cBestow this jewel also on my creature,",
    "He would adore my gifts instead of me,",
    "And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature;",
    "So both should losers be.",
    "\u201cYet let him keep the rest,",
    "But keep them with repining restlessness;",
    "Let him be rich and weary, that at least,",
    "If goodness lead him not, yet weariness",
    "May toss him to my breast.\u201d"

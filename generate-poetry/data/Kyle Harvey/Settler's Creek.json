    "You\u2019d been gone four months by then,",
    "but we brought you along anyway.",
    "On my back, you rested",
    "riding inside a wooden box.",
    "The idea was to lay you gently",
    "at the water\u2019s surface,",
    "but our clumsy hands spilled you,",
    "and it was hard to tell whether you went head",
    "or feet first, but it didn\u2019t much matter",
    "anyway, I suppose.",
    "You would float on down the creek",
    "until you had reached the next and so on.",
    "My father gave a little wave and joked,",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ll see you back on down in Denver, Dad.\u201d",
    "We stood there in silence",
    "listening to you chuckle",
    "under the bridge and over",
    "the first set of riffles downstream."

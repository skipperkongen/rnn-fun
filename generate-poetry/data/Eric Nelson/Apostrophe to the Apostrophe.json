    "Small floater, you stay above the fray,",
    "a wink at nothing's nod, a raised brow",
    "watching p's and q's, a selfless mote",
    "between I and m, a little horn of plenty",
    "spilling plurals, disdaining the bottom line.",
    "Unlike your twin relatives\u2014groupies of wit",
    "and wisdom, hangers on in the smallest talk\u2014",
    "you work alone, dark of a crescent moon.",
    "Laboring in obscurity, you never ask why,",
    "never exclaim, never tell anyone where to go.",
    "Caught up between extremes, you are both",
    "a turning away and a stepping forth,",
    "a loss and an addition. You are the urge",
    "to possess everything, and the sure sign",
    "that something is missing."

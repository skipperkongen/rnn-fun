    "To live and not be Thine Own,",
    "Like Springtime is when birds are flown;",
    "Or liberty in prison bars,",
    "Or evening skies without the stars;",
    "Like diamonds that are lusterless,",
    "Or rest when there\u2019s no weariness;",
    "Like lovely flower that have no scent,",
    "Or music when the sound is spent."

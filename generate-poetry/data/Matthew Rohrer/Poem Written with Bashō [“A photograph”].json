    "A photograph",
    "on the back of a hand mirror",
    "resembles someone you knew",
    "who sang themselves utterly away.",
    "It cannot touch you",
    "or the sound of the rapids.",
    "Leave it, and walk farther",
    "crawling up my leg",
    "to find me all smiles",
    "attached to nothing.",
    "You and I can stay",
    "in the morning dew.",
    "My little telephone",
    "in the mulberry fields",
    "going unanswered",
    "on that blade of grass."

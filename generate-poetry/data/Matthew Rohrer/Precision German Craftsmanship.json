    "It was a good day and I was about to do something important",
    "and good, but then I unscrewed the pen I was using",
    "to see the ink. Precision German craftsmanship.",
    "The Germans are so persnickety and precise,",
    "they wash their driveways. Their mountains and streams",
    "dance around each other in a clockwork, courtly imitation",
    "of spring. They build the Panzer tank, out of rakes",
    "hoses and garden gnomes; they built me.",
    "And I\u2019ve seated myself above an avenue on the brink",
    "of mystery, always just on the lip, with my toes over the lip",
    "but my bowels behind.",
    "When I replaced the ink the sky was socked in,",
    "only one window of blue open in the north, directly over someone.",
    "But that person was reading about Rosicrucians in the laundromat,",
    "he was unaware as the blue window closed above him.",
    "The rest of us are limp and damp,",
    "I see a button in front of us that says \u201cspin cycle.\u201d",
    "I\u2019m going to push it."

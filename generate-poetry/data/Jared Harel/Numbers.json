    "My grandmother never trusted calculators.",
    "She would crunch numbers in a spiral notebook",
    "at the kitchen table, watching her news.",
    "she\u2019d snap at my father. And so my father worked",
    "harder, fixed more mufflers, gave her receipts",
    "but the numbers seldom changed.",
    "There were silky things my mother wanted,",
    "glorious dinners we could not afford.",
    "Grandma would lecture her:",
    "and so our house was clean. The attic spotless.",
    "In fact, it wasn\u2019t until after she died",
    "that my parents found out how much she had saved us.",
    "What hidden riches had been kept in those notebooks,",
    "invested in bonds, solid blue digits",
    "etched on each page. She left them",
    "in the kitchen by her black and white television",
    "we tossed a week later, though it seemed to work fine."

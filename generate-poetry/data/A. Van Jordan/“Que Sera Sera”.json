    "and I\u2019m a little boy again, listening",
    "to Sly and his Family covering Doris\u2019s hit,",
    "driving down I-40;",
    "a cop pulls me over to ask why",
    "I\u2019m here, in his town, with my Yankee tags.",

    "while taking cover within your flesh,",
    "even at the risk of losing",
    "what some would call a melody;",
    "I call it the sound of home.",
    "Like when a song gets so far out",
    "on a solo you almost don\u2019t recognize it,",
    "but then you get back to the hook, you suddenly",
    "recognize the tune and before you know it,",
    "you\u2019re putting your hands together; you\u2019re on your feet\u2014",

    "or neighborhood dogs bite those not from your neigborhood",
    "and someone with some sense says Down, Boy,",
    "or you hope someone has some sense",

    "And it\u2019s rust you need to remember",
    "when the cop asks, What kind of work you do?",
    "It\u2019s rust you need to remember: the smell",
    "of summer rain on the sidewalk",
    "and the patina on wrought-iron railings on your front porch",
    "with rust patches on them, and the smell",
    "of fresh mowed grass and gasoline and sweat",
    "of your childhood as he takes a step back",
    "when you tell him you\u2019re a poet teaching",
    "English down the road at the college,",
    "when he takes a step back\u2014",
    "to assure you, know, that this has nothing to do with race,",
    "but the rust of a community he believes",
    "he keeps safe, and he says Have a Good One,",
    "meaning day as he swaggers back to his car,",
    "and the color of the day and the face behind sunglasses",

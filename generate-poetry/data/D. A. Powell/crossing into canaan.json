    "febrile body I woke into: nightsweats, stink of the toil of living:",
    "where hands could not bear to approach me, the young man fingered",
    "lay upon me, was himself a cool sponge, drew my perspiration to his lips",
    "ice-chips he held in his teeth, he pushed small bergs into my mouth",
    "caressed the skeletal arms I\u2019ve hidden in long sleeves",
    "kissed neck and chest, belly rotten with pudgy organs, thick-set flesh",
    "he pressed against me, cock on cock and tongue against tongue",
    "saw his reflection in my marshy eyes and did not flinch such weakness",
    "held, sustained by this capable stroke, boatswain of my crossing",
    "I take the death I\u2019m moored to, announced as a measureless promontory",
    "and bob in the river like a bloated corpse, blue lips, vacant gaze",
    "I let the water fill my lungs until they rip their festive pi\u00f1atas",
    "because the one who comes to gather me, capricious angel",
    "has a voice that affirms me rising when this fever abates"

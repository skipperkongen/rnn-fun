    "Where we could be boys together. This region of want:",
    "the campestrial flat. The adolescents roving across the plat.",
    "Come hither. He-of-the-hard would call me hither.",
    "Sheer abdomen, sheer slickensides, the feldspar buttes",
    "that mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust.",
    "And I could kiss his tits and he could destroy me",
    "on the inflorescent slopes; in his darkest dingles;",
    "upon the grassland\u2019s raffish plaits. And he could roll me",
    "in coyote brush: I who was banished to the barren",
    "could come back into his fold, and I",
    "would let him lay me down on the cold, cold ground.",
    "Clouds, above, lenticular, the spreading fundament,",
    "a glorious breech among the thunderheads",
    "and in their midst, a great white heron magnifies",
    "the day. We\u2019d keep together, he and I,",
    "and we\u2019d gain meaning from our boyage; we\u2019d pursue",
    "each other through the crush of darkling rifts.",
    "Climb into each other\u2019s precipitous coombes.",
    "Where would it end, this brush and bush, this brome",
    "and blazing star? There is always some new way",
    "to flex a limb and find its secret drupe.",
    "Not only the hope of nature; the nature of hope:",
    "so long as culverts carry us, so long as we stay ripe",
    "to one another\u2019s lips, and welcoming to hands,",
    "as long as we extend our spans, to tangle them,",
    "as spinning insects do their glistered floss.",
    "This is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen.",
    "Rather: the trumpet\u2019s bell is but a prelude.",
    "It says we all are beautiful at least once.",
    "And, if you\u2019d watch over me, we can be beautiful again."

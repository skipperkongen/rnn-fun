    "listen mother, he punched the air: I am not your son dying",
    "the day fades and the starlings roost: a body\u2019s a husk a nest of goodbye",
    "his wrist colorless and soft was not a stick of chewing gum",
    "how tell? well a plastic bracelet with his name for one. & no mint",
    "his eyes distinguishable from oysters how? only when pried open",
    "she at times felt the needle going in. felt her own sides cave. she rasped",
    "she twitched with a palsy: tectonic plates grumbled under her feet",
    "soiled his sheets clogged the yellow BIOHAZARD bin: later to be burned",
    "soot clouds billowed out over the city: a stole. a pillbox hat [smart city]",
    "and wouldn\u2019t the taxis stop now. and wouldn\u2019t a hush smother us all",
    "the vascular walls graffitied and scarred. a clotted rend in the muscle",
    "wend through the avenues throttled t-cells. processional staph & thrush",
    "the scourge the spike a stab a shending bile the grace the quenching",
    "mother who brought me here, muddler: open the window. let birds in"

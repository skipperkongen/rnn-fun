    "What\u2019s left of my battles and my turmoil",
    "is in my seaside cabin: this roiling air.",
    "And yet it\u2019s what\u2019s outside that makes me shiver.",
    "Not the ocean coldness \u2014 something heavier.",
    "Hot black tea might help \u2014 it revives.",
    "Two kinds of glass are at hand for my thirst:",
    "that windowpane, this tumbler for my tea.",
    "If I stare through the faceted clear sides",
    "of the second at the first,",
    "I\u2019ll see the darkness squinting back at me.",
    "I can\u2019t deny that even though my eye \u2014",
    "clairvoyant as a crystal ball \u2014 clinks like it can see",
    "something, I don\u2019t know what comes next ...",
    "(Zek \u2014 zek \u2014 whetstones on knives ...",
    "a nickering ... Here comes a horse, it whinnies",
    "and the rider \u2014 Stick him!, thieves shout",
    "as they leap down from a tree and stab,",
    "then they lead the horse away",
    "down the long snowbound shore.)",
    "Windswept snow and sand are sorrel: tea leaves",
    "scalded by sunset. Sea foam rushes up these shores",
    "to decorate some fir trees but not others.",
    "And on the withers of a wave",
    "a gull-equestrian comes riding in \u2014",
    "Haie! Here they both are!",
    "Snow explodes like sugar",
    "that someone is stabbing with a spoon",
    "in a glass of chai.",
    "And the tea-air sweetens, the snow-sand dissolves,",
    "the light of it switched off, spent, an omen:",
    "now look \u2014 from deep within the firmament",
    "Time has bobbed up like the moon:",
    "the clock face of a slice of lemon.",
    "I clink the teaspoon in the glass \u2014 what\u2019s that about?",
    "And even though each hourly radius",
    "of the lemon slice is fixed in the white rind,",
    "between these translucencies pressed pulp spills out.",
    "Like lime or lemon, the taste of Time is sour \u2014",
    "and yet it has no odor, color, hour.",
    "My clinking teaspoon\u2019s yet another of",
    "my self-delusions, since it\u2019s only the glass",
    "that answers it, and Time",
    "says nothing in reply \u2014 like all the other governings",
    "that invite us to believe",
    "they have their power over us.",
    "In every object, quick or dead, there\u2019s Time,",
    "yet Time itself is unaware of Time \u2014",
    "the way a gull (such a polyglot",
    "of fish-tongues), soaring in the dark,",
    "unknowingly glows at ten to two,",
    "her wings the phosphorescent hands of a clock.",
    "No people in this region. But \u2014 do people",
    "exist at all? And the so-called base and superstructure",
    "get, at best, a grade of C (in Russian, \u201cthree,\u201d",
    "troika \u2014 a kind of carriage \u2014 in which the Uriah Heeps",
    "are riding toward our \u201cbright new future\u201d ... ).",
    "Oh, plenty of hearty pink-faced people (gray-faced, too)",
    "here ... but are they that real? There\u2019s only sea and tides",
    "and more of the same. Sea air throws bombast",
    "at my cabin and makes it talk.",
    "My window\u2019s blinded by a heavy foamy sea-pulp blast.",
    "At the bottom of my tea glass \u2014 sweetest sweet.",
    "But sugar specks are stuck to the sides,",
    "scarcely rinsed by waves of tea,",
    "whether attacked or not by my spoon.",
    "Now come the many stars that the sky is, or was \u2014",
    "like the American flag on the moon \u2014",
    "but under such a sky, who feels he needs",
    "Kant\u2019s categorical imperative?",
    "So Time is always empty, a negative,",
    "and doesn\u2019t bother us",
    "the way this landscape does.",
    "I could have sparkled like a Cicero!",
    "But even out here all words are turned into a game",
    "of ping-pong, which makes my silenced brain",
    "come bubbling out my throat \u2014 it\u2019s just one more white foam ...",
    "And only an insatiable gull\u2019s scream of dissent",
    "marks this deaf land not as the island of a castaway",
    "but as a massive continent."

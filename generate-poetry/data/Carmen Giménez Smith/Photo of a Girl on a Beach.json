    "Once when I was harmless",
    "and didn\u2019t know any better,",
    "a mirror to the front of me",
    "and an ocean behind,",
    "I lay wedged in the middle of daylight,",
    "paper-doll thin, dreaming,",
    "then I vanished. I gave the day a fingerprint,",
    "then forgot.",
    "I sat naked on a towel",
    "on a hot June Monday.",
    "The sun etched the inside of my eyelids,",
    "while a boy dozed at my side.",
    "The smell of all oceans was around us\u2014",
    "steamy salt, shell, and sweat,",
    "but I reached for the distant one.",
    "A tide rose while I slept,",
    "and soon I was alone. Try being",
    "a figure in memory. It\u2019s hollow there.",
    "For truth\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll say she was on a beach",
    "and her eyes were closed.",
    "She was bare in the sand, long,",
    "and the hour took her bit by bit."

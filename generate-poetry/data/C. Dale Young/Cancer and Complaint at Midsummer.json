    "Because the silence of the dead,",
    "that blue expanse of sky about",
    "to ashen here above my head,",
    "is easily ignored, our tears",
    "are blamed on flowers whitening limbs",
    "of trees, the very air, with hymns",
    "of summer pollen no one hears",
    "except for women\u2014old, devout.",
    "And now, these humid months, dispute",
    "them not: midsummer has no name",
    "among the dead, no Latin root",
    "to which it can be traced, no swarm",
    "of conjugations to decipher.",
    "So little left to write this summer,",
    "my mind now weak in handling form,",
    "which I still cling to just the same."

    "As if the sky during its emergence",
    "\u2014when it bubbled its way up out of the sand,",
    "cooled and then sublimed into vapor",
    "that blued the dank grey of the atmosphere\u2014",
    "left a residue of cobalt behind to remind",
    "from where it had sprung into existence,",
    "the water rising from this spring",
    "appears unearthly, as only things",
    "close to earth, born of earth, can:",
    "its blue deeper than the heart of a sapphire.",
    "Today, when faced with such a spectacle,",
    "we have, as usual, only two choices:",
    "the paralysis of awe, or the quick nonchalance",
    "of acceptance. But what about the Spaniards",
    "who came upon this spring before there was",
    "a platform lined with inner tubes, before",
    "there were wooden walkways elevated to slow",
    "their impending rot, before their was a faux beach,",
    "its sand stolen from the spring\u2019s center?",
    "Did they run in with their clothes on",
    "convinced that this was",
    "fountain of youth?",
    "Did they laugh believing themselves",
    "drunk, mad, asleep\u2014dead, maybe?",
    "That afternoon, late summer, we did not swim,",
    "chose instead to wander out to the edge",
    "of the walkway, not a word between the two of us,",
    "only the wind. Unlike us mere mortals, the trees",
    "had long since been impressed,",
    "preferring, instead, to maintain postures",
    "incompatible with the work of sycophants."

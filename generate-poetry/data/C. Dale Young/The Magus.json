    "The pearls, mere reminders.",
    "The ocean\u2019s rapid recoil, a signal.",
    "The gulls appeared enormous",
    "in that way only things from above can\u2014",
    "such is presentation of the sudden.",
    "If only this were worthy of a frame,",
    "the wooden gesture announcing",
    "a moment past were cherished.",
    "But it was too late for that, too late",
    "to answer the surf\u2019s anxious",
    "too late to decline the continuous life",
    "he had resigned himself, turning",
    "away from the grave, that plot",
    "being too familiar to so many.",
    "Of course immortality had its price:",
    "first his staff he had taped back together,",
    "then the sleeves of his robe",
    "he had reclaimed from the depths, then",
    "the magic leached nightly from his fingertips",
    "so that now his incantation for a storm",
    "brought only a slight breeze,",
    "a quick sun shower that frightened",
    "only the flowers struggling in the salt air.",
    "Now, showing his centuries, he insists:",
    "These are my hands that gnarled though they be",
    "when lifted to the sky bring rain."

    "My father had our yard cemented over.",
    "He couldn\u2019t tell a flower from a weed.",
    "The neighbors let their backyards run to clover",
    "and some grew dappled gardens from a seed,",
    "but he preferred cement to rampant green.",
    "Lushness reeked of anarchy\u2019s profusion.",
    "Better to tamp the wildness down, unseen,",
    "than tolerate its careless brash intrusion.",
    "The grass interred, he felt well satisfied:",
    "his first house, and he took an owner\u2019s pride,",
    "surveying the uniform, cemented yard.",
    "Just so, he labored to cement his heart."

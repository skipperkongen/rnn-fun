    "Here lies, whom hound did ne\u2019er pursue,",
    "Nor swifter greyhound follow,",
    "Whose foot ne\u2019er tainted morning dew,",
    "Nor ear heard huntsman\u2019s hallo\u2019,",
    "Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,",
    "Who, nursed with tender care,",
    "And to domesticate bounds confined,",
    "Was still a wild jack-hare.",
    "Though duly from my hand he took",
    "His pittance every night,",
    "He did it with a jealous look,",
    "And, when he could, would bite.",
    "His diet was of wheaten bread,",
    "And milk, and oats, and straw,",
    "Thistles, or lettuces instead,",
    "With sand to scour his maw.",
    "On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,",
    "On pippins\u2019 russet peel;",
    "And, when his juicy salads failed,",
    "Sliced carrot pleased him well.",
    "A Turkey carpet was his lawn,",
    "Whereon he loved to bound,",
    "To skip and gambol like a fawn,",
    "And swing his rump around.",
    "His frisking was at evening hours,",
    "For then he lost his fear;",
    "But most before approaching showers,",
    "Or when a storm drew near.",
    "Eight years and five round-rolling moons",
    "He thus saw steal away,",
    "Dozing out all his idle noons,",
    "And every night at play.",
    "I kept him for his humor\u2019s sake,",
    "For he would oft beguile",
    "My heart of thoughts that made it ache,",
    "And force me to a smile.",
    "But now, beneath this walnut-shade",
    "He finds his long, last home,",
    "And waits in snug concealment laid,",
    "Till gentler Puss shall come.",
    "He, still more ag\u00e8d, feels the shocks",
    "From which no care can save,",
    "And, partner once of Tiney\u2019s box,",
    "Must soon partake his grave."

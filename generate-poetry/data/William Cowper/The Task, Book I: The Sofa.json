    "Thou know\u2019st my praise of nature most sincere,",
    "And that my raptures are not conjur\u2019d up",
    "To serve occasions of poetic pomp,",
    "But genuine, and art partner of them all.",
    "How oft upon yon eminence our pace",
    "Has slacken\u2019d to a pause, and we have borne",
    "The ruffling wind, scarce conscious that it blew,",
    "While admiration, feeding at the eye,",
    "And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene.",
    "Thence with what pleasure have we just discern\u2019d",
    "The distant plough slow-moving, and beside",
    "His lab\u2019ring team, that swerv\u2019d not from the track,",
    "The sturdy swain diminish\u2019d to a boy!",
    "Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain",
    "Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o\u2019er,",
    "Conducts the eye along its sinuous course",
    "Delighted. There, fast rooted in his bank,",
    "Stand, never overlook\u2019d, our fav\u2019rite elms,",
    "That screen the herdsman\u2019s solitary hut;",
    "While far beyond, and overthwart the stream",
    "That as with molten glass inlays the vale,",
    "The sloping land recedes into the clouds;",
    "Displaying on its varied side the grace",
    "Of hedge-row beauties numberless, square tow\u2019r,",
    "Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells",
    "Just undulates upon the list\u2019ning ear,",
    "Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.",
    "Scenes must be beautiful which daily view\u2019d",
    "Please daily, and whose novelty survives",
    "Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years.",
    "Praise justly due to those that I describe.",
    ". . .",
    "But though true worth and virtue, in the mild",
    "And genial soil of cultivated life",
    "Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there,",
    "Yet not in cities oft. In proud and gay",
    "And gain-devoted cities; thither flow,",
    "As to a common and most noisome sewer,",
    "The dregs and f\u00e6culence of ev\u2019ry land.",
    "In cities foul example on most minds",
    "Begets its likeness. Rank abundance breeds",
    "In gross and pamper\u2019d cities sloth and lust,",
    "And wantonness and gluttonous excess.",
    "In cities, vice is hidden with most ease,",
    "Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught",
    "By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there",
    "Beyond th\u2019 atchievement of successful flight.",
    "I do confess them nurs\u2019ries of the arts,",
    "In which they flourish most: where, in the beams",
    "Of warm encouragement, and in the eye",
    "Of public note, they reach their perfect size.",
    "Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaim\u2019d",
    "The fairest capital of all the world,",
    "By riot and incontinence the worst.",
    "There, touch\u2019d by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes",
    "A lucid mirror, in which Nature sees",
    "All her reflected features. Bacon there",
    "Gives more than female beauty to a stone,",
    "And Chatham\u2019s eloquence to marble lips.",
    ". . .",
    "God made the country, and man made the town:",
    "What wonder then, that health and virtue, gifts",
    "That can alone make sweet the bitter draught",
    "That life holds out to all, should most abound",
    "And least be threaten\u2019d in the fields and groves?",
    "Possess ye therefore, ye who, borne about",
    "In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue",
    "But that of idleness, and taste no scenes",
    "But such as art contrives, possess ye still",
    "Your element; there only ye can shine,",
    "There only minds like yours can do no harm.",
    "Our groves were planted to console at noon",
    "The pensive wand\u2019rer in their shades. At eve",
    "The moon-beam, sliding softly in between",
    "The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish,",
    "Birds warbling all the music. We can spare",
    "The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse",
    "Our softer satellite. Your songs confound",
    "Our more harmonious notes: the thrush departs",
    "Scar\u2019d, and th\u2019 offended nightingale is mute.",
    "There is a public mischief in your mirth,",
    "It plagues your country. Folly such as your\u2019s,",
    "Grac\u2019d with a sword, and worthier of a fan,",
    "Has made, which enemies could ne\u2019er have done,",
    "Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you,",
    "A mutilated structure, soon to fall."

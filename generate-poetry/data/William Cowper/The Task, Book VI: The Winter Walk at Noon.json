    "Thus heav\u2019n-ward all things tend. For all were once",
    "Perfect, and all must be at length restor\u2019d.",
    "So God has greatly purpos\u2019d; who would else",
    "In his dishonour\u2019d works himself endure",
    "Dishonour, and be wrong\u2019d without redress.",
    "Haste then, and wheel away a shatter\u2019d world,",
    "Ye slow-revolving seasons! we would see,",
    "(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet)",
    "A world that does not dread and hate his laws,",
    "And suffer for its crime; would learn how fair",
    "The creature is that God pronounces good,",
    "How pleasant in itself what pleases him.",
    "Here ev\u2019ry drop of honey hides a sting,",
    "Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flow\u2019rs,",
    "And ev\u2019n the joy that haply some poor heart",
    "Derives from heav\u2019n, pure as the fountain",
    "Is sully\u2019d in the stream; taking a taint",
    "From touch of human lips, at best impure.",
    "Oh for a world in principle as chaste",
    "As this is gross and selfish! over which",
    "Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway,",
    "That govern all things here, should\u2019ring aside",
    "The meek and modest truth, and forcing her",
    "To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife",
    "In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men:",
    "Where violence shall never lift the sword,",
    "Nor cunning justify the proud man\u2019s wrong,",
    "Leaving the poor no remedy but tears:",
    "Where he that fills an office, shall esteem",
    "Th\u2019 occasion it presents of doing good",
    "More than the perquisite: Where law shall speak",
    "Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts",
    "And equity; not jealous more to guard",
    "A worthless form, than to decide aright:",
    "Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse,",
    "Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace)",
    "With lean performance ape the work of love.",
    ". . .",
    "He is the happy man, whose life ev\u2019n now",
    "Shows somewhat of that happier life to come;",
    "Who, doom\u2019d to an obscure but tranquil state,",
    "Is pleas\u2019d with it, and, were he free to chuse,",
    "Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit",
    "Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,",
    "Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one",
    "Content indeed to sojourn while he must",
    "Below the skies, but having there his home.",
    "The world o\u2019erlooks him in her busy search",
    "Of objects more illustrious in her view;",
    "And, occupy\u2019d as earnestly as she,",
    "Though more sublimely, he o\u2019erlooks the world.",
    "She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;",
    "He seeks not hers, for he has prov\u2019d them vain.",
    "He cannot skim the ground like summer birds",
    "Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems",
    "Her honors, her emoluments, her joys.",
    "Therefore in contemplation is his bliss,",
    "Whose pow\u2019r is such, that whom she lifts from earth",
    "She makes familiar with a heav\u2019n unseen,",
    "And shows him glories yet to be reveal\u2019d.",
    ". . .",
    "So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,",
    "More golden than that age of fabled gold",
    "Renown\u2019d in ancient song; not vex\u2019d with care",
    "Or stain\u2019d with guilt, beneficent, approv\u2019d",
    "Of God and man, and peaceful in its end.",
    "So glide my life away! and so at last,",
    "My share of duties decently fulfill\u2019d,",
    "May some disease, not tardy to perform",
    "Its destin\u2019d office, yet with gentle stroke,",
    "Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat,",
    "Beneath a turf that I have often trod.",
    "It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when call\u2019d",
    "To dress a Sofa with the flow\u2019rs of verse,",
    "I play\u2019d awhile, obedient to the fair,",
    "With that light task; but soon, to please her more",
    "Whom flow\u2019rs alone I knew would little please,",
    "Let fall th\u2019 unfinish\u2019d wreath, and rov\u2019d for fruit;",
    "Rov\u2019d far, and gather\u2019d much: some harsh, \u2019tis true,",
    "Pick\u2019d from the thorns and briars of reproof,",
    "But wholesome, well-digested; grateful some",
    "To palates that can taste immortal truth,",
    "Insipid else, and sure to be despis\u2019d.",
    "But all is in his hand whose praise I seek.",
    "In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,",
    "If he regard not, though divine the theme.",
    "\u2019Tis not in artful measures, in the chime",
    "And idle tinkling of a minstrel\u2019s lyre,",
    "To charm his ear, whose eye is on the heart;",
    "Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,",
    "Whose approbation\u2014prosper even mine."

    "Hatred and vengeance, my eternal portion,",

    "Damned below Judas: more abhorred than he was,",
    "Who for a few pence sold his holy master.",
    "Twice betrayed, Jesus me, the last delinquent,",
    "Deems the profanest.",
    "Man disavows, and Delty disowns me:",
    "Hell might afford my miseries a shelter;",
    "Therefore hell keeps her ever-hungry mouths all",
    "Bolted against me.",
    "Hard lot! encompassed with a thousand dangers;",
    "Weary, faint, trembling with a thousand terrors,",
    "I\u2019m called, if vanquished, to receive a sentence",
    "Worse than Abiram\u2019s.",
    "Him the vindictive rod of angry justice",
    "Sent quick and howling to the centre headlong;",
    "I, fed with judgment, in a fleshly tomb, am",
    "Buried above ground."

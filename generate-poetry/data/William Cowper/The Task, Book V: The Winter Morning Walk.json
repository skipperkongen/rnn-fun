    "\u2019Tis morning; and the sun with ruddy orb",
    "Ascending, fires the horizon: while the clouds",
    "That crowd away before the driving wind,",
    "More ardent as the disk emerges more,",
    "Resemble most some city in a blaze,",
    "Seen through the leafless wood. His slanting ray",
    "Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale,",
    "And tinging all with his own rosy hue,",
    "From ev\u2019ry herb and ev\u2019ry spiry blade",
    "Stretches a length of shadow o\u2019er the field.",
    "Mine, spindling into longitude immense,",
    "In spite of gravity, and sage remark",
    "That I myself am but a fleeting shade,",
    "Provokes me to a smile. With eye askance",
    "I view the muscular proportion\u2019d limb",
    "Transform\u2019d to a lean shank. The shapeless pair,",
    "As they design\u2019d to mock me, at my side",
    "Take step for step; and as I near approach",
    "The cottage, walk along the plaster\u2019d wall,",
    "Prepost\u2019rous sight! the legs without the man.",
    "The verdure of the plain lies buried deep",
    "Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents,",
    "And coarser grass upspearing o\u2019er the rest,",
    "Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine",
    "Conspicuous, and in bright apparel clad,",
    "And fledg\u2019d with icy feathers, nod superb.",
    "The cattle mourn in corners where the fence",
    "Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep",
    "In unrecumbent sadness. There they wait",
    "Their wonted fodder; not like hung\u2019ring man",
    "Fretful if unsupply\u2019d, but silent, meek,",
    "And patient of the slow-pac\u2019d swain\u2019s delay.",
    "He from the stack carves out th\u2019 accustom\u2019d load,",
    "Deep-plunging, and again deep plunging oft",
    "His broad keen knife into the solid mass;",
    "Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,",
    "With such undeviating and even force",
    "He severs it away: no needless care",
    "Lest storms should overset the leaning pile",
    "Deciduous, or its own unbalanc\u2019d weight.",
    ". . .",
    "\u2019Tis liberty alone that gives the flow\u2019r",
    "Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,",
    "And we are weeds without it. All constraint,",
    "Except what wisdom lays on evil men,",
    "Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes",
    "Their progress in the road of science; blinds",
    "The eyesight of discov\u2019ry, and begets,",
    "In those that suffer it, a sordid mind",
    "Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit",
    "To be the tenant of man\u2019s noble form.",
    "Thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou art,",
    "With all thy loss of empire, and though squeez\u2019d",
    "By public exigence till annual food",
    "Fails for the craving hunger of the state,",
    "Thee I account still happy, and the chief",
    "Among the nations, seeing thou art free!",
    "My native nook of earth!",
    ". . .",
    "But there is yet a liberty unsung",
    "By poets, and by senators unprais\u2019d,",
    "Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the powers",
    "Of earth and hell confed\u2019rate take away.",
    "A liberty, which persecution, fraud,",
    "Oppression, prisons, have no pow\u2019r to bind,",
    "Which whoso tastes can be enslav\u2019d no more.",
    "\u2019Tis liberty of heart, deriv\u2019d from heav\u2019n,",
    "Bought with HIS blood who gave it to mankind,",
    "And seal\u2019d with the same token. It is held",
    "By charter, and that charter sanction\u2019d sure",
    "By th\u2019 unimpeachable and awful oath",
    "And promise of a God. His other gifts",
    "All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his,",
    "And are august, but this transcends them all."

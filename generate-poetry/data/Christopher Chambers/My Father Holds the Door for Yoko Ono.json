    "In New York City for a conference",
    "on weed control, leaving the hotel",
    "in a cluster of horticulturalists,",
    "he alone stops, midwestern, crewcut,",
    "narrow blue tie, cufflinks, wingtips,",
    "holds the door for the Asian woman",
    "in a miniskirt and thigh high",
    "white leather boots. She nods",
    "slightly, a sad and beautiful gesture.",
    "Neither smile, as if performing",
    "a timeless ritual, as if anticipating",
    "the loss of a son or a lover.",
    "Years later, Christmas, inexplicably",
    "he dons my mother\u2019s auburn wig,",
    "my brother\u2019s wire-rimmed glasses,",
    "and strikes a pose clowning",
    "with my second hand acoustic guitar.",
    "He is transformed, a working class hero",
    "and a door whispers shut,",
    "like cherry blossoms falling."

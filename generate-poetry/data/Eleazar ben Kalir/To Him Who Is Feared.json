    "To Him who is feared a Crown will I bring.",
    "Thrice Holy each day acclaim Him my King;",
    "At altars, ye mighty, proclaim loud His praise,",
    "And multitudes too may whisper His lays.",
    "Ye angels, ye men, whose good deeds He records\u2014",
    "Sing, He is One, His is good, our yoke is the Lord\u2019s!",
    "Praise Him trembling to-day, His mercy is wide\u2014",
    "Ye who fear for His wrath\u2014it doth not abide!",
    "Ye seraphim, high above storm clouds may sing;",
    "Men and angels make music, th\u2019 All-seeing is king.",
    "As ye open your lips, at His Name they shall cease\u2014",
    "Transgression and sin\u2014in their place shall be peace;",
    "And thrice shall the Shophar re-echo your song",
    "On mountain and altar to whom both belong."

    "On nights when the moon seems impenetrable\u2014",
    "a locked porthole to space;",
    "when the householder bars his windows",
    "and doors, and his dog lies until dawn,",
    "one jeweled eye open; when the maiden sleeps",
    "with her rosy knees sealed tightly together,",
    "on such nights the safecracker sets to work.",
    "Axe . . . Chisel . . . Nitroglycerin . . .",
    "Within the vault lie forty thousand",
    "tons of gold; the heaped up spoils",
    "of Ali Baba's cave; the secrets of the molecule.",
    "He sands his fingertips",
    "to feel the subtle vibrations",
    "of wheel lining up, just so, with wheel.",
    "His toolmarks are his fingerprints.",
    "And now a crack appears on the side",
    "of the egg, a single fault line,",
    "and within: the golden yolk just waiting.",
    "A kind of wind . . . a door flies open . . . a glitter",
    "of forsythia forced out of the branch.",
    "With smoothest fingertips you touch",
    "the locked cage of my ribs . . . just so.",
    "My knees fall open. And Cleopatra smiles,",
    "whose own Egyptians first invented the lock."

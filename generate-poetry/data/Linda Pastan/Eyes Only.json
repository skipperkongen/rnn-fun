    "Dear lost sharer",
    "of silences,",
    "I would send a letter",
    "the way the tree sends messages",
    "in leaves,",
    "or the sky in exclamations",
    "of pure cloud.",
    "Therefore I write",
    "in this blue",
    "ink, color",
    "of secret veins",
    "and arteries.",
    "It is morning here.",
    "Already the postman walks",
    "the innocent streets,",
    "dangerous as Aeolus",
    "with his bag of winds,",
    "or Hermes, the messenger,",
    "god of sleep and dreams",
    "who traces my image",
    "upon this stamp.",
    "In public buildings",
    "letters are weighed",
    "and sorted like meat;",
    "in railway stations",
    "huge sacks of mail",
    "are hidden like robbers' booty",
    "behind freight-car doors.",
    "And in another city",
    "the conjurer",
    "will hold a fan of letters",
    "before your outstretched hand\u2014",
    "\"Pick any card. . . \"",
    "You must tear the envelope",
    "as you would tear bread.",
    "Only then dark rivers",
    "of ink will thaw",
    "and flow",
    "under all the bridges",
    "we have failed",
    "to build",
    "between us."

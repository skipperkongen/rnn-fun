    "Mine, said the stone,",
    "mine is the hour.",
    "I crush the scissors,",
    "such is my power.",
    "Stronger than wishes,",
    "my power, alone.",
    "Mine, said the paper,",
    "mine are the words",
    "that smother the stone",
    "with imagined birds,",
    "reams of them, flown",
    "from the mind of the shaper.",
    "Mine, said the scissors,",
    "mine all the knives",
    "gashing through paper\u2019s",
    "ethereal lives;",
    "nothing\u2019s so proper",
    "as tattering wishes.",
    "As stone crushes scissors,",
    "as paper snuffs stone",
    "and scissors cut paper,",
    "all end alone.",
    "So heap up your paper",
    "and scissor your wishes",
    "and uproot the stone",
    "from the top of the hill.",
    "They all end alone",
    "as you will, you will."

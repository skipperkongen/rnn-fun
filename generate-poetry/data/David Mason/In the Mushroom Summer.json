    "Colorado turns Kyoto in a shower,",
    "mist in the pines so thick the crows delight",
    "(or seem to), winging in obscurity.",
    "The ineffectual panic of a squirrel",
    "who chattered at my passing gave me pause",
    "to watch his Ponderosa come and go\u2014",
    "long needles scratching cloud. I\u2019d summited",
    "but knew it only by the wildflower meadow,",
    "the muted harebells, paintbrush, gentian,",
    "scattered among the locoweed and sage.",
    "Today my grief abated like water soaking",
    "underground, its scar a little path",
    "of twigs and needles winding ahead of me",
    "downhill to the next bend. Today I let",
    "the rain soak through my shirt and was unharmed."

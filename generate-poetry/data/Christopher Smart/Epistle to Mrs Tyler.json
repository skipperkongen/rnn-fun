    "It ever was allow\u2019d, dear Madam,",
    "Ev\u2019n from the days of father Adam,",
    "Of all perfection flesh is heir to,",
    "Fair patience is the gentlest virtue;",
    "This is a truth our grandames teach,",
    "Our poets sing, and parsons preach;",
    "Yet after all, dear Moll, the fact is",
    "We seldom put it into practice;",
    "I\u2019ll warrant (if one knew the truth)",
    "You\u2019ve call\u2019d me many an idle youth,",
    "And styled me rude ungrateful bear,",
    "Enough to make a parson swear.",
    "I shall not make a long oration",
    "In order for my vindication,",
    "For what the plague can I say more",
    "Than lazy dogs have done before;",
    "Such stuff is nought but mere tautology,",
    "And so take that for my apology.",
    "First then for custards, my dear Mary,",
    "The produce of your dainty dairy,",
    "For stew\u2019d, for bak\u2019d, for boil\u2019d, for roast,",
    "And all the teas and all the toast;",
    "With thankful tongue and bowing attitude,",
    "I here present you with my gratitude:",
    "Next for you apples, pears and plums",
    "Acknowledgment in order comes;",
    "For wine, for ale, for fowl, for fish\u2014for",
    "Ev\u2019n all one\u2019s appetite can wish for:",
    "But O ye pens, and O ye pencils,",
    "And all ye scribbling utensils,",
    "Say in what words and in what metre,",
    "Shall unfeign\u2019d admiration greet her,",
    "For that rich banquet so refin\u2019d",
    "Her conversation gave the mind;",
    "The solid meal of sense and worth,",
    "Set off by the desert of mirth;",
    "Wit\u2019s fruit and pleasure\u2019s genial bowl,",
    "And all the joyous flow of soul;",
    "For these, and every kind ingredient",
    "That form\u2019d your love\u2014your most obedient."

    "Naked by the water",
    "Under a lean of canvas she\u2019d sewn",
    "With a thick paraffin thread,",
    "She gestured.",
    "From the river",
    "His left leg was meal. Crayfish in the hair.",
    "The river bottom left his shoulder",
    "Layered and crocheted\u2014",
    "My sister\u2019s pearl knitting needles",
    "Clicking in my head. I told",
    "The sheriff I wouldn\u2019t do it again.",
    "I knew him once. His Chevy threw a rod.",
    "I made it with him",
    "On the hood of the old truck.",
    "It was out at the dump beyond Yuma.",
    "It felt like I had bread crumbs",
    "All over my mouth. Wacky with the sun,",
    "I sure did it with him enough",
    "That afternoon. I didn\u2019t",
    "Know it was him who\u2019d drowned.",
    "They said it was his cousin.",
    "He had a three-cornered scar",
    "At the small of his back. And a deposit",
    "Of calcium on the tailbone.",
    "We\u2019re not much, you know?",
    "He was tangled in yellow tree roots,",
    "He spun in the currents,",
    "A fishhook and line running",
    "From his thumb.",
    "A whole new ball of wax, I thought.",
    "I wanted to be an astronaut.",
    "But failed the mathematics",
    "Twice in one summer.",
    "So I raise Nubian goats.",
    "My favorite has a purple manure",
    "That comes out like steaming packets",
    "Of tobacco mulch. He sprays",
    "The shack with his seed\u2014",
    "It hasn\u2019t needed paint in three years.",
    "I just took my shorts off",
    "When you two came down the hill.",
    "It\u2019s that rubber suit I wear",
    "When I dive into the chute and cave.",
    "Sometimes I just feel",
    "Like old air in a patched tire. Then,",
    "I get my Seagram\u2019s and come out here.",
    "You two look married. Not that I care.",
    "You wouldn\u2019t believe what I was just thinking\u2014",
    "Your husband\u2019s the only living man",
    "Left in this country",
    "Who knows that I bleach my hair."

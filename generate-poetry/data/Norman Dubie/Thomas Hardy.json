    "The first morning after anyone\u2019s death, is it important",
    "To know that fields are wet, that the governess is",
    "Naked but with a scarf still covering her head, that",
    "She\u2019s sitting on a gardener who\u2019s wearing",
    "Just a blue shirt, or that he\u2019s sitting on a chair in the kitchen.",
    "They look like they are rowing while instead outside in the mist",
    "Two boats are passing on the river, the gardener\u2019s mouth",
    "Is opening:",
    "A white, screaming bird lifts off the river into the trees,",
    "Flies a short distance and is joined",
    "By a second bird, but then as if to destroy everything",
    "The two white birds are met by a third.",
    "Always fails. The cows are now standing in the barns.",
    "You can hear the milk as it drills into wooden pails."

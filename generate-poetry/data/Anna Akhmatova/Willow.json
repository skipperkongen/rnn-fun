    "...and a decrepit handful of trees.",
    "\u2014Aleksandr Pushkin",
    "And I matured in peace born of command,",
    "in the nursery of the infant century,",
    "and the voice of man was never dear to me,",
    "but the breeze\u2019s voice\u2014that I could understand.",
    "The burdock and the nettle I preferred,",
    "but best of all the silver willow tree.",
    "Its weeping limbs fanned my unrest with dreams;",
    "it lived here all my life, obligingly.",
    "I have outlived it now, and with surprise.",
    "There stands the stump; with foreign voices other",
    "willows converse, beneath our, beneath those skies,",
    "and I am hushed, as if I\u2019d lost a brother."

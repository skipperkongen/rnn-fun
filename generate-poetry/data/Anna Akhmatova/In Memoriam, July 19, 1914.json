    "We aged a hundred years and this descended",
    "In just one hour, as at a stroke.",
    "The summer had been brief and now was ended;",
    "The body of the ploughed plains lay in smoke.",
    "The hushed road burst in colors then, a soaring",
    "Lament rose, ringing silver like a bell.",
    "And so I covered up my face, imploring",
    "God to destroy me before battle fell.",
    "And from my memory the shadows vanished",
    "Of songs and passions\u2014burdens I'd not need.",
    "The Almighty bade it be\u2014with all else banished\u2014",
    "A book of portents terrible to read."

    "St. Patrick\u2019s Day! St. Patrick\u2019s Day!",
    "Oh! thou tormenting Irish lay\u2014",

    "And cannot turn thee out again.",

    "But not in such a shape as this,",
    "When all I do, and all I say,",
    "Begins and ends in Patricks\u2019s Day.",
    "Had it but been in opera shape,",
    "Italian squall, or German scrape,",
    "Fresh from the bow of Paganini,",
    "Or caught from Weber of Rossini,",
    "One would not care so much\u2014but, oh!",
    "The sad plebeian shame to know",
    "An old blind fiddler bore away",
    "My senses with St. Patrick\u2019s Day.",
    "I take up Burke in hopes to chase",
    "The plaguing phantom from its place;",
    "But all in vain\u2014attention wavers",
    "From classic lore to triplet quavers;",
    "An \u201cEssay\u201d on the great \u201cSublime\u201d",
    "Sounds strangely set in six-eight time.",
    "Down goes the book, read how I may,",
    "The words will flow to Patrick\u2019s Day."

    "No changes of support\u2014only",
    "Patches of gray, here where sunlight fell.",
    "The house seems heavier",
    "Now that they have gone away.",
    "In fact it emptied in record time.",
    "When the flat table used to result",
    "A match recedes, slowly, into the night.",
    "The academy of the future is",
    "Opening its doors and willing",
    "The fruitless sunlight streams into domes,",
    "The chairs piled high with books and papers.",
    "The sedate one is this month\u2019s skittish one",
    "Confirming the property that,",
    "A timeless value, has changed hands.",
    "And you could have a new automobile",
    "Ping pong set and garage, but the thief",
    "Stole everything like a miracle.",
    "In his book there was a picture of treason only",
    "And in the garden, cries and colors."

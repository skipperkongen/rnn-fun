    "This poem is concerned with language on a very plain level.",
    "Look at it talking to you. You look out a window",
    "Or pretend to fidget. You have it but you don\u2019t have it.",
    "You miss it, it misses you. You miss each other.",
    "The poem is sad because it wants to be yours, and cannot.",
    "What\u2019s a plain level? It is that and other things,",
    "Bringing a system of them into play. Play?",
    "Well, actually, yes, but I consider play to be",
    "A deeper outside thing, a dreamed role-pattern,",
    "As in the division of grace these long August days",
    "Without proof. Open-ended. And before you",
    "It gets lost in the steam and chatter of typewriters.",
    "It has been played once more. I think you exist only",
    "To tease me into doing it, on your level, and then you aren\u2019t there",
    "Or have adopted a different attitude. And the poem",
    "Has set me softly down beside you. The poem is you."

    "That night the wind stirred in the forsythia bushes,",
    "but it was a wrong one, blowing in the wrong direction.",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s silly. How can there be a wrong direction?",
    "\u2018It bloweth where it listeth,\u2019 as you know, just as we do",
    "when we make love or do something else there are no rules for.\u201d",
    "I tell you, something went wrong there a while back.",
    "Just don\u2019t ask me what it was. Pretend I\u2019ve dropped the subject.",
    "No, now you\u2019ve got me interested, I want to know",
    "exactly what seems wrong to you, how something could",
    "seem wrong to you. In what way do things get to be wrong?",
    "I\u2019m sitting here dialing my cellphone",
    "with one hand, digging at some obscure pebbles with my shovel",
    "with the other. And then something like braids will stand out,",
    "on horsehair cushions. That armchair is really too lugubrious.",
    "We\u2019ve got to change all the furniture, fumigate the house,",
    "talk our relationship back to its beginnings. Say, you know",
    "that\u2019s probably what\u2019s wrong\u2014the beginnings concept, I mean.",
    "I aver there are no beginnings, though there were perhaps some",
    "sometime. We\u2019d stopped, to look at the poster the movie theater",
    "had placed freestanding on the sidewalk. The lobby cards",
    "drew us in. It was afternoon, we found ourselves",
    "sitting at the end of a row in the balcony; the theater was unexpectedly",
    "crowded. That was the day we first realized we didn\u2019t fully",
    "know our names, yours or mine, and we left quietly",
    "amid the gray snow falling. Twilight had already set in."

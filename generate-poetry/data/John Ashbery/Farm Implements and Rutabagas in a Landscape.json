    "The first of the undecoded messages read: \u201cPopeye sits in thunder,",
    "Unthought of. From that shoebox of an apartment,",
    "From livid curtain\u2019s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: \u201cHow pleasant",
    "To spend one\u2019s vacation",
    "\u201d she scratched",
    "Her cleft chin\u2019s solitary hair. She remembered spinach",
    "And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach.",
    "\u201cM\u2019love,\u201d he intercepted, \u201cthe plains are decked out in thunder",
    "Today, and it shall be as you wish.\u201d He scratched",
    "The part of his head under his hat. The apartment",
    "Seemed to grow smaller. \u201cBut what if no pleasant",
    "Inspiration plunge us now to the stars?",
    "\u201d",
    "Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country.",
    "Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach",
    "When the door opened and Swee\u2019pea crept in. \u201cHow pleasant!\u201d",
    "But Swee\u2019pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. \u201cThunder",
    "And tears are unavailing,\u201d it read. \u201cHenceforth shall Popeye\u2019s apartment",
    "Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.\u201d",
    "Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched",
    "Her long thigh. \u201cI have news!\u201d she gasped. \u201cPopeye, forced as you know to flee the country",
    "One musty gusty evening, by the schemes of his wizened, duplicate father, jealous of the apartment",
    "And all that it contains, myself and spinach",
    "In particular, heaves bolts of loving thunder",
    "At his own astonished becoming, rupturing the pleasant",
    "Arpeggio of our years. No more shall pleasant",
    "Rays of the sun refresh your sense of growing old, nor the scratched",
    "Tree-trunks and mossy foliage, only immaculate darkness and thunder.\u201d",
    "She grabbed Swee\u2019pea. \u201cI\u2019m taking the brat to the country.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut you can\u2019t do that\u2014he hasn\u2019t even finished his spinach,\u201d",
    "Urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment.",
    "But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment",
    "Succumbed to a strange new hush. \u201cActually it\u2019s quite pleasant",
    "Here,\u201d thought the Sea Hag. \u201cIf this is all we need fear from spinach",
    "Then I don\u2019t mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over\u201d\u2014she scratched",
    "One dug pensively\u2014\u201cbut Wimpy is such a country",
    "Bumpkin, always burping like that.\u201d Minute at first, the thunder",
    "Soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder,",
    "The color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched",
    "His balls: it sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country."

    "\u2019Tis to yourself I speak; you cannot know",
    "Him whom I call in speaking such an one,",
    "For thou beneath the earth lie buried low,",
    "Which he alone as living walks upon;",
    "Thou mayst at times have heard him speak to you,",
    "And often wished perchance that you were he;",
    "And I must ever wish that it were true,",
    "For then thou couldst hold fellowship with me;",
    "But now thou hear\u2019st us talk as strangers, met",
    "Above the room wherein thou liest abed;",
    "A word perhaps loud spoken thou mayst get,",
    "Or hear our feet when heavily they tread;",
    "But he who speaks, or him who\u2019s spoken to,",
    "Must both remain as strangers still to you."

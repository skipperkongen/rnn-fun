    "I have no Brother,\u2014they who meet me now",
    "Offer a hand with their own wills defiled,",
    "And, while they wear a smooth unwrinkled brow,",
    "Know not that Truth can never be beguiled;",
    "Go wash the hand that still betrays thy guilt;",
    "Before the spirit\u2019s gaze what stain can hide?",
    "Abel\u2019s red blood upon the earth is spilt,",
    "And by thy tongue it cannot be denied;",
    "I hear not with my ear,\u2014the heart doth tell",
    "Its secret deeds to me untold before;",
    "Go, all its hidden plunder quickly sell,",
    "Then shalt thou cleanse thee from thy brother\u2019s gore,",
    "Then will I take thy gift; that bloody stain",
    "Shall not be seen upon thy hand again."

    "Every bus ride is theater, giddy schoolgirls trying on",
    "the tawdry masks of women, flirting with my nephew,",

    "glistered skeletal mannequins in slips of iridescent silk.",
    "At night in the wind blowing over the Pont Marie I hear",

    "and two days before Christmas Elliot and I stand",
    "miraculously alone before",
    ", follow her eyes,",
    "cracked surface of her skin like softest sand before the deep",

    "Rimbaud as we take the bus to see Pasolini\u2019s",
    "the master himself as Chaucer, spinning his ribald stories",
    "of human folly, each one a mirror, and when I see myself",
    "in bus windows or store glass, the shock never wears off,",
    "for I recognize myself and see a stranger at the same time,",
    "because the minutes are racing by at the speed of light,",
    "and I am saying goodbye to Paris, to everyone, myself",
    "most of all, watching her disappear down the rue Jeanne d\u2019Arc,",
    "and what can she possibly be thinking as she walks",
    "to the movies in the middle of this afternoon of her life?"

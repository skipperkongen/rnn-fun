    "There must be a Russian word to describe what has happened",
    "between us, like",
    ", which can be used",
    "for a cup of tea that is too hot, but after you walk to the next room,",
    "and return, it is too cool; or",
    ",",
    "which is to want something so much over months",
    "and even years that when you get it, you have lost",
    "the desire. Pushkin said, when he saw his portrait by Kiprensky,",
    "\u201cIt is like looking into a mirror, but one that flatters me.\u201d",
    "What is the word for someone who looks into her friend\u2019s face",
    "and sees once smooth skin gone like a train that has left",
    "the station in Petersburg with its wide avenues and nights",
    "at the Stray Dog Cafe, sex with the wrong men,",
    "who looked so right by candlelight, when everyone was young",
    "and smoked hand-rolled cigarettes, painted or wrote",
    "all night but nothing good, drank too much vodka, and woke",
    "in the painful daylight with skin like fresh cream, books",
    "everywhere, Lorca on Gogol, Tolstoy under Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9,",
    "so that now, on a train in the taiga of Siberia,",
    "I see what she sees \u2014 all my books alphabetized and on shelves,",
    "feet misshapen, hands ribbed with raised veins,",
    "neck crumpled like last week\u2019s newspaper, while her friends",
    "are young, their skin pimply and eyes bright as puppies\u2019,",
    "and who can blame her, for how lucky we are to be loved",
    "for even a moment, though I can\u2019t help but feel like Pushkin,",
    "a rough ball of lead lodged in his gut, looking at his books",
    "and saying, \u201cGoodbye, my dear friends,\u201d as those volumes",
    "close and turn back into oblong blocks, dust clouding",
    "the gold leaf that once shimmered on their spines."

    "Not a remarkable wind.",
    "So when the bistro\u2019s patio umbrella",
    "blew suddenly free and pitched",
    "into the middle of the road,",
    "it put a stop to the afternoon.",
    "Something white and amazing",
    "was blocking the way.",
    "A waiter in a clean apron",
    "appeared, not quite",
    "certain, shielding his eyes, wary",
    "of our rumbling engines.",
    "He knelt in the hot road,",
    "making two figures in white, one",
    "leaning over the sprawled,",
    "broken shape of the other,",
    "creaturely, great-winged,",
    "and now so carefully gathered in."

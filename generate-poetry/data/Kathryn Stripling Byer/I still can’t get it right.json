    "I don\u2019t know. I still can\u2019t get it right,",
    "the way those dirt roads cut across the flats",
    "and led to shacks where hounds and muddy shoats",
    "skulked roundabouts. Describing it sounds trite",
    "as hell, the good old South I love to hate.",
    "The truth? What\u2019s that? How should I know?",
    "I stayed inside too much. I learned to boast",
    "of stupid things. I kept my ears shut tight,",
    "as we kept doors locked, windows locked,",
    "the curtains drawn. Now I know why.",
    "The dark could hide things from us. Dark could see",
    "what we could not. Sometimes those dirt roads shocked",
    "me, where they ended up: I watched a dog die",
    "in the ditch. The man who shot him winked at me."

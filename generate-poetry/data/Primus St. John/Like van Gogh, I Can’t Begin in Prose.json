    "1 Dear Milton,",
    "Rain. But when you are here, alone, what does it",
    "mean. It means psalm \u2014 that song sung to the harp.",
    "Like trees, we too hold on to the earth \u2014 pull and",
    "twang for another tongue.",
    "(whatever",
    "is, and",
    "who knows that) is a sacred song.",
    "is strange for",
    "we are the ones who glorify mystery with our arms.",
    "We call it testament because it pries at our souls",
    "with many branches, and so you say with a huge",
    "eye, we must practice our art like the third stomach",
    "of a cud-chewing animal:",
    "here they are, the strength of your arm",
    "stalls at the open gate of the stars.",
    "Feel everything, trust everything!\u201d",
    "We are always limited to what we ask for (so why",
    "not ask for wings). Therefore, desire becomes a flight",
    "marker. For surely we hover over what we have done",
    "as though we have wings \u2014 looking for signs that will",
    "tell us where to go, and if we have gone somewhere,",
    "what it means. Milton, like David of old, like David",
    "of old or any child, we live on the tip of that lean",
    "tongue of invocation with our sling, saying:",
    "I stand on the smallest stone.",
    "I am a standing prairie dog",
    "praying for my song.\u201d",
    "And so we have come to know: what is sacred is",
    "the storm, how the winds shimmer in the pool. . .",
    "how \u201cbrushes are frightened.\u201d",
    "Milton, it is right to say:",
    "for though",
    "I know that my savior is lonely.\u201d",
    "you also know",
    "riding on my shoulders with its stars.\u201d",
    "Of course I\u2019m biased; what\u2019s a friend for! But I",
    "think you have done what you should have done \u2014",
    "gone to the fountainhead and glorified in psalm.",
    "It may please you to know that out there, rain,",
    "too, gives in large quantities.",
    "Love to family,",
    "2 Dear Love to Family,",
    "how can I eat this?",
    "My teeth are in my grave,",
    "my promises broken.\u201d",
    "On that anvil called home, we beat out family. It",
    "is enough and lovely to learn from our own. To say,",
    "my Paula.\u201d",
    "On that anvil called home, we are like van Gogh",
    "\u2014 thinking always in vivid colors that are both silent",
    "and raging. For without it we would have no capac-",
    "ity for peace \u2014 or war. We would be unable to settle",
    "or plan, or to love and fear tales.",
    "This is the center that allows us to pass among",
    "people \u2014 the beautiful black night with all the stars. . .",
    "3 Dear Beautiful Black Night with All the Stars,",
    "Swimming in the pool it occurs to you,",
    "else.\u201d In this context, completely surrounded, every-",
    "thing must live.",
    "4 Dear Everything Must Live,",
    "No country, no culture, no person, can give us more",
    "than the \u201crant of the ordinary life.\u201d",
    "5 Dear Rant of the Ordinary Life,",
    "What we hand to our children is our truth. As large",
    "as we are, it is small. Fragile in a bed, you learn",
    "about infirmity\u2019s strong arms:",
    "Your heart is the real house you breathe in. Old",
    "love\u2019s fantasy is there; it has young feet:",
    "I want to weep.\u201d",
    "We are never at peace. Because, all our work comes",
    "back. It spies on us as round as the moon:",
    "Look at that moon!",
    "It looks like it\u2019s right",
    "On top of us.\u201d",
    "6 Dear Right on Top of Us,",
    "Around us, life and death. Someone born like us \u2014",
    "gone. Blackburn, like a magician\u2019s stroke of the",
    "wand \u2014 gone.",
    "On a freighter, you stare into the water and go to",
    "your ancestral home. You think about small Selma,",
    "all the occupied zones we are, how our fingertips are",
    "almost like birds.",
    "Once, when you were a boy, you let go of the",
    "fence. You are still falling.",
    "7 Dear You Are Still Falling,",
    "You are a cantor whose strange songs absorb",
    "mystery, and that is not sailing too far.",
    "So long. . .",

    "\u2018Good gracious! how you hop!",
    "Over the fields and the water too,",
    "As if you never would stop!",

    "\u2018This requires some little reflection;",
    "Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,",
    "And there seems but one objection,",
    "Which is, if you\u2019ll let me speak so bold,",
    "Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,",

    "IV",
    "Said the Duck, \u2018As I sate on the rocks,",
    "I have thought over that completely,",
    "And I bought four pairs of worsted socks",
    "Which fit my web-feet neatly.",
    "And to keep out the cold I\u2019ve bought a cloak,",
    "And every day a cigar I\u2019ll smoke,",

    "Said the Kangaroo, \u2018I\u2019m ready!",
    "All in the moonlight pale;",
    "But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!",
    "And quite at the end of my tail!\u2019",
    "So away they went with a hop and a bound,",
    "And they hopped the whole world three times round;",
    "And who so happy,\u2014O who,",
    "As the Duck and the Kangaroo?."

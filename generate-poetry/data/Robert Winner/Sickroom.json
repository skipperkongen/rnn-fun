    "I try to carry the gravestone",
    "from the darkness of my mother's sickroom\u2014",
    "scratches of light around drawn shades\u2014",
    "outside, the gold and red of autumn.",
    "She is like a queen in exile",
    "scraping with her nails on silk walls",
    "her message of anger, her weak",
    "insatiable demands and regrets.",
    "I want her to grow rosy old",
    "like a maple leaf, ripening,",
    "yielding only to that ice edged wind that must come",
    "and cut her down\u2014like me, like everyone."

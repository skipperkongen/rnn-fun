    "Surviving in its fragile skin,",

    "from the gulf of its strength.",

    "to fall on my hand,",
    "a pine with ravaged limbs.",
    "I'd stare through salt-blind eyes",
    "at a remote fragile sea. I'd roar.",
    "I'd make the skeleton of grief.",
    "I'd roar like you, unreconciled sea."

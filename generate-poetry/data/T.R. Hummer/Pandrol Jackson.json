    "Along a derelict railroad, abandoned machinery takes",
    "its last tour of duty toward rust. Another town is stalling.",
    "Another house smolders with rot while a television rages.",

    ". We were Jews in Austria. No, we spoke German",
    "in Czechoslovakia\u2014by order of the Alliance, we filed",
    "Into a railroad car and died. No, we were black in Arkansas.",
    "Here is a filthy contraption, like a grim lawn mower",
    "With flanged iron wheels,",
    "in blue paint",
    "on its rotted housing: a rail grinder, used to polish steel",
    "To brilliance, forgotten here as after the Rapture. And the carcass",
    "of a boxcar warps just down the track, groaning with a cargo of bones."

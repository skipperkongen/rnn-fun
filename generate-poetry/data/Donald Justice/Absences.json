    "It's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers.",
    "There is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote,",
    "Like the memory of scales descending the white keys",
    "Of a childhood piano\u2014outside the window, palms!",
    "And the heavy head of the cereus, inclining,",
    "Soon to let down its white or yellow-white.",
    "Now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap,",
    "Like the memory of a white dress cast down . . .",
    "So much has fallen.",
    "And I, who have listened for a step",
    "All afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away,",
    "Already in memory. And the terrible scales descending",
    "On the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers",
    "abounding."

    "There is a gold light in certain old paintings",
    "That represents a diffusion of sunlight.",
    "It is like happiness, when we are happy.",

    "Orpheus hesitated beside the black river.",
    "With so much to look forward to he looked back.",

    "The world is very dusty, uncle. Let us work.",

    "The orchard will bloom; someone will play the guitar.",
    "Our work will be seen as strong and clean and good.",
    "And all that we suffered through having existed",
    "Shall be forgotten as though it had never existed."

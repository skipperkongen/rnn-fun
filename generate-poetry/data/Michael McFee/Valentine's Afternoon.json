    "Four lanes over, a plump helium heart\u2014",
    "slipped, maybe, from some kid's wrist",
    "or a rushed lover's empty front seat",
    "through a half-cracked car window\u2014",
    "rises like a shiny purple cloudlet",
    "toward today's gray mess of clouds,",
    "trailing its gold ribbon like lightning",
    "that will never strike anything",
    "or anyone here on the forsaken ground,",
    "its bold LOVE increasingly illegible",
    "as it ascends over the frozen oaks,",
    "riding swift currents toward the horizon,",
    "a swollen word wobbling out of sight."

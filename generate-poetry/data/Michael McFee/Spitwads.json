    "Little paper cuds we made",
    "by ripping the corners or edges",
    "from homework and class notes",
    "then ruminating them into balls",
    "we\u2019d flick from our fingertips",
    "or catapult with pencils",
    "or (sometimes after lunch)",
    "launch through striped straws",
    "like deadly projectiles",
    "toward the necks of enemies",
    "and any other target where they\u2019d",
    "stick with the tiniest splat,",
    "I hope you\u2019re still there,",
    "stuck to unreachable ceilings",
    "like the beginnings of nests",
    "by generations of wasps",
    "too ignorant to finish them",
    "or under desktops with blunt",
    "stalactites of chewing gum,",
    "little white words we learned",
    "to shape and hold in our mouths",
    "while waiting to let them fly,",
    "our most tenacious utterance."

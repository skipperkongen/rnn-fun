    "How well its square",

    "pierced with 13 holes",
    "in rows of 3 and 2,",
    "its edges perforated",
    "like a postage stamp,",
    "one of a shifting stack",
    "sealed in wax paper",
    "whose noisy opening",
    "always signaled",
    "peanut butter or cheese",
    "thick inside Premiums,",
    "the closest we ever got",
    "to serving",
    "the redneck\u2019s hardtack,",

    "He stood on his stoop",
    "and clapped her sneakers together",
    "hard, a sharp report,",
    "smacking right sole against left,",
    "trying to shock the mud",
    "from each complicated tread,",
    "spanking those expensive footprints",
    "until clay flakes and plugs",
    "ticked onto the boxwood\u2019s leaves",
    "like a light filthy sleet",
    "from the rubber craters and crannies",
    "where they stuck weeks ago,",
    "until her shoes were banged clean",
    "though that didn\u2019t stop",
    "his stiff-armed slow-motion applause",
    "with her feet\u2019s emptied gloves,",
    "slapping mate against mate",
    "without missing a beat,",
    "half-wishing that hollow sound",
    "echoing off their neighbors\u2019 houses",
    "could call her back."

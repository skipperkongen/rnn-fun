    "Learn from the man who spends much of his life speaking",
    "To the back of your head knowing what it means to follow",
    "The razor\u2019s edge along a worn strop or random thoughts",
    "As they spring so invisibly from the mind to a mouth",
    "Who shouldered soldiers in two wars and fled fire fields",
    "Undecorated who fathered once but was fatherless forever",
    "And who works his sentiments in deeper into your scalp",
    "Under a sign on the knotty-pine walls whose rubric reads",
    "which means he sees",
    "In you his suffering smells of horehound tonics and gels",
    "Pillow heads and powders and a floor full of snippings",
    "Swept neatly every evening into a pile for the field mice",
    "All those roundabout hours only a man who fixes his tie",
    "To clip crabgrass crowding a lady\u2019s grave could believe",
    "With a certain clean devotion and who would never for one",
    "Moment dream of hurting you when your back was turned"

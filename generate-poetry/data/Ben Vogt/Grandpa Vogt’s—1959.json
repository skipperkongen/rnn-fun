    "The food is on the table. Turkey tanned",
    "to a cowboy boot luster, potatoes mashed",
    "and mounded in a bowl whose lip is lined",
    "with blue flowers linked by grey vines faded",
    "from washing. Everyone\u2019s heads have turned",
    "to elongate the table\u2019s view\u2014a last supper twisted",
    "toward a horizon where the Christmas tree, crowned",
    "by a window, sets into itself half inclined.",
    "Each belly cries. Each pair of eyes admonished",
    "by Aunt Photographer. Look up. You\u2019re wined",
    "and dined for the older folks who\u2019ve pined",
    "to see your faces, your lives, lightly framed",
    "in this moment\u2019s flash. Parents are moved,",
    "press their children\u2019s heads up from the table,",
    "hide their hunger by rubbing lightly wrinkled",
    "hands atop their laps. They\u2019ll hold the image",
    "as long as need be, seconds away from grace."

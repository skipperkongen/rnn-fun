    "Words can bang around in your head",
    "Forever, if you let them and you give them room.",
    "I used to love poetry, and mostly I still do,",
    "Though sometimes \u201cI, too, dislike it.\u201d There must be",
    "Something real beyond the fiddle and perfunctory",
    "Consolations and the quarrels\u2014as of course",
    "There is, though what it is is difficult to say.",
    "I didn\u2019t know what it was, and I don\u2019t know now,",
    "But it was what I started out to do, and now, a lifetime later,",
    "All I\u2019ve really done.",
    "Roots and Branches, Rivers and Mountains",
    "Alone, their fragments shored against the ruin or revelation",
    "That was sure to come, breathing in their secret atmosphere,",
    "Repeating them until they almost seemed my own.",
    "We like to think our lives are what they study to become,",
    "And yet so much of life is waiting, waiting on a whim.",
    "So much of what we are is sheer coincidence,",
    "Like a sentence whose significance is retrospective,",
    "Made up out of elementary particles that are in some sense",
    "Simply sounds, like syllables that finally settle into place.",
    "You probably think that this is a poem about poetry",
    "(And obviously it is), yet its real subject is time,",
    "For that\u2019s what poetry is\u2014a way to live through time",
    "And sometimes, just for a while, to bring it back.",
    "A paneled dining room in Holder Hall. Stage right, enter twit:",
    "\u201cMr. Ashbery, I\u2019m your biggest campus fan.\u201d We hit it off",
    "And talked about \u201cThe Skaters\u201d and my preference for \u201cClepsydra\u201d",
    "Vs. \u201cFragment.\u201d Later on that night John asked me to a party in New York,",
    "From Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s, who finally wandered down. I talked to him",
    "A little about",
    "And quoted a line from \u201cPoem\u201d about the rain, which seemed to please him too.",
    "The party ended, John and I went off to Max\u2019s, ordered steaks",
    "I started coming to New York for lunch. We\u2019d meet at",
    "Walk to Fifty-sixth Street to Larre\u2019s, a restaurant filled with French expatriates,",
    "That he and Kenneth Koch and Frank O\u2019Hara\u2014Holy Trinity!",
    "(",
    "There was a dictator named Edgar and some penicillin,",
    "But that\u2019s all I remember. They hadn\u2019t actually been together",
    "In years, but planned to finish it that night at John\u2019s new apartment",
    "On Ninety-fifth Street, and he said to come by for a drink",
    "Before they ate and got to work. It was a New York dream",
    "Come true: a brownstone floor-through, white and full of paintings",
    "(Naturally), \u201cwith a good library and record collection.\u201d",
    "John had procured a huge steak, and as I helped him set the table",
    "The doorbell rang and Frank O\u2019Hara, fresh from the museum",
    "And svelte in a hound\u2019s tooth sports coat entered, followed shortly",
    "By \u201cexcitement-prone Kenneth Koch\u201d in somber gray,",
    "And I was one with my immortals. In the small mythologies",
    "We make up out of memories and the flow of time",
    "A few moments remain frozen, though the feel of them is lost,",
    "The feel of talk. It ranged from puns to gossip, always coming back",
    "To poems and poets. Frank was fiercely loyal to young poets",
    "Leaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drink,",
    "Which is what everyone had. I think you see where it was going:",
    "Conversation drifting into dinner, then I stayed for dinner",
    "And everyone forgot about the play, which was never finished",
    "(Though I think I\u2019ve seen a fragment of it somewhere). I see a table",
    "In a cone of light, but there\u2019s no sound except for Kenneth\u2019s",
    "Deadpan \u201cLove to see a boy eat\u201d as I speared a piece of steak;",
    "And then the only voice I\u2019m sure I hear is mine,",
    "As those moments that had once seemed singular and clear",
    "Dissolve into a \u201cgeneral mess of imprecision of feeling\u201d",
    "And images, augmented by line breaks. There were phone calls,",
    "Other people arrived, the narrative of the night dissolved",
    "And finally everyone went home. School and spring wound down.",
    "The semester ended, then the weekend that I wrote about in \u201cSally\u2019s Hair\u201d",
    "Arrived and went, and then a late-night cruise around Manhattan for a rich friend\u2019s",
    "And failed (thank God) to rouse him, caught a plane to San Diego",
    "The next day, worked at my summer job and worked on poems",
    "And started reading Proust, and got a card one afternoon",
    "From Peter Schjeldahl telling me that Frank O\u2019Hara had been killed.",
    "Ninety-fifth Street soldiered on for several years.",
    "I remember a cocktail party (the symposium of those days),",
    "Followed by dinner just around the corner at Elaine\u2019s,",
    "Pre-Woody Allen. It was there I learned of R.F.K.\u2019s assassination",
    "When I woke up on the daybed in the living room, and where",
    "John told me getting married would ruin me as a poet",
    "\u201cIf this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don\u2019t mind so much\u201d",
    "(Which was probably premature\u2014watering his plants one day",
    "She soaked his landlord, Giorgio Cavallon, dozing in the garden below).",
    "It was where Peter Delacorte late one night recited an entire side",
    "Of a",
    "To his friends\u2019 subsequent dismay, and where he blessed me with his extra copy",
    "Of",
    "Sometimes a vague, amorphous stretch of years assumes a shape,",
    "But that\u2019s the way life flows: in stages that take form in retrospect,",
    "A sense of freedom\u2014one which gradually slipped away. The center",
    "Of the conversation moved downtown, the Renaissance gave way to mannerism",
    "The laws proscribing what you couldn\u2019t do were clear. I got so tired",
    "Of writing all those New York poems (though by then I\u2019d moved to Boston\u2014",
    "To Siena, you might say) that led to nowhere but the next one,",
    "So I started writing poems about whatever moved me: what it\u2019s",
    "To be alive within a world that holds no place for you, yet seems so beautiful;",
    "The feeling of the future, and its disappointments; the trajectory of a life,",
    "That always brought me back to time and memory (I\u2019d finished Proust by then),",
    "And brings me back to this. John finally moved downtown himself,",
    "Into a two-story apartment at Twenty-fifth and Tenth, with a spiral staircase",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s so",
    "The poetry still continued\u2014mine and everyone\u2019s. I\u2019d added Jimmy",
    "To my pantheon (as you\u2019ve probably noticed), but the night in nineteen sixty-six",
    "Seemed more and more remote: I never saw Kenneth anymore,",
    "John moved again, to Twenty-second Street, and Susan and I moved to Milwaukee,",
    "Where our son was born. I stopped coming to New York, and writing poems,",
    "And as though on cue two people whom I hadn\u2019t seen in years\u2014David Kalstone,",
    "Back to John\u2019s and out to dinner\u2014as though I\u2019d never been away,",
    "Turned up everywhere, with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove.",
    "Half my life was still to come, and yet the rest was mostly personal:",
    "I got divorced, and Willy killed himself, and here I am now, ready to retire.",
    "There was an obituary in the",
    "A painter you\u2019ll recall from Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems (\u201cWhy I Am Not a Painter,\u201d",
    "\u201cOde to Michael Goldberg (\u2019s Birth and Other Births)\u201d). I didn\u2019t know him,",
    "The New York art world demimonde was there, including nearly everyone",
    "Who\u2019s turned up in this poem. I remember staring at a guy who",
    "Looked like something from the Black Lagoon, dancing with a gorgeous",
    "Woman half his age. That\u2019s",
    "O brave new world (now old) that had such people in\u2019t!",
    "\u201cThe tiresome old man is telling us his life story.\u201d",
    "I guess I am, but that\u2019s what poets do\u2014not always",
    "Quite as obviously as this, and usually more by indirection",
    "And omission, but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality",
    "And unreality of an individual life. I see it as a long,",
    "Illuminated tunnel, lined with windows giving on the scenes outside\u2014",
    "On Ninety-fifth Street forty years ago. As life goes on",
    "You start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflection",
    "And the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end.",
    "I try not to look too far ahead, but just to stay here\u2014",
    "Back (as they say) to the day, when poems were more like secrets,",
    "With their own vernacular, and you could tell your friends",
    "By who and what they read. And now John\u2019s practically become",
    "A national treasure, and whenever I look up I think I see him",
    "Floating in the sky like the Cheshire Cat. I don\u2019t know",
    "What to make of it, but it makes me happy\u2014like seeing Kenneth",
    "Just before he died (\u201cI\u2019m going west John, I\u2019m going west\u201d)",
    "In his apartment on a side street near Columbia, or remembering",
    "Once again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six.",
    "I like to think of them together once again, at the cocktail party",
    "At the end of the mind, where I could blunder in and ruin it one last time.",
    "Meanwhile, on a hillside in the driftless region to the west,",
    "A few miles from the small town where",
    "I\u2019m building a house on a meadow, if I\u2019m permitted to return,",
    "Of an upland pasture without heaviness. I see myself",
    "Sitting on the deck and sipping a martini, as I used to at Larre\u2019s,",
    "In a future that feels almost like a past I\u2019m positive is there\u2014",
    "But where? I think my life is still all conversation,",
    "Only now it\u2019s with myself. I can see it continuing forever,",
    "Even in my absence, as I close the windows and turn off the lights",
    "And it begins to rain. And then we\u2019re there together",
    "In the house on the meadow, waiting for whatever\u2019s left to come",
    "In what\u2019s become the near future\u2014two versions of myself",
    "And of the people that we knew, each one an other",
    "To the other, yet both indelibly there: the twit of twenty",
    "And the aging child of sixty-two, still separate",
    "And searching in the night, listening through the night",
    "To the noise of the rain and memories of rain",
    "And evenings when we\u2019d wander out into the Renaissance,",
    "When I could see you and talk to you and it could still",
    "And still there in the morning when the rain has stopped,",
    "And the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light."

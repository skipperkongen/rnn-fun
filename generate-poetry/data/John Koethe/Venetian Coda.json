    "Sometimes I dream what\u2019s called the",
    ":",
    "I\u2019m going somewhere not too far away, I\u2019m almost there,",
    "When there\u2019s a slight delay\u2014a minor detour of no consequence,",
    "But then another, and another, as I get farther and farther",
    "Away from my initial destination, which becomes inaccessible.",
    "Before I left Berlin I went to Venice, a city that reminds me of that dream.",
    "However close you are to where you want to go, the compound",
    "Turnings of its narrow passageways and alleys carry you relentlessly away,",
    "Until you dead-end at a small canal that\u2019s nowhere on your map.",
    "The late, wrecked century that started in Berlin, where all roads lead\u2014",
    "I thought I\u2019d find, if not the truth exactly, then at least an inkling",
    "Of some fantasy that lay beneath the placid surface of the day,",
    "The remnants of some dream so many people had to die for. Instead,",
    "I watched the boats go by, and clouds traverse the sky",
    "Above an unreal city floating on the water. We\u2019re sure at first",
    "That something lies beyond the facts and books, but then we realize it isn\u2019t there.",
    "Whatever lay behind the slaughter wasn\u2019t in the world,",
    "Existing merely in the heart, in memory, in someone\u2019s imagination,",
    "Places harboring nothing real. To try to see it is to watch it disappear,",
    "Stranding you a life away from where the unimaginable began,",
    "Staring blankly at your own face floating in the water."

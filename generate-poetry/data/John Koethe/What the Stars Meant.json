    "On a backwards-running clock in Lisbon,",
    "By the marble statue of Pessoa;",
    "On an antique astrolabe in London",
    "Tracing out the sky above Samoa,",
    "Thousands of miles away\u2014in time, in place,",
    "Each night conspires to create a myth",
    "That stands for nothing real, yet leaves you with",
    "The vague impression of a human face.",
    "The fragments fly apart and shift, trembling",
    "On the threshold of a kind of fullness:",
    "The minor wonder of remembering;",
    "The greater wonders of forgetfulness.",
    "For one looks back as someone else might yearn",
    "For a new life, and set his course upon",
    "The polestar, bid his adieus, and move on.",
    "The journey takes a solipsistic turn,",
    "Forsaking starlight for an inner glow,",
    "And reducing all human history,",
    "All human culture\u2014highbrow, middle-, low-\u2014",
    "To one reflecting surface, one story.",
    "What fills the heaven of a single mind?",
    "The things that used to fill Kant\u2019s mind with awe",
    "\u2014\u201cThe starry heavens and the moral law\u201d\u2014",
    "Seem distant now, and difficult to find",
    "Amid the message of satiety",
    "Issuing from the corners of the sky,",
    "Filled with monotonous variety:",
    "Game shows, an interview with Princess Di,",
    "And happy talk, and sitcoms and the news,",
    "The shit that floats across your living room",
    "Each weekday evening. Waiting in the pews,",
    "Out in the desert where the cacti bloom,",
    "Something else was forming, something stranger",
    "Gathering in the gulf below the stairs\u2014",
    "As though the mystery of the manger",
    "Were written in the day-to-day affairs",
    "Of a world consecrated to Mammon,",
    "Yet governed by those sacred absences",
    "That make the spirit soar, and presences",
    "At one remove, like the sound of Cuban",
    "Drumbeats issuing from the Ricardos\u2019",
    "Love nest on the television station",
    "Like distant thunder; or Leonardo\u2019s",
    "\u201cWave that flees the site of its creation.\u201d",
    "In the desert far beyond the city,",
    "One hears the cadences for which one longs,",
    "The lyrics of those half-forgotten songs,",
    "\u2014Some of them poignant, some of them witty\u2014",
    "Brimming with the melody of passage;",
    "One feels the wind that blows the soul about,",
    "Repeating its inscrutable message;",
    "And as night falls, one sees the stars come out.",
    "I found myself beneath a canopy",
    "Of scenes left out of someone else\u2019s life",
    "\u2014The dog that didn\u2019t bark, Rosebud, Cain\u2019s wife\u2014",
    "Arrayed above me in a panoply",
    "Of glittering debris, gigantic swirls",
    "Of stars, and slowly moving caravans",
    "Of stars like tiny Christmas lights or pearls",
    "Of tapioca, floating in a danse",
    "macabre across the heavens as I stood,",
    "Watching the pageant in the sky unfold.",
    "I felt the chill of something much too old",
    "To comprehend\u2014not the Form of the Good,",
    "But something inchoate and violent,",
    "A Form of Darkness. Suddenly the songs",
    "Floating through the revelry fell silent,",
    "As in",
    ", as throngs",
    "Of the dead twinkled at me from above.",
    "The intimate domain of memory",
    "Became an endless field of entropy",
    "Transfigured, inking in the outlines of",
    "Eurydice entombed, Orpheus immured,",
    "And, in the center of their universe,",
    "That subtler diadem of stars obscured",
    "By the brighter constellations, the Hearse.",
    "Standing off to one side, as though bereft,",
    "There was a figure with averted eyes,",
    "Gesturing in a language of surprise",
    "That took possession of my heart, yet left",
    "The question of her meaning unresolved.",
    "I looked at her. It was time to begin.",
    "The apparations in the sky dissolved,",
    "Leaving me alone, and growing old. In",
    "The wide, unstructured heavens overhead",
    "The stars were still shining. When I got home,",
    "The message light was blinking on the phone.",
    "I don\u2019t remember what the message said."

    "At a church rummage sale, I study the perfection of shadows",
    "in a painting by Caravaggio, although what I hold",
    "is only a small print of Christ\u2014its frame broken\u2014dining",
    "at Emmaus with three of the Apostles. And because the table",
    "is dramatically, if not unbelievably, lit, the bowls & pitcher",
    "& loaves send their dark crescents onto the immaculate",
    "white cloth. When the Savior raises his hand to offer a blessing,",
    "its shade deepens further his crimson smock.",
    "that rich, convincing darkness. As though the master understood",
    "that the obscured world only seems to us somehow",
    "even more familiar, as though our sense of our own unknowing",
    "had at last been made visible\u2014even if what we do not know",
    "cannot itself be seen. The future\u2019s drape, the carnival fortunetellers",
    "of my childhood might have called it, but also the now\u2019s,",
    "displayed as it is\u2014so many unmatched cups & saucers, old coats",
    "& wicker baskets\u2014all around us. At a party last week,",
    "someone said",
    ". We were huddled on a tiny porch.",
    "It was the first cool night & the wine had no conclusion.",
    "The talk turned quickly to shepherds & the pastoral & then,",
    "to opera, before someone recalled a horror film he\u2019d watched",
    "late one night with his brother. In black & white vignettes,",
    "an evil tree stump possessed by the spirit of an executed prince",
    "hunts the scheming tribal elders who have destroyed him.",
    "A former pro wrestler in a costume of wire & rubber bark",
    "& wearing a permanent scowl lumbers after vengeance",
    "in the confusion & fear of 1957 on a half-dozen root-legs,",
    "driving his victims into quicksand or toppling himself over",
    "upon him. Though here the point is the teller\u2019s small brother",
    "& the boy\u2019s allegiance, even in a state of",
    ",",
    "to what we call",
    ". How, he wanted to know, suddenly",
    "unusually earnest, did the tree manage to get itself up again?",
    "Yesterday I spoke to a friend who is despairing: back home,",
    "waiting tables, he\u2019s dating a woman whose marriage has only",
    "just come to an end. When he wakes, he discovers he does not",
    "recognize himself. One afternoon, walking home from school,",
    "I hit my best friend in the face with a book. It may well be",
    "that she hit me. Thin pages flew out into the street. More punches",
    "were thrown & I came away bruised. In that book, a novel",
    "by Emily Bront\u00eb, the land is violent & unjust & we are violent",
    "& unjust upon it. Even worse, our greatest passions",
    "change nothing at all. Before one of us hit the other,",
    "there must have been a cause, but I can\u2019t recall it, which makes it",
    "seem nonlinear now, &, thus, apocryphal, both impossible",
    "& impossibly real. I failed, though I tried, to offer comfort.",
    "It\u2019s not that our lives don\u2019t resemble our lives. I\u2019ve been alone",
    "so often lately I sometimes catch myself watching myself\u2014",
    "breathing in the fresh spears of rosemary or admiring the shallots,",
    "peeling their translucent wrappers away, centering one on the board,",
    "making the first careful cut, lifting the purple halves.",
    "Before stories, we were too busy for stories, too busy",
    "hunting & suffering to invent the tales of our own",
    "resurrections. Caught out in the kitchen\u2019s brightness last night,",
    "the handle of the skillet cast its simple, perfected form",
    "across the stove\u2014pierced, like the eye of the needle, so that",
    "it can be hung from a hook, as pans, presumably, have always been.",
    "Outside the wind picked up. Thunder. The dog trotted off,",
    "hid her head beneath the chair. But today: a charity sale",
    "at Trinity Chapel & sun on the tar of the buckled walks.",
    "In the cracks, beads of water spin into light. Tell yourself",
    "it\u2019s simple: this is where it\u2019s been heading all along. Tell yourself",
    "something you have no faith in has already begun to occur."

    "Less the shadow",
    "than you a stag, sudden, through it.",
    "Less the stag breaking cover than",
    "the antlers, with which",
    "crowned.",
    "Less the antlers as trees leafless,",
    "to either side of the stag\u2019s head, than\u2014",

    "mean, surely, rescue.",
    "Less the rescue.",
    "More, always, the ache",
    "toward it.",
    "When I think of death, the gleam of",
    "the world darkening, dark, gathering me",
    "now in, it is lately",
    "as one more of many other nights",
    "figured with the inevitably",
    "black car, again the stranger\u2019s",
    "strange room entered not for prayer",
    "but for striking",

    "kneeling, bending, until it finds",
    "the muscled patterns that",
    "predictably, given strain and",
    "release, flesh assumes.",
    "When I think of desire,",
    "it is in the same way that I do",
    "God: as parable, any steep",
    "and blue water, things that are always",
    "there, they only wait",
    "to be sounded.",
    "And I a stone that, a little bit, perhaps",
    "should ask pardon.",
    "My fears\u2014when I have fears\u2014",
    "are of how long I shall be, falling,",
    "and in my at last resting how",
    "indistinguishable, inasmuch as they",
    "are countless, sire,",
    "all the unglittering other dropped stones."

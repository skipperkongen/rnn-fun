    "Meanwhile the sea moves uneasily, like a man who",
    "suspects what the room reels with as he rises into it",
    "is violation\u2014his own: he touches the bruises at each",
    "shoulder and, on his chest,",
    "the larger bruise, star-shaped,",
    "a flawed star, or hand, though he remembers no hands,",
    "has tried\u2014can't remember . . .",
    "That kind of rhythm to it,",
    "even to the roughest surf there's a rhythm findable,",
    "which is why we keep coming here, to find it, or that's",
    "what we say. We dive in and, as usual,",
    "the swimming",
    "feels like that swimming the mind does in the wake",
    "of transgression, how the instinct to panic at first",
    "slackens that much more quickly, if you don't",
    "look back. Regret,",
    "like pity, changes nothing really, we",
    "say to ourselves and, less often, to each other, each time",
    "swimming a bit farther,",
    "leaving the shore the way",
    "the water\u2014in its own watered, of course, version",
    "of semaphore\u2013keeps leaving the subject out, flashing",
    "and",
    "as the waves beat harder, hard against us, until that's",
    "how we like it, I'll break your heart, break mine."

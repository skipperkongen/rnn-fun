    "No eye that sees could fail to remark you:",

    "what leaf, this time of year, is so pale,",

    "loss and more loss, approaching? Give up",
    "the flesh enough times, and whatever is lost",
    "gets forgotten: that was the thought that I",
    "woke to, those words in my head. I rose,",
    "I did not dress, I left no particular body",
    "sleeping and, stepping into the hour, I saw",
    "you, strange sign, at once transparent and",
    "impossible to entirely see through. and how",
    "still: the still of being unmoved, and then",
    "the still of no longer being able to be",

    "without remembering another I once saw:",
    "like you, except that something, a bird, some",
    "wild and necessary hunger, had gotten to it;",
    "and like the diva, but now broken, splayed",
    "and torn, the green torn piecemeal from her.",
    "I remember the hands, and\u2014how small they",
    "seemed, bringing the small ripped thing to me."

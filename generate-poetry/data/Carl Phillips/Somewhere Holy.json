    "There are places in this world where",
    "you can stand somewhere holy and be",
    "thinking If it\u2019s holy then why don\u2019t",
    "I feel it, something, and while waiting,",
    "like it will any moment happen and",
    "maybe this is it, a man accosts you,",
    "half in his tongue, half in yours, he",
    "asks if maybe you are wanting to get",
    "high, all the time his damaged finger",
    "twitching idly like on purpose at a",
    "leash that holds an animal you can\u2019t",
    "quite put your finger on at first, until",
    "you ask him, ask the man, and then",
    "he tells you it\u2019s a weasel and, of",

    "you, it\u2019s life, it\u2019s life in general",
    "where it hurts, a fear, of everything,",
    "of nothing, when if only they would name",
    "it maybe then you\u2019d stay, you all the",
    "time aware it\u2019s you that\u2019s talking, so",
    "who\u2019s going anywhere but here, beside them,",
    "otherwise why come, why keep on coming,",
    "when you can\u2019t get to believing what",
    "they tell you any more than you believed",
    "the drugs the other man was offering",
    "wouldn\u2019t harm you. Still, you think, you",
    "took them and you\u2019re still alive, enough",
    "to take the hand, that wants, that",
    "promises to take you to where damage is",
    "a word, that\u2019s all, like yes,",

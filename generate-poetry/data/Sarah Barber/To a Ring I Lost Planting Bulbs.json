    "You give me the slip between garlic and lilies,",
    "as if this is what comes of my unprotected",
    "loves, of my hands in the sweet earth,",
    "their willful miscegenation of the border bed",
    "where you\u2019re tucked in deep with tulips, too,",
    "like just one more of their heart-freaks:",
    "a fluke diamondine flake, a thin vein gone gold.",
    "Being mine, you\u2019ll grow up a girdled tree, girt",
    "with a ringed-around root, nothing like",
    "the fruitful vine of good wives\u2014one of which",
    "I\u2019ll never be so, my not-love-knot, you may",
    "as well come up instead like a kiss:",
    "the one wind gives to rouse the Japanese maple,",
    "October\u2019s aerialist, its bright aureole",
    "in the last late sun a red mouth, opening."

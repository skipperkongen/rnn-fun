    "When we finally flip it over",
    "the fireflies are out. The neighbor boy",
    "has had his stitches in so I can finally admit",
    "I think it is all fantastic: the suck",
    "of the spark plug undone, the stuck blade",
    "bent into the guard, and the sound",
    "of the hammer\u2019s head reshaping the metal.",
    "In this our suburban Eden we\u2019ve only",
    "a teenage Adam too dreamy to manage",
    "his motorized scythe and silly Eve leaving",
    "her coffee cups and plastic plant pots",
    "behind in the grass. Though it\u2019s a long way",
    "from a fall, this spring\u2019s first disaster,",
    "I did like the thin thread of red",
    "on his upper lip, and I like my mower",
    "turned over among the glowworms,",
    "a monstrous dandelion as unnatural as we",
    "are, out in a garden, with our untidy",
    "golds and our dangerous sharps."

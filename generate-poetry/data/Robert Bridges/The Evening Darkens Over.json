    "The evening darkens over",
    "After a day so bright",
    "The windcapt waves discover",
    "That wild will be the night.",
    "There\u2019s sound of distant thunder.",
    "The latest sea-birds hover",
    "Along the cliff\u2019s sheer height;",
    "As in the memory wander",
    "Last flutterings of delight,",
    "White wings lost on the white.",
    "There\u2019s not a ship in sight;",
    "And as the sun goes under",
    "Thick clouds conspire to cover",
    "The moon that should rise yonder.",
    "Thou art alone, fond lover."

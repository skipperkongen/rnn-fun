    "Love not too much. But how,",
    "When thou hast made me such,",
    "And dost thy gifts bestow,",
    "How can I love too much?",
    "Though I must fear to lose,",
    "And drown my joy in care,",
    "With all its thorns I choose",
    "The path of love and prayer.",
    "Though thou, I know not why,",
    "Didst kill my childish trust,",
    "That breach with toil did I",
    "Repair, because I must:",
    "And spite of frighting schemes,",
    "With which the fiends of Hell",
    "Blaspheme thee in my dreams,",
    "So far I have hoped well.",
    "But what the heavenly key,",
    "What marvel in me wrought",
    "Shall quite exculpate thee,",
    "I have no shadow of thought.",
    "What am I that complain?",
    "The love, from which began",
    "My question sad and vain,",
    "Justifies thee to man."

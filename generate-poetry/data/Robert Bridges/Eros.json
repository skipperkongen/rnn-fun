    "Why hast thou nothing in thy face?",
    "Thou idol of the human race,",
    "Thou tyrant of the human heart,",
    "The flower of lovely youth that art;",
    "Yea, and that standest in thy youth",
    "An image of eternal Truth,",
    "With thy exuberant flesh so fair,",
    "That only Pheidias might compare,",
    "Ere from his chaste marmoreal form",
    "Time had decayed the colours warm;",
    "Like to his gods in thy proud dress,",
    "Thy starry sheen of nakedness.",
    "Surely thy body is thy mind,",
    "For in thy face is nought to find,",
    "Only thy soft unchristen\u2019d smile,",
    "That shadows neither love nor guile,",
    "But shameless will and power immense,",
    "In secret sensuous innocence.",
    "O king of joy, what is thy thought?",
    "I dream thou knowest it is nought,",
    "And wouldst in darkness come, but thou",
    "Makest the light where\u2019er thou go.",
    "Ah yet no victim of thy grace,",
    "None who e\u2019er long\u2019d for thy embrace,",
    "Hath cared to look upon thy face."

    "he roared. I remember one sequence: a gulf in his thinking",
    "meant swim as fast as you can. But it was winter and the water",
    "was closed. The mouths of the children were sealed with ice.",
    "After all, we were swimming in emotion, not water.",
    "\u201cShut up! you Father!\u201d I shouted over my shoulder. Racing,",
    "but not spent, my mind went, \u201cIt isn\u2019t good that the human being",
    "is all I have to go by .... It isn\u2019t good that I know who I love",
    "but not who I trust .... It isn\u2019t good that I can run to a priest",

    "Still, we both would be able to see the edge of the problem.",
    "It\u2019s true that the person is also a thing.",
    "When you are running you know the texture. I was clawing",
    "at the palm of one hand and brushing up my blues with the other.",

    "Ahead was the one with magnified eyes and historical data to last.",
    "Know-how and the hysteria to accomplish his whole life.",
    "It was horrible what we would do for peace.",
    "We told him the story of the suffering he made us feel",
    "with the ingratiating stoop of those who came second in the world."

    "The guests are floating in the lobby,",
    "walking but also gliding to the front desk",
    "then away, checking in, checking out,",
    "muscular souls adorned in cotton,",
    "wool, and rayon, chewing the future",
    "inside their heads, slicing the air",
    "with ironed pleats, avoiding the camera",
    "at every turn so as, so as to get it right",
    "this time, which is the first time.",
    "\u201cFirst cut, best cut!\u201d the director shouts",
    "since this is also a silent film for the deaf",
    "and therefore everyone. His aim",
    "is to get the cast to see what they\u2019ve",
    "been missing, to disregard the very sounds",
    "that they don\u2019t hear to begin with,",
    "but would notice immediately",
    "if they were gone. See how they glide",
    "on the ether above the floor.",
    "The insouciance, Lord. The insouciance!",
    "They are all here in the magic of the set,",
    "every soul in the guise of a guest",
    "going about her business, a rendezvous here,",
    "as assignation there, the solitary sipping",
    "at the bar. Someone striking appears",
    "at the door. The rain outside beats down",
    "on the streets with terrible force until all",
    "you can hear is the roar of the sky as it passes",
    "above, and then below, on its narrow tracks."

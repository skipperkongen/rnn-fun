    "The nurse calls to tell me on Sunday evenings",
    "how he\u2019s doing.",
    "How he\u2019s holding his own in front",
    "of the window with a thousand channels behind",
    "the one that saves his screen with snow, fish houses,",
    "and eagles.",
    "How the days hang above the ice as vast",
    "recycled pages on which he writes in invisible ink.",
    "How the sun arcs across the sky, then breaks like a plate",
    "above the horizon.",
    "How the temperature drops",
    "below zero at dusk, then continues to fall till morning.",
    "In this way she teaches me how to speak to him in his sleep",
    "at his home in Minnesota, which is the same, she says,",
    "as talking to a friend you\u2019ve never met, but grown close to",
    "nonetheless from hearing his voice.",
    "I hear the snow",
    "falling as she holds the phone outside the window.",
    "Silence is the sound of snow falling on snow, I think",
    "as I listen to the flakes inside the air before she closes",
    "the window.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of walleye in their sleep,\u201d",
    "I tell my father.",
    "\u201cOf catching them as they dream,",
    "then throwing them back in the hole I drilled by hand",
    "with the auger you gave me as a child, whose handle is stained",
    "with blood from my turning it so many times into the ice",
    "of Bad Medicine.\u201d",
    "I wait for her voice to return, then say,",
    "\u201cJust this for now since any more would disappear the lake",
    "inside his head on which he builds a house for us to fish",
    "throughout the winter.\u201d"

    "He manages like somebody carrying a box",
    "that is too heavy, first with his arms",
    "underneath. When their strength gives out,",
    "he moves the hands forward, hooking them",
    "on the corners, pulling the weight against",
    "his chest. He moves his thumbs slightly",
    "when the fingers begin to tire, and it makes",
    "different muscles take over. Afterward,",
    "he carries it on his shoulder, until the blood",
    "drains out of the arm that is stretched up",
    "to steady the box and the arm goes numb. But now",
    "the man can hold underneath again, so that",
    "he can go on without ever putting the box down."

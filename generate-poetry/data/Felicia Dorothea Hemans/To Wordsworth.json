    "There is a strain to read among the hills,",
    "The old and full of voices \u2014 by the source",
    "Of some free stream, whose gladdening presence fills",
    "The solitude with sound; for in its course",
    "Even such is thy deep song, that seems a part",
    "Of those high scences, a fountain from the heart.",
    "Or its calm spirit fitly may be taken",
    "To the still breast in sunny garden bowers,",
    "Where vernal winds each tree\u2019s low tones awaken,",
    "And bud and bell with changes mark the hours.",
    "There let thy thoughts be with me, while the day",
    "Sinks with a golden and serene decay.",
    "Or by some hearth where happy faces meet,",
    "When night hath hushed the woods, with all their birds,",
    "There, from some gentle voice, that lay were sweet",
    "As antique music, linked with household words;",
    "While in pleased murmurs woman\u2019s lip might move,",
    "And the raised eye of childhood shine in love.",
    "Or where the shadows of dark solemn yews",
    "Brood silently o\u2019er some lone burial-ground,",
    "Thy verse hath power that brightly might diffuse",
    "A breath, a kindling, as of spring, around;",
    "From its own glow of hope and courage high,",
    "And steadfast faith\u2019s victorious constancy.",
    "True bard and holy! \u2014 thou art e\u2019en as one",
    "Who, by some secret gift of soul or eye,",
    "In every spot beneath the smiling sun,",
    "Sees where the springs of living waters lie;",
    "Unseen awhile they sleep \u2014 till, touched by thee,",
    "Bright healthful waves flow forth, to each glad wanderer free."

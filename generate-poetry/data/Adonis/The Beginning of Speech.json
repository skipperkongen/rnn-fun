    "The child I was came to me",
    "once,",
    "a strange face",
    "He said nothing We walked",
    "each of us glancing at the other in silence, our steps",
    "a strange river running in between",
    "We were brought together by good manners",
    "and these sheets now flying in the wind",
    "then we split,",
    "a forest written by earth",
    "watered by the seasons\u2019 change.",
    "Child who once was, come forth\u2014",
    "What brings us together now,",
    "and what do we have to say?"

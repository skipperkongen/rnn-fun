    "1.",
    "The leaves asleep under the wind",
    "are the wounds\u2019 ship,",
    "and the ages collapsed on top of each other",
    "are the wound\u2019s glory,",
    "and the trees rising out of our eyelashes",
    "are the wound\u2019s lake.",
    "The wound is to be found on bridges",
    "where the grave lengthens",
    "and patience goes on to no end",
    "between the shores of our love and death.",
    "The wound is a sign,",
    "and the wound is a crossing too.",
    "2.",
    "To the language choked by tolling bells",
    "I offer the voice of the wound.",
    "To the stone coming from afar",
    "to the dried-up world crumbling to dust",
    "to the time ferried on creaky sleighs",
    "I light up the fire of the wound.",
    "And when history burns inside my clothes",
    "and when blue nails grow inside my books,",
    "I cry out to the day,",
    "\u201cWho are you, who tosses you",
    "into my virgin land?\u201d",
    "And inside my book and on my virgin land",
    "I stare into a pair of eyes made of dust.",
    "I hear someone saying,",
    "\u201cI am the wound that is born",
    "and grows as your history grows.\u201d",
    "3.",
    "I named you cloud,",
    "wound of the parting dove.",
    "I named you book and quill",
    "and here I begin the dialogue",
    "between me and the ancient tongue",
    "in the island of tomes",
    "in the archipelago of the ancient fall.",
    "And here I teach these words",
    "to the wind and the palms,",
    "O wound of the parting dove.",
    "4.",
    "If I had a harbor in the land",
    "of dreams and mirrors, if I had a ship,",
    "if I had the remains",
    "of a city, if I had a city",
    "in the land of children and weeping,",
    "I would have written all this down for the wound\u2019s sake,",
    "a song like a spear",
    "that penetrates trees, stone, and sky,",
    "soft like water",
    "unbridled, startling like conquest.",
    "5.",
    "Rain down on our desert",
    "O world adorned with dream and longing.",
    "Pour down, and shake us, we, the palms of the wound,",
    "tear out branches from trees that love the silence of the wound,",
    "that lie awake staring at its pointed eyelashes and soft hands.",
    "World adorned with dream and longing",
    "world that falls on my brow",
    "like the lash of a wound,",
    "don\u2019t come close\u2014the wound is closer\u2014",
    "don\u2019t tempt me\u2014the wound is more beautiful.",
    "That magic that your eyes had flung",
    "on the last kingdoms\u2014",
    "the wound has passed over it,",
    "passed and did not leave a single sail",
    "to tempt toward salvation, did not leave",
    "a single island behind."

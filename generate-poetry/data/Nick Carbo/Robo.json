    "I must admit to this outright theft.",
    "Before the crickets could impede me,",
    "I reached outside my window",
    "to grab as much of Andalusia as",
    "I could in the palm of my hand.",
    "I took the evening's silver",
    "from the olive trees, the yellow slumber",
    "from the lemons, the recipe for gazpacho.",
    "I made a small incision in my heart",
    "and slipped in as much as my left",
    "and right ventricles could hold.",
    "I reached for a pen and a piece of paper",
    "to ease-out the land into this poem.",
    "I closed the small incision in my heart",
    "and closed the wooden shutters",
    "of my window."

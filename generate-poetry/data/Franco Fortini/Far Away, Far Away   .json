    "Far away, far away, men making wars.",
    "Other folk's blood spilt on other folk's floors.",
    "Only this morning I wounded my finger:",
    "a thorn on my rosebush pierced like a stinger.",
    "Sucking that finger, I thought of the war.",
    "Sad is the earth! And those people, so poor!",
    "I'm of no help, being here and not there,",
    "nor can I reach them, by sea or by air.",
    "And what if I could\u2014what good could I do?",
    "My Arabic's terrible! My English is, too!",
    "What, should I stroll through the fields of the dead",
    "leaving sheaves of my verses under each head?",
    "No. Enough of this wretched irony-fest.",
    "Let's put on a coat. The sun's low in the west."

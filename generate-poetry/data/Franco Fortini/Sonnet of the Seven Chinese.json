    "The Augsburg poet once said he had tacked",
    "an image of the Man of Doubt",
    "to the wall of his room. A Chinese print.",
    "The image asked: how ought one to act?",
    "I have a photo on my wall. Twenty years ago",
    "seven Chinese workers looked into my lens.",
    "They look wary or ironic or tense.",
    "They know I do not write for them. I know",
    "they didn\u2019t live for me. Yet sometimes I feel",
    "I\u2019m being asked for more candid words,",
    "more credible deeds, by their doubtfulness.",
    "In turn I ask their help in making visible",
    "the contradictions and identities among us.",
    "If there\u2019s a point, it\u2019s this."

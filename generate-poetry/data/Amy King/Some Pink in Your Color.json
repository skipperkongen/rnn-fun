    "Did you know I\u2019m in this hospital bed?",
    "I\u2019m not. I\u2019m in the same light you stand in,",
    "much the same way I\u2019m in the waist of your Carolina",
    "watching from the screen across the bed",
    "whose pulse is worn down with an IV to the head.",
    "We are all snow birds atop",
    "the cherry blossoms of August.",
    "Springtime in Washington D.C.",
    "passed too fast, nearly in the flash of Rose",
    "brushing her teeth over the bedpan.",
    "No adrenal gland has known such cortisol,",
    "such heartbreaking",
    "so many soldiers on the brink of their lives returning!",
    "Are we still talking to the same god?",
    "I can\u2019t imagine the heart anymore",
    "now that it presses my ribs apart,",
    "a balloon of such gravity I ache for stars in a jar,",
    "wasps whose love reminds me of fireflies tonight."

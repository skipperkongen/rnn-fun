    "Only open homes & woods & pansies\u2019 blue ledges",
    "can lead the zero with his only arms",
    "to embrace himself in open fields for all to gape upon.",
    "He unbuttons steel-gray sheets, a knotted top coat,",
    "bares himself, his hole, a vision",
    "as framed by the marker that is",
    "where",
    "his body blew and left enclosure intact,",
    "skeletal innards",
    "enough to make moviegoers ask,",

    "the babies are barely dirty,",
    "their armpits smooth with silky soot",
    "weighted in apartment cycles like",
    "we keep movement in boxes for thunderstorms,",
    "and the railroad leaves a dancing behavior",
    "absorbed by every second thought,",
    "escaping the socket that was his mission,",
    "his body incomplete, to help us",
    "to the maidenhead of Niagara,",
    "a target awakening",
    "the chlorophyll of trees,",
    "their tongues the densest forest",
    "canopy and floor",
    "thigh deep with root rot we sleep on and fold",
    "into growing-whole sheep what becomes of the lot:",
    "night\u2019s zero hour",
    "of what is & what isn\u2019t, till death, not us part."

    "and will be absent. Nothing.",
    "On into the what? the air you\u2019re gliding on",
    "or falling from,",
    "the wind of it making",
    "ahs and salves in the hollow of your chest,",
    "Celina of a bodily sibilance like willows,",
    "of the shimmering, midsummer glance.",

    "What leashes you seems to have come undone.",
    "You lean down into the white heap of black words.",
    "You pad out toward the water fountain",
    "into someone\u2019s eyeshadowed look, the lush backwash of her skirt.",
    "You weigh maybe three or four",
    "ounces, swirling down the stairwell",
    "in whichever wind this is, your ribs",
    "aching with what they",
    "sing so shamelessly."

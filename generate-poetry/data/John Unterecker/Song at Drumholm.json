    "My liveliest self, I give you fair leave",
    "in these windblown weathers,",
    "heather-hearted and human and strange,",
    "to turn every blackberry corner",
    "of yesterday\u2019s summer.",
    "The robin, singing her love-me-forever,",
    "kiss-catch-clutch-in the heather",
    "blues, sings tide flow",
    "and autumn\u2019s turning and white",
    "winds folding.",
    "Cattle along all hedges wind winter",
    "into their frosty",
    "breathing, their slow eyes dreaming",
    "barn, bullock, and fodder",
    "under all hedges.",
    "But sea cave and sycamore tell us the world",
    "is wider than weather.",
    "Blackberries darken the corners",
    "I turn, and gold seas turning",
    "darken, darken.",
    "My liveliest self, my other, Godspeed",
    "on our farings.",
    "The bronze path at evening. Toward summer,",
    "then. My hand, your hand\u2014",
    "as if first meeting."

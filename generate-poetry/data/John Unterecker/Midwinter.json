    "At dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay:",
    "Waves were broken scrolls. Beyond Donegal, white mountains",
    "hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky.",
    "Later, there was sleet: trees down",
    "on the Drumholm road; near Timoney\u2019s farm, a frantic goose",
    "pinned under branches.",
    "All night long, we spoke of loneliness,",
    "long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.",
    "Then the sky cleared and a marvel began: The hills turned blue;",
    "in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day\u2019s first plume of smoke.",
    "It gathered like a dream drenched in frost.",
    "That should have been all. We had worn out night.",
    "But single-file, deliberate, five heifers, a black bull, three calves stepped through the",
    "broken fence.",
    "They arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram:",
    "a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.",
    "Their image is with me still. The backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as",
    "morning."

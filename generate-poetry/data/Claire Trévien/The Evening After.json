    "One evening, tired of games and each other,",
    "we spent watching our reflections on a screen",
    "\u2014 four in a two-seater, angling like sardines.",
    "For a dog\u2019s hair I\u2019d milked the wine, uttered",
    "words like, \u201cthat\u2019s the cure!\u201d swiveled",
    "the puckering glass like a mock-dandy,",
    "blood slushing at my temples, until the spill,",
    "a fatal expression on the white and navy,",
    "ruined the smoothness past salvation. A cough",
    "of salt, the patting of the fabric, perhaps enough."

    "Cold blew the freezing northern blast,",
    "And winter sternly frowned;",
    "The flaky snow fell thick and fast,",
    "And clad the fields around.",
    "Forced by the storm\u2019s relentless power,",
    "Emboldened by despair,",
    "A shivering redbreast sought my door,",
    "Some friendly warmth to share.",
    "\u2018Welcome, sweet bird!\u2019 I fondly cried,",
    "\u2018No danger need\u2019st thou fear,",
    "Secure with me thou may\u2019st abide,",
    "Till warmer suns appear.",
    "\u2018And when mild spring comes smiling on,",
    "And bids the fields look gay,",
    "Thou, with thy sweet, thy grateful song,",
    "My kindness shalt repay.\u2019",
    "Mistaken thought! \u2014 But how shall I",
    "The mournful truth display?",
    "An envious cat, with jealous eye,",
    "Had marked him as her prey.",
    "Remorseless wretch! \u2014 her cruel jaws",
    "Soon sealed her victim\u2019s doom,",
    "While I in silence mourn his loss,",
    "And weep o\u2019er robin\u2019s tomb.",
    "So, oft in life\u2019s uneven way,",
    "Some stroke may intervene;",
    "Sweep all our fancied joys away,",
    "And change the flattering scene."

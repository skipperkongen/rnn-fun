    "Holland, that scarce deserves the name of land,",
    "As but th\u2019 off-scouring of the British sand;",
    "And so much earth as was contributed",
    "By English pilots when they heav\u2019d the lead;",
    "Or what by th\u2019 ocean\u2019s slow alluvion fell,",
    "Of shipwrack\u2019d cockle and the mussel-shell;",
    "This indigested vomit of the sea",
    "Fell to the Dutch by just propriety.",
    "Glad then, as miners that have found the ore,",
    "They with mad labour fish\u2019d the land to shore;",
    "And div\u2019d as desperately for each piece",
    "Of earth, as if\u2019t had been of ambergris;",
    "Collecting anxiously small loads of clay,",
    "Less than what building swallows bear away;",
    "Or than those pills which sordid beetles roll,",
    "Transfusing into them their dunghill soul.",
    "How did they rivet, with gigantic piles,",
    "Thorough the centre their new-catched miles;",
    "And to the stake a struggling country bound,",
    "Where barking waves still bait the forced ground;",
    "Building their watry Babel far more high",
    "To reach the sea, than those to scale the sky.",
    "Yet still his claim the injur\u2019d ocean laid,",
    "And oft at leap-frog ore their steeples play\u2019d:",
    "As if on purpose it on land had come",
    "To show them what\u2019s their",
    ".",
    "A daily deluge over them does boil;",
    "The earth and water play at level-coil;",
    "The fish oft-times the burgher dispossest,",
    "And sat not as a meat but as a guest;",
    "And oft the Tritons and the sea-nymphs saw",
    "Whole sholes of Dutch serv\u2019d up for cabillau;",
    "Or as they over the new level rang\u2019d",
    "For pickled",
    ", pickled",
    "chang\u2019d.",
    "Nature, it seem\u2019d, asham\u2019d of her mistake,",
    "Would throw their land away at duck and drake."

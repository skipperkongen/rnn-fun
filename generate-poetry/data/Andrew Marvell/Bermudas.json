    "Where the remote Bermudas ride",
    "In th\u2019 ocean\u2019s bosom unespy\u2019d,",
    "From a small boat, that row\u2019d along,",
    "The list\u2019ning winds receiv\u2019d this song.",
    "What should we do but sing his praise",
    "That led us through the wat\u2019ry maze",
    "Unto an isle so long unknown,",
    "And yet far kinder than our own?",
    "Where he the huge sea-monsters wracks,",
    "That lift the deep upon their backs,",
    "He lands us on a grassy stage,",
    "Safe from the storm\u2019s and prelates\u2019 rage.",
    "He gave us this eternal spring",
    "Which here enamels everything,",
    "And sends the fowls to us in care,",
    "On daily visits through the air.",
    "He hangs in shades the orange bright,",
    "Like golden lamps in a green night;",
    "And does in the pomegranates close",
    "Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.",
    "He makes the figs our mouths to meet",
    "And throws the melons at our feet,",
    "But apples plants of such a price,",
    "No tree could ever bear them twice.",
    "With cedars, chosen by his hand,",
    "From Lebanon, he stores the land,",
    "And makes the hollow seas that roar",
    "Proclaim the ambergris on shore.",
    "He cast (of which we rather boast)",
    "The Gospel\u2019s pearl upon our coast,",
    "And in these rocks for us did frame",
    "A temple, where to sound his name.",
    "Oh let our voice his praise exalt,",
    "Till it arrive at heaven\u2019s vault;",
    "Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may",
    "Echo beyond the Mexic Bay.",
    "Thus sung they in the English boat",
    "An holy and a cheerful note,",
    "And all the way, to guide their chime,",
    "With falling oars they kept the time."

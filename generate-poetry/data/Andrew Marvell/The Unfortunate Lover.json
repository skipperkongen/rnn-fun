    "Alas, how pleasant are their days",
    "With whom the infant Love yet plays!",
    "Sorted by pairs, they still are seen",
    "By fountains cool, and shadows green.",
    "But soon these flames do lose their light,",
    "Like meteors of a summer\u2019s night:",
    "Nor can they to that region climb,",
    "To make impression upon time.",
    "\u2019Twas in a shipwreck, when the seas",
    "Ruled, and the winds did what they please,",
    "That my poor lover floating lay,",
    "And, ere brought forth, was cast away:",
    "Till at the last the master-wave",
    "Upon the rock his mother drave;",
    "And there she split against the stone,",
    "In a Caesarean secti\u00f3n.",
    "The sea him lent those bitter tears",
    "Which at his eyes he always wears;",
    "And from the winds the sighs he bore,",
    "Which through his surging breast do roar.",
    "No day he saw but that which breaks",
    "Through frighted clouds in fork\u00e8d streaks,",
    "While round the rattling thunder hurled,",
    "As at the funeral of the world.",
    "While Nature to his birth presents",
    "This masque of quarrelling elements,",
    "A numerous fleet of cormorants black,",
    "That sailed insulting o\u2019er the wrack,",
    "Received into their cruel care",
    "Th\u2019 unfortunate and abject heir:",
    "Guardians most fit to entertain",
    "The orphan of the hurricane.",
    "They fed him up with hopes and air,",
    "Which soon digested to despair,",
    "And as one cormorant fed him, still",
    "Another on his heart did bill,",
    "Thus while they famish him, and feast,",
    "He both consum\u00e8d, and increased:",
    "And languish\u00e8d with doubtful breath,",
    "The amphib\u00edum of life and death.",
    "And now, when angry heaven would",
    "Behold a spectacle of blood,",
    "Fortune and he are called to play",
    "At sharp before it all the day:",
    "And tyrant Love his breast does ply",
    "With all his winged artillery,",
    "Whilst he, betwixt the flames and waves,",
    "Like Ajax, the mad tempest braves.",
    "See how he nak\u2019d and fierce does stand,",
    "Cuffing the thunder with one hand,",
    "While with the other he does lock,",
    "And grapple, with the stubborn rock:",
    "From which he with each wave rebounds,",
    "Torn into flames, and ragg\u2019d with wounds,",
    "And all he \u2019says, a lover dressed",
    "In his own blood does relish best.",
    "This is the only banneret",
    "That ever Love created yet:",
    "Who though, by the malignant stars,",
    "Forc\u00e8d to live in storms and wars,",
    "Yet dying leaves a perfume here,",
    "And music within every ear:",
    "And he in story only rules,",
    "In a field sable a lover gules."

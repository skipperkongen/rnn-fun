    "The wanton troopers riding by",
    "Have shot my fawn, and it will die.",
    "Ungentle men! they cannot thrive",
    "To kill thee. Thou ne\u2019er didst alive",
    "Them any harm, alas, nor could",
    "Thy death yet do them any good.",
    "I\u2019m sure I never wish\u2019d them ill,",
    "Nor do I for all this, nor will;",
    "But if my simple pray\u2019rs may yet",
    "Prevail with Heaven to forget",
    "Thy murder, I will join my tears",
    "Rather than fail. But oh, my fears!",
    "It cannot die so. Heaven\u2019s King",
    "Keeps register of everything,",
    "And nothing may we use in vain.",
    "Ev\u2019n beasts must be with justice slain,",
    "Else men are made their deodands;",
    "Though they should wash their guilty hands",
    "In this warm life-blood, which doth part",
    "From thine, and wound me to the heart,",
    "Yet could they not be clean, their stain",
    "Is dyed in such a purple grain.",
    "There is not such another in",
    "The world to offer for their sin.",
    "Unconstant Sylvio, when yet",
    "I had not found him counterfeit",
    "One morning (I remember well)",
    "Tied in this silver chain and bell,",
    "Gave it to me; nay, and I know",
    "What he said then; I\u2019m sure I do.",
    "Said he, \u201cLook how your huntsman here",
    "Hath taught a fawn to hunt his",
    ".\u201d",
    "But Sylvio soon had me beguil\u2019d,",
    "This waxed tame, while he grew wild;",
    "And quite regardless of my smart,",
    "Left me his fawn, but took his heart.",
    "Thenceforth I set myself to play",
    "My solitary time away,",
    "With this, and very well content",
    "Could so mine idle life have spent;",
    "For it was full of sport, and light",
    "Of foot and heart, and did invite",
    "Me to its game; it seem\u2019d to bless",
    "Itself in me. How could I less",
    "Than love it? Oh, I cannot be",
    "Unkind t\u2019 a beast that loveth me.",
    "Had it liv\u2019d long, I do not know",
    "Whether it too might have done so",
    "As Sylvio did; his gifts might be",
    "Perhaps as false or more than he.",
    "But I am sure, for aught that I",
    "Could in so short a time espy,",
    "Thy love was far more better then",
    "The love of false and cruel men.",
    "With sweetest milk and sugar first",
    "I it at mine own fingers nurst;",
    "And as it grew, so every day",
    "It wax\u2019d more white and sweet than they.",
    "It had so sweet a breath! And oft",
    "I blush\u2019d to see its foot more soft",
    "And white, shall I say than my hand?",
    "Nay, any lady\u2019s of the land.",
    "It is a wond\u2019rous thing how fleet",
    "\u2019Twas on those little silver feet;",
    "With what a pretty skipping grace",
    "It oft would challenge me the race;",
    "And when \u2019t had left me far away,",
    "\u2019Twould stay, and run again, and stay,",
    "For it was nimbler much than hinds,",
    "And trod, as on the four winds.",
    "I have a garden of my own,",
    "But so with roses overgrown",
    "And lilies, that you would it guess",
    "To be a little wilderness;",
    "And all the spring time of the year",
    "It only loved to be there.",
    "Among the beds of lilies I",
    "Have sought it oft, where it should lie;",
    "Yet could not, till itself would rise,",
    "Find it, although before mine eyes;",
    "For, in the flaxen lilies\u2019 shade,",
    "It like a bank of lilies laid.",
    "Upon the roses it would feed",
    "Until its lips ev\u2019n seemed to bleed,",
    "And then to me \u2019twould boldly trip",
    "And print those roses on my lip.",
    "But all its chief delight was still",
    "On roses thus itself to fill,",
    "And its pure virgin limbs to fold",
    "In whitest sheets of lilies cold.",
    "Had it liv\u2019d long it would have been",
    "Lilies without, roses within.",
    "O help, O help! I see it faint,",
    "And die as calmly as a saint.",
    "See how it weeps! The tears do come,",
    "Sad, slowly dropping like a gum.",
    "So weeps the wounded balsam, so",
    "The holy frankincense doth flow;",
    "The brotherless Heliades",
    "Melt in such amber tears as these.",
    "I in a golden vial will",
    "Keep these two crystal tears, and fill",
    "It till it do o\u2019erflow with mine,",
    "Then place it in Diana\u2019s shrine.",
    "Now my sweet fawn is vanish\u2019d to",
    "Whither the swans and turtles go,",
    "In fair Elysium to endure",
    "With milk-white lambs and ermines pure.",
    "O do not run too fast, for I",
    "Will but bespeak thy grave, and die.",
    "First my unhappy statue shall",
    "Be cut in marble, and withal",
    "Let it be weeping too; but there",
    "Th\u2019 engraver sure his art may spare,",
    "For I so truly thee bemoan",
    "That I shall weep though I be stone;",
    "Until my tears, still dropping, wear",
    "My breast, themselves engraving there.",
    "There at my feet shalt thou be laid,",
    "Of purest alabaster made;",
    "For I would have thine image be",
    "White as I can, though not as thee."

    "My mind was once the true survey",
    "Of all these meadows fresh and gay,",
    "And in the greenness of the grass",
    "Did see its hopes as in a glass;",
    "When Juliana came, and she",
    "What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.",
    "But these, while I with sorrow pine,",
    "Grew more luxuriant still and fine,",
    "That not one blade of grass you spy\u2019d",
    "But had a flower on either side;",
    "When Juliana came, and she",
    "What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.",
    "Unthankful meadows, could you so",
    "A fellowship so true forgo?",
    "And in your gaudy May-games meet",
    "While I lay trodden under feet?",
    "When Juliana came, and she",
    "What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.",
    "But what you in compassion ought,",
    "Shall now by my revenge be wrought;",
    "And flow\u2019rs, and grass, and I and all,",
    "Will in one common ruin fall.",
    "For Juliana comes, and she",
    "What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.",
    "And thus, ye meadows, which have been",
    "Companions of my thoughts more green,",
    "Shall now the heraldry become",
    "With which I shall adorn my tomb;",
    "For Juliana comes, and she",
    "What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me."

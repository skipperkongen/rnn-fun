    "See how the orient dew,",
    "Shed from the bosom of the morn",
    "Into the blowing roses,",
    "Yet careless of its mansion new,",
    "For the clear region where \u2019twas born",
    "Round in itself incloses:",
    "And in its little globe\u2019s extent,",
    "Frames as it can its native element.",
    "How it the purple flow\u2019r does slight,",
    "Scarce touching where it lies,",
    "But gazing back upon the skies,",
    "Shines with a mournful light,",
    "Like its own tear,",
    "Because so long divided from the sphere.",
    "Restless it rolls and unsecure,",
    "Trembling lest it grow impure,",
    "Till the warm sun pity its pain,",
    "And to the skies exhale it back again.",
    "So the soul, that drop, that ray",
    "Of the clear fountain of eternal day,",
    "Could it within the human flow\u2019r be seen,",
    "Remembering still its former height,",
    "Shuns the sweet leaves and blossoms green,",
    "And recollecting its own light,",
    "Does, in its pure and circling thoughts, express",
    "The greater heaven in an heaven less.",
    "In how coy a figure wound,",
    "Every way it turns away:",
    "So the world excluding round,",
    "Yet receiving in the day,",
    "Dark beneath, but bright above,",
    "Here disdaining, there in love.",
    "How loose and easy hence to go,",
    "How girt and ready to ascend,",
    "Moving but on a point below,",
    "It all about does upwards bend.",
    "Such did the manna\u2019s sacred dew distill,",
    "White and entire, though congealed and chill,",
    "Congealed on earth : but does, dissolving, run",
    "Into the glories of th\u2019 almighty sun."

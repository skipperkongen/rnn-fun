    "Ye living lamps, by whose dear light",
    "The nightingale does sit so late,",
    "And studying all the summer night,",
    "Her matchless songs does meditate;",
    "Ye country comets, that portend",
    "No war nor prince\u2019s funeral,",
    "Shining unto no higher end",
    "Than to presage the grass\u2019s fall;",
    "Ye glow-worms, whose officious flame",
    "To wand\u2019ring mowers shows the way,",
    "That in the night have lost their aim,",
    "And after foolish fires do stray;",
    "Your courteous lights in vain you waste,",
    "Since Juliana here is come,",
    "For she my mind hath so displac\u2019d",
    "That I shall never find my home."

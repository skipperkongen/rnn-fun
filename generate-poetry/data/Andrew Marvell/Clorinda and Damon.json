    "Damon, come drive thy flocks this way.",
    "No, \u2019tis too late; they went astray.",
    "I have a grassy scutcheon spied,",
    "Where Flora blazons all her pride.",
    "The grass I aim to feast thy sheep:",
    "The flowers I for thy temples keep.",
    "Grass withers; and the flowers too fade.",
    "Seize the short joys then, ere they vade,",
    "Seest thou that unfrequented cave?",
    "That den?",
    "Love\u2019s Shrine.",
    "But virtue\u2019s grave.",
    "In whose cool bosom we may lie",
    "Safe from the sun.",
    "Not heaven\u2019s eye.",
    "Near this, a fountain\u2019s liquid bell",
    "Tinkles within the concave shell.",
    "Might a soul bathe there and be clean,",
    "Or slake its drought?",
    "What is\u2019t you mean?",
    "These once had been enticing things,",
    "Clorinda, pastures, caves, and springs.",
    "And what late change?",
    "The other day",
    "Pan met me.",
    "What did great Pan say?",
    "Words that transcend poor shepherds\u2019 skill,",
    "But he e\u2019er since my songs does fill:",
    "And his name swells my slender oat.",
    "Sweet must Pan sound in Damon\u2019s note.",
    "Clorinda\u2019s voice might make it sweet.",
    "Who would not in Pan\u2019s praises meet?",
    "Of Pan the flowery pastures sing,",
    "Caves echo, and the fountains ring.",
    "Sing then while he doth us inspire;",
    "For all the world is our Pan\u2019s choir."

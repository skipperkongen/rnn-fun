    "Hark how the Mower Damon sung,",
    "With love of Juliana stung!",
    "While everything did seem to paint",
    "The scene more fit for his complaint.",
    "Like her fair eyes the day was fair,",
    "But scorching like his am\u2019rous care.",
    "Sharp like his scythe his sorrow was,",
    "And withered like his hopes the grass.",
    "\u2018Oh what unusual heats are here,",
    "Which thus our sunburned meadows sear!",
    "The grasshopper its pipe gives o\u2019er;",
    "And hamstringed frogs can dance no more.",
    "But in the brook the green frog wades;",
    "And grasshoppers seek out the shades.",
    "Only the snake, that kept within,",
    "Now glitters in its second skin.",
    "\u2018This heat the sun could never raise,",
    "Nor Dog Star so inflame the days.",
    "It from an higher beauty grow\u2019th,",
    "Which burns the fields and mower both:",
    "Which mads the dog, and makes the sun",
    "Hotter than his own Pha\u00ebton.",
    "Not July causeth these extremes,",
    "But Juliana\u2019s scorching beams.",
    "\u2018Tell me where I may pass the fires",
    "Of the hot day, or hot desires.",
    "To what cool cave shall I descend,",
    "Or to what gelid fountain bend?",
    "Alas! I look for ease in vain,",
    "When remedies themselves complain.",
    "No moisture but my tears do rest,",
    "Nor cold but in her icy breast.",
    "\u2018How long wilt thou, fair shepherdess,",
    "Esteem me, and my presents less?",
    "To thee the harmless snake I bring,",
    "Disarm\u00e8d of its teeth and sting;",
    "To thee chameleons, changing hue,",
    "And oak leaves tipped with honey dew.",
    "Yet thou, ungrateful, hast not sought",
    "Nor what they are, nor who them brought.",
    "\u2018I am the Mower Damon, known",
    "Through all the meadows I have mown.",
    "On me the morn her dew distills",
    "Before her darling daffodils.",
    "And, if at noon my toil me heat,",
    "The sun himself licks off my sweat.",
    "While, going home, the evening sweet",
    "In cowslip-water bathes my feet.",
    "\u2018What, though the piping shepherd stock",
    "The plains with an unnumbered flock,",
    "This scythe of mine discovers wide",
    "More ground than all his sheep do hide.",
    "With this the golden fleece I shear",
    "Of all these closes every year.",
    "And though in wool more poor than they,",
    "Yet am I richer far in hay.",
    "\u2018Nor am I so deformed to sight,",
    "If in my scythe I look\u00e8d right;",
    "In which I see my picture done,",
    "As in a crescent moon the sun.",
    "The deathless fairies take me oft",
    "To lead them in their dances soft:",
    "And, when I tune myself to sing,",
    "About me they contract their ring.",
    "\u2018How happy might I still have mowed,",
    "Had not Love here his thistles sowed!",
    "But now I all the day complain,",
    "Joining my labour to my pain;",
    "And with my scythe cut down the grass,",
    "Yet still my grief is where it was:",
    "But, when the iron blunter grows,",
    "Sighing, I whet my scythe and woes.\u2019",
    "While thus he threw his elbow round,",
    "Depopulating all the ground,",
    "And, with his whistling scythe, does cut",
    "Each stroke between the earth and root,",
    "The edg\u00e8d steel by careless chance",
    "Did into his own ankle glance;",
    "And there among the grass fell down,",
    "By his own scythe, the Mower mown.",
    "\u2018Alas!\u2019 said he, \u2018these hurts are slight",
    "To those that die by love\u2019s despite.",
    "With shepherd\u2019s-purse, and clown\u2019s-all-heal,",
    "The blood I staunch, and wound I seal.",
    "Only for him no cure is found,",
    "Whom Juliana\u2019s eyes do wound.",
    "\u2019Tis death alone that this must do:",
    "For Death thou art a Mower too.\u2019"

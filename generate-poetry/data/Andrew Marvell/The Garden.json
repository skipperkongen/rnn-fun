    "How vainly men themselves amaze",
    "To win the palm, the oak, or bays,",
    "And their uncessant labours see",
    "Crown\u2019d from some single herb or tree,",
    "Whose short and narrow verged shade",
    "Does prudently their toils upbraid;",
    "While all flow\u2019rs and all trees do close",
    "To weave the garlands of repose.",
    "Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,",
    "And Innocence, thy sister dear!",
    "Mistaken long, I sought you then",
    "In busy companies of men;",
    "Your sacred plants, if here below,",
    "Only among the plants will grow.",
    "Society is all but rude,",
    "To this delicious solitude.",
    "No white nor red was ever seen",
    "So am\u2019rous as this lovely green.",
    "Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,",
    "Cut in these trees their mistress\u2019 name;",
    "Little, alas, they know or heed",
    "How far these beauties hers exceed!",
    "Fair trees! wheres\u2019e\u2019er your barks I wound,",
    "No name shall but your own be found.",
    "When we have run our passion\u2019s heat,",
    "Love hither makes his best retreat.",
    "The gods, that mortal beauty chase,",
    "Still in a tree did end their race:",
    "Apollo hunted Daphne so,",
    "Only that she might laurel grow;",
    "And Pan did after Syrinx speed,",
    "Not as a nymph, but for a reed.",
    "What wond\u2019rous life in this I lead!",
    "Ripe apples drop about my head;",
    "The luscious clusters of the vine",
    "Upon my mouth do crush their wine;",
    "The nectarine and curious peach",
    "Into my hands themselves do reach;",
    "Stumbling on melons as I pass,",
    "Ensnar\u2019d with flow\u2019rs, I fall on grass.",
    "Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,",
    "Withdraws into its happiness;",
    "The mind, that ocean where each kind",
    "Does straight its own resemblance find,",
    "Yet it creates, transcending these,",
    "Far other worlds, and other seas;",
    "Annihilating all that\u2019s made",
    "To a green thought in a green shade.",
    "Here at the fountain\u2019s sliding foot,",
    "Or at some fruit tree\u2019s mossy root,",
    "Casting the body\u2019s vest aside,",
    "My soul into the boughs does glide;",
    "There like a bird it sits and sings,",
    "Then whets, and combs its silver wings;",
    "And, till prepar\u2019d for longer flight,",
    "Waves in its plumes the various light.",
    "Such was that happy garden-state,",
    "While man there walk\u2019d without a mate;",
    "After a place so pure and sweet,",
    "What other help could yet be meet!",
    "But \u2019twas beyond a mortal\u2019s share",
    "To wander solitary there:",
    "Two paradises \u2019twere in one",
    "To live in paradise alone.",
    "How well the skillful gard\u2019ner drew",
    "Of flow\u2019rs and herbs this dial new,",
    "Where from above the milder sun",
    "Does through a fragrant zodiac run;",
    "And as it works, th\u2019 industrious bee",
    "Computes its time as well as we.",
    "How could such sweet and wholesome hours",
    "Be reckon\u2019d but with herbs and flow\u2019rs!"

  "text": [
    "My love is of a birth as rare",
    "As \u2019tis for object strange and high;",
    "It was begotten by Despair",
    "Upon Impossibility.",
    "Magnanimous Despair alone",
    "Could show me so divine a thing",
    "Where feeble Hope could ne\u2019er have flown,",
    "But vainly flapp\u2019d its tinsel wing.",
    "And yet I quickly might arrive",
    "Where my extended soul is fixt,",
    "But Fate does iron wedges drive,",
    "And always crowds itself betwixt.",
    "For Fate with jealous eye does see",
    "Two perfect loves, nor lets them close;",
    "Their union would her ruin be,",
    "And her tyrannic pow\u2019r depose.",
    "And therefore her decrees of steel",
    "Us as the distant poles have plac\u2019d,",
    "(Though love\u2019s whole world on us doth wheel)",
    "Not by themselves to be embrac\u2019d;",
    "Unless the giddy heaven fall,",
    "And earth some new convulsion tear;",
    "And, us to join, the world should all",
    "Be cramp\u2019d into a planisphere.",
    "As lines, so loves oblique may well",
    "Themselves in every angle greet;",
    "But ours so truly parallel,",
    "Though infinite, can never meet.",
    "Therefore the love which us doth bind,",
    "But Fate so enviously debars,",
    "Is the conjunction of the mind,",
    "And opposition of the stars."

    "Clora, come view my soul, and tell",
    "Whether I have contrived it well.",
    "Now all its several lodgings lie",
    "Composed into one gallery;",
    "And the great arras-hangings, made",
    "Of various faces, by are laid;",
    "That, for all furniture, you\u2019ll find",
    "Only your picture in my mind.",
    "Here thou are painted in the dress",
    "Of an inhuman murderess;",
    "Examining upon our hearts",
    "Thy fertile shop of cruel arts:",
    "Engines more keen than ever yet",
    "Adorned a tyrant\u2019s cabinet;",
    "Of which the most tormenting are",
    "Black eyes, red lips, and curl\u00e8d hair.",
    "But, on the other side, th\u2019art drawn",
    "Like to Aurora in the dawn;",
    "When in the East she slumbering lies,",
    "And stretches out her milky thighs;",
    "While all the morning choir does sing,",
    "And manna falls, and roses spring;",
    "And, at thy feet, the wooing doves",
    "Sit p\u00e9rfecting their harmless loves.",
    "Like an enchantress here thou show\u2019st,",
    "Vexing thy restless lover\u2019s ghost;",
    "And, by a light obscure, dost rave",
    "Over his entrails, in the cave;",
    "Divining thence, with horrid care,",
    "How long thou shalt continue fair;",
    "And (when informed) them throw\u2019st away,",
    "To be the greedy vulture\u2019s prey.",
    "But, against that, thou sit\u2019st afloat",
    "Like Venus in her pearly boat.",
    "The halcyons, calming all that\u2019s nigh,",
    "Betwixt the air and water fly;",
    "Or, if some rolling wave appears,",
    "A mass of ambergris it bears.",
    "Nor blows more wind than what may well",
    "Convoy the perfume to the smell.",
    "These pictures and a thousand more",
    "Of thee my gallery do store",
    "In all the forms thou canst invent",
    "Either to please me, or torment:",
    "For thou alone to people me,",
    "Art grown a numerous colony;",
    "And a collection choicer far",
    "Than or Whitehall\u2019s or Mantua\u2019s were.",
    "But, of these pictures and the rest,",
    "That at the entrance likes me best:",
    "Where the same posture, and the look",
    "Remains, with which I first was took:",
    "A tender shepherdess, whose hair",
    "Hangs loosely playing in the air,",
    "Transplanting flowers from the green hill,",
    "To crown her head, and bosom fill."

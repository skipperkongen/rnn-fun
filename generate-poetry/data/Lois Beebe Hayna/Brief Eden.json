    "For part of one strange year we lived",
    "in a small house at the edge of a wood.",
    "No neighbors, which suited us. Nobody",
    "to ask questions. Except",
    "for the one big question we went on",
    "asking ourselves.",
    "That spring",
    "myriads of birds stopped over",
    "briefly. Birds we\u2019d never seen before, drawn",
    "to our leafy quiet and our brook and because,",
    "as we later learned, the place lay beneath",
    "a flyway. Flocks appeared overnight\u2014birds",
    "brilliant or dull, with sharp beaks",
    "or crossed bills, birds small",
    "and enormous, all of them pausing",
    "to gorge at the feeder, to rest their wings,",
    "and disappear. Each flock seemed surer than we",
    "of a destination. By the time we\u2019d watched them",
    "wing north in spring, then make",
    "an anxious autumn return,",
    "we too had pulled it together and we too moved",
    "into what seemed to be our lives."

    "She hears with dread the repulsive wave\u2019s approach",
    "and her fifty-year-old body smothers under water.",
    "An old man loses half his weight, as if by stealth,",
    "but finds in his shed his great-grandfather\u2019s knobbly cane,",
    "and hobbles toward youth beside the pond\u2019s swart water.",
    "She listens to the dun-colored whippoorwill\u2019s",
    "three-beat before dawn, and again when dusk",
    "enters the cornfield parched and wanting water.",
    "He imagines but cannot bring himself to believe",
    "that the dead woman enters his house disguised",
    "or that the young rabbi made",
    "Within the poem he and she\u2014hot, cold, and luke\u2014",
    "converge into flesh of vowels and consonant bones",
    "or into uncanny affection of earth for water."

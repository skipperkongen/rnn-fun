    "In October of the year,",
    "he counts potatoes dug from the brown field,",
    "counting the seed, counting",
    "the cellar\u2019s portion out,",
    "and bags the rest on the cart\u2019s floor.",
    "He packs wool sheared in April, honey",
    "in combs, linen, leather",
    "tanned from deerhide,",
    "and vinegar in a barrel",
    "hooped by hand at the forge\u2019s fire.",
    "He walks by his ox\u2019s head, ten days",
    "to Portsmouth Market, and sells potatoes,",
    "and the bag that carried potatoes,",
    "flaxseed, birch brooms, maple sugar, goose",
    "feathers, yarn.",
    "When the cart is empty he sells the cart.",
    "When the cart is sold he sells the ox,",
    "harness and yoke, and walks",
    "home, his pockets heavy",
    "with the year\u2019s coin for salt and taxes,",
    "and at home by fire\u2019s light in November cold",
    "stitches new harness",
    "for next year\u2019s ox in the barn,",
    "and carves the yoke, and saws planks",
    "building the cart again."

    "They are thin",
    "and rarely marry, living out",
    "their long lives",
    "in spacious rooms, French doors",
    "giving view to formal gardens",
    "where aromatic flowers",
    "grow in profusion.",
    "They play their pianos",
    "in the late afternoon",
    "tilting their heads",
    "at a gracious angle",
    "as if listening",
    "to notes pitched above",
    "the human range.",
    "Age makes them translucent;",
    "each palpitation of their hearts",
    "visible at temple or neck.",
    "When they die, it\u2019s in their sleep,",
    "their spirits shaking gently loose",
    "from a hostess too well bred",
    "to protest."

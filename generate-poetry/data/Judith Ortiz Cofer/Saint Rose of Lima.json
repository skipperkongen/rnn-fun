    "ISABEL DE FLORES",
    "She was the joke of the angels\u2014a girl",
    "crazy enough for God",
    "that she despised her own beauty; who grew bitter herbs",
    "to mix with her food,",
    "who pinned a garland of roses to her forehead;",
    "and who, in a fury of desire",
    "concocted a potion of Indian pepper and bark",
    "and rubbed it on her face, neck, and breasts,",
    "disfiguring herself.",
    "Then, locked away in a dark cell,",
    "where no reflection was possible,",
    "she begged for death to join her with her Master",
    "whom she called",
    "in My Heart, Eternal Spouse.",
    "She would see His vague outline, feel His cool touch",
    "on her fevered brow,",
    "but as relief came, her vision would begin to fade,",
    "and once again she would dip the iron bar into the coals,",
    "and pass it gently like a magician\u2019s wand over her skin\u2014",
    "to feel the passion that flames for a moment,",
    "in all dying things."

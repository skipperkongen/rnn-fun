    "Be sad, be cool, be kind,",
    "remembering those now dreamdust",
    "hallowed in the ruts and gullies,",
    "solemn bones under the smooth blue sea,",
    "faces warblown in a falling rain.",
    "Be a brother, if so can be,",
    "to those beyond battle fatigue",
    "each in his own corner of earth",
    "or forty fathoms undersea",
    "beyond all boom of guns,",
    "beyond any bong of a great bell,",
    "each with a bosom and number,",
    "each with a pack of secrets,",
    "each with a personal dream and doorway",
    "and over them now the long endless winds",
    "with the low healing song of time,",
    "the hush and sleep murmur of time.",
    "Make your wit a guard and cover.",
    "Sing low, sing high, sing wide.",
    "Let your laughter come free",
    "remembering looking toward peace:",
    "\u201cWe must disenthrall ourselves.\u201d",
    "Be a brother, if so can be,",
    "to those thrown forward",
    "for taking hardwon lines,",
    "for holding hardwon points",
    "and their reward so-so,",
    "little they care to talk about,",
    "their pay held in a mute calm,",
    "highspot memories going unspoken,",
    "what they did being past words,",
    "what they took being hardwon.",
    "Be sad, be kind, be cool.",
    "Weep if you must",
    "And weep open and shameless",
    "before these altars.",
    "There are wounds past words.",
    "There are cripples less broken",
    "than many who walk whole.",
    "There are dead youths",
    "with wrists of silence",
    "who keep a vast music",
    "under their shut lips,",
    "what they did being past words,",
    "their dreams like their deaths",
    "beyond any smooth and easy telling,",
    "having given till no more to give.",
    "There is dust alive",
    "with dreams of The Republic,",
    "with dreams of the Family of Man",
    "flung wide on a shrinking globe",
    "with old timetables,",
    "old maps, old guide-posts",
    "torn into shreds,",
    "shot into tatters",
    "burnt in a firewind,",
    "lost in the shambles,",
    "faded in rubble and ashes.",
    "There is dust alive.",
    "Out of a granite tomb,",
    "Out of a bronze sarcophagus,",
    "Loose from the stone and copper",
    "Steps a whitesmoke ghost",
    "Lifting an authoritative hand",
    "In the name of dreams worth dying for,",
    "In the name of men whose dust breathes",
    "of those dreams so worth dying for,",
    "what they did being past words,",
    "beyond all smooth and easy telling.",
    "Be sad, be kind, be cool,",
    "remembering, under God, a dreamdust",
    "hallowed in the ruts and gullies,",
    "solemn bones under the smooth blue sea,",
    "faces warblown in a falling rain.",
    "Sing low, sing high, sing wide.",
    "Make your wit a guard and cover.",
    "Let your laughter come free",
    "like a help and a brace of comfort.",
    "The earth laughs, the sun laughs",
    "over every wise harvest of man,",
    "over man looking toward peace",
    "by the light of the hard old teaching:",
    "\u201cWe must disenthrall ourselves.\u201d"

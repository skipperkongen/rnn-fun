    "My head knocks against the stars.",

    "I have been to hell and back many times.",
    "I know all about heaven, for I have talked with God.",
    "I dabble in the blood and guts of the terrible.",
    "I know the passionate seizure of beauty",
    "And the marvelous rebellion of man at all signs reading \"Keep Off.\"",
    "My name is Truth and I am the most elusive captive in the universe."

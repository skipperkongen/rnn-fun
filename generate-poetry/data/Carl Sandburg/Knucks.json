    "In Abraham Lincoln\u2019s city,",

    "Wrapped in the smoke of memories",
    "From Tallahassee to the Yukon,",
    "The place now where the shaft of his tomb",
    "Points white against the blue prairie dome,",
    "In Abraham Lincoln\u2019s city ... I saw knucks",
    "In the window of Mister Fischman\u2019s second-hand store",

    "\u201cThirty cents apiece,\u201d answered Mister Fischman.",
    "And taking a box of new ones off a shelf",
    "He filled anew the box in the showcase",
    "And said incidentally, most casually",
    "And incidentally:",
    "\u201cI sell a carload a month of these.\u201d",
    "I slipped my fingers into a set of knucks,",
    "Cast-iron knucks molded in a foundry pattern,",
    "And there came to me a set of thoughts like these:",
    "Mister Fischman is for Abe and the \u201cmalice to none\u201d stuff,",
    "And the street car strikers and the strike-breakers,",
    "And the sluggers, gunmen, detectives, policemen,",
    "Judges, utility heads, newspapers, priests, lawyers,",
    "They are all for Abe and the \u201cmalice to none\u201d stuff.",
    "I started for the door.",
    "\u201cMaybe you want a lighter pair,\u201d",
    "Came Mister Fischman\u2019s voice.",
    "I opened the door ... and the voice again:",
    "\u201cYou are a funny customer.\u201d",
    "Wrapped in battle flags,",
    "Wrapped in the smoke of memories,",
    "This is the place they brought him,",
    "This is Abraham Lincoln's home town."

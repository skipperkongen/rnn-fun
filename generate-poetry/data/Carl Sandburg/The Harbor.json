    "Passing through huddled and ugly walls,",
    "By doorways where women haggard",
    "Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,",
    "Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,",
    "Out from the huddled and ugly walls,",
    "I came sudden, at the city's edge,",
    "On a blue burst of lake,",
    "Long lake waves breaking under the sun",
    "On a spray-flung curve of shore;",
    "And a fluttering storm of gulls,",
    "Masses of great gray wings",
    "And flying white bellies",
    "Veering and wheeling free in the open."

    "Your bow swept over a string, and a long low note quivered to the air.",
    "(A mother of Bohemia sobs over a new child perfect learning to suck milk.)",
    "Your bow ran fast over all the high strings fluttering and wild.",
    "(All the girls in Bohemia are laughing on a Sunday afternoon in the hills with their lovers.)"

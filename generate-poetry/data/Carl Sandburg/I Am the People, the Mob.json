    "the people\u2014the mob\u2014the crowd\u2014the mass.",
    "Do you know that all the great work of the world is done through me?",
    "I am the workingman, the inventor, the maker of the world\u2019s food and clothes.",
    "I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons come from me and the Lincolns. They die. And then I send forth more Napoleons and Lincolns.",
    "I am the seed ground. I am a prairie that will stand for much plowing. Terrible storms pass over me. I forget. The best of me is sucked out and wasted. I forget. Everything but Death comes to me and makes me work and give up what I have. And I forget.",
    "Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red drops for history to remember. Then\u2014I forget.",
    "When I, the People, learn to remember, when I, the People, use the lessons of yesterday and no longer forget who robbed me last year, who played me for a fool\u2014then there will be no speaker in all the world say the name: \u201cThe People,\u201d with any fleck of a sneer in his voice or any far-off smile of derision.",
    "The mob\u2014the crowd\u2014the mass\u2014will arrive then."

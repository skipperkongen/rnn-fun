    "O",
    "my city the worst that men will ever say is this:",
    "You took little children away from the sun and the dew,",
    "And the glimmers that played in the grass under the great sky,",
    "And the reckless rain; you put them between walls",
    "To work, broken and smothered, for bread and wages,",
    "To eat dust in their throats and die empty-hearted",
    "For a little handful of pay on a few Saturday nights."

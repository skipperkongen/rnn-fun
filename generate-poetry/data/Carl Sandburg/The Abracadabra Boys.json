    "The abracadabra boys\u2014have they been in the stacks and cloisters? Have they picked up languages for throwing into chow mein poems?",
    "Have they been to a sea of jargons and brought back jargons? Their salutations go: Who cometh? and, It ith I cometh.",
    "They know postures from impostures, pistils from pustules, to hear them tell it. They foregather and make pitty pat with each other in Latin and in their private pig Latin, very ofay.",
    "They give with passwords. \u201cWho cometh?\u201d \u201cA kumquat cometh.\u201d \u201cAnd how cometh the kumquat?\u201d \u201cOn an abbadabba, ancient and honorable sire, ever and ever on an abbadabba.\u201d",
    "Do they have fun? Sure\u2014their fun is being what they are, like our fun is being what we are\u2014only they are more sorry for us being what we are than we are for them being what they are.",
    "Pointing at you, at us, at the rabble, they sigh and say, these abracadabra boys, \u201cThey lack jargons. They fail to distinguish between pustules and pistils. They knoweth not how the kumquat cometh.\u201d"

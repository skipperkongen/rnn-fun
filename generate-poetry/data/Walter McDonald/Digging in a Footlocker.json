    "Crouched before dismantled guns,",
    "we found war souvenirs",
    "our uncle padlocked in the attic,",
    "a brittle latch easily pried off.",
    "Stiff uniforms on top, snapshots",
    "of soldiers young as our cousins,",
    "a velvet box of medals",
    "as if he fought all battles",
    "in World War II. Bayonets, machetes,",
    "a folded flag, two hand grenades",
    "with missing pins. We picked up teeth",
    "like pennies, loose, as if tossed in,",
    "a piece of something dark and waxy",
    "like a fig, curved like a question mark,",
    "a human ear. We touched dried pieces",
    "of cloth stuck to curved bones",
    "and held them to the light,",
    "turning them over and over, wondering",
    "how did uncles learn to kill,",
    "what would happen when we grew up."

    "Barbed wires on rusted nails can\u2019t hold",
    "lone bulls at home when they smell pasture.",
    "They thrust their bone skulls under barbs,",
    "tongues quivering for a taste of strange",
    "and shove until the post gives way. Days later,",
    "we find wires sagging, reset the post,",
    "and tighten bent wires like a fiddle",
    "and rope the worn-out bull,",
    "wishing there was only a fence",
    "between us and our heart\u2019s desire.",
    "But something with spurs and a rope",
    "would find us, cursing and yelling on horseback,",
    "cutting us from escape down arroyos,",
    "dragging us frothing and wild-eyed",
    "back to the sun-bleached yellow range,",
    "the same whirlpool of buzzards."

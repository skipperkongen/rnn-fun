    "You take off your black",
    "motorcycle jacket, hang it",
    "on the back of a chair. It\u2019s cold",
    "from our walk along the sea wall.",
    "Your pockets jingle with shells.",
    "While we were gone, you left",
    "the stove on low\u2014some things",
    "you do make me so nervous.",
    "You graze the surface of sauce",
    "simmering in a pan, shiny fingertip",
    "held out for me to lick, you say",
    "\u201cWhat does it need?\u201d Maybe nothing,",
    "maybe honey to unbitter the lime.",
    "Later that night you\u2019ll bury your face",

    "though I don\u2019t think you are",
    "always talking to me, my love.",
    "But now lobster steam billows",
    "up the window, you gulp",
    "purple wine, your pinky sticking out,",
    "and the round olives are the green",
    "all green things aspire to be."

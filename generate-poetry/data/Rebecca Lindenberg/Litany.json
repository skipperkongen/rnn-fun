    "O you gods, you long-limbed animals, you",
    "astride the sea and you unhammocked",

    "chasten me with waking, humble me",
    "for wonder again. Seed god and husk god,",
    "god of the open palm, you know me, you",
    "know my mettle. See, my wrists are small.",
    "O you, with glass-colored wind at your call",
    "and you, whose voice is soft as a turned page,",

    "a word that means what I would ask him for",
    "so when he says: You give it all away,",
    "I can say: I am not sorry. I sing."

    "A crazed sizzle of blazing bees",
    "in the word EAT. Beyond it,",
    "thousands of stars have faded",
    "like deserted flowers in the thin",
    "light washing up in the distance,",
    "flooding the snowy mountains",
    "bluff by bluff. Moments later,",
    "the sign blinks, winks dark,",
    "and a white-aproned cook\u2014",
    "surfacing in the murky sheen",
    "of the window\u2014leans awhile",
    "like a cut lily . . . staring out",
    "into the famished blankness",
    "he knows he must go home to."

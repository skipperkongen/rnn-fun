    "One by one, like guests at a late party",
    "They shake our hands and step into the dark:",
    "One by one, like sheep counted to close our eyes,",
    "They leap the fence and disappear into the woods:",
    "Great auk; Dodo; Eastern wapiti; Badlands bighorn sheep.",
    "One by one, like grade school friends,",
    "They move away and fade out of memory:",
    "Spanish imperial eagle; Japanese wolf; Hawksbill",
    "Sea turtle; Cape lion; Heath hen; Raiatea thrush.",
    "One by one, like children at a fire drill, they march outside,",
    "And keep marching, though teachers cry, \u201cCome back!\u201d",
    "Pygmy chimpanzee; Australian night parrot;",
    "Turquoise parakeet; Indian cheetah; Korean tiger;",
    "Eastern harbor seal ; Ceylon elephant ; Great Indian rhinoceros.",
    "One by one, like actors in a play that ran for years",
    "And wowed the world, they link their hands and bow",
    "Before the curtain falls."

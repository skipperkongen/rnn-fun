    "and we caught our first fish of the year?",
    "Or would you remember that time off Cape Flattery",
    "when you were a little girl:",
    "your father smoking, telling stories as he ran the boat,",
    "then the tug and zing of that very first fish",
    "spooling off into the gray-green world;",
    "you laughing and brushing back your hair",
    "before setting the hook?",
    "I know I am hard to understand sometimes",
    "particularly when you are standing",
    "at the post office with only a piece of paper",
    "saying \u201cking salmon\u201d on it",
    "but just think of it as a promissary note",
    "and that electric tug, that thrill",
    "pulling your mind into deep water",
    "is how I feel about you every,",
    "single day."

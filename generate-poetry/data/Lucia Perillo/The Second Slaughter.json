    "behind the heels and drags it",
    "behind his chariot like the cans that trail",
    "a bride and groom. Then he lays out",
    "a banquet for his men, oxen and goats",
    "and pigs and sheep; the soldiers eat",
    "until a greasy moonbeam lights their beards.",
    "The first slaughter is for victory, but the second slaughter is for grief\u2014",
    "for burning with the body of the friend. But Achilles finds",
    "no consolation in the hiss and crackle of their fat;",
    "not even heaving four stallions on the pyre",
    "can lift the ballast of his sorrow.",
    "And here I turn my back on the epic hero",
    "the throats of his friend\u2019s dogs,",
    "killing what the loved one loved",
    "to reverse the polarity of grief. Let him repent",
    "by vanishing from my concern",
    "after he throws the dogs onto the fire.",
    "The singed fur makes the air too difficult to breathe.",
    "When the oil wells of Persia burned I did not weep",
    "until I heard about the birds, the long-legged ones especially",
    "which I imagined to be scarlet, with crests like egrets",
    "and tails like peacocks, covered in tar",
    "weighting the feathers they dragged through black shallows",
    "at the rim of the marsh. But once",
    "I told this to a man who said I was inhuman, for giving animals",
    "my first lament. So now I guard",
    "my inhumanity like the jackal",
    "who appears behind the army base at dusk,",
    "come there for scraps with his head lowered",
    "in a posture that looks like appeasement,",
    "though it is not."

    "The old woman in the parking lot",
    "wields her walker not unspryly. Gray hair",

    "windbreaker, windbreaker. She rolls up",
    "to watch me board, as people do,",

    "to see the wheelchair maneuvered backward",
    "into the van.",
    "she asks, as people do",
    "though I am not their child.",

    "despite the wind\u2019s ruffling our skirts in sync\u2014",
    "oh how she is interested in the ruffling of my skirt.",
    "The ruffle makes her giddy, starts",
    "her bald gums racing on their wordless observations",
    "as she peers into my thighs.",
    "says this",
    "no-sister of mine to be argued with,",
    "just some crazy old woman",
    "flashing the terrible crater of her smile",
    "to raise the wind and",
    "prove her point."

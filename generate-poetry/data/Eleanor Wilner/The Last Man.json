    "Here, in our familiar streets, the day",
    "is brisk with winter\u2019s business.",
    "The reassuring rows of brick fa\u00e7ades,",
    "litter baskets overflowing",
    "with the harvest of the streets",
    "and, when the light turns, the people",
    "move in unison, the cars miraculously",
    "slide to a stop, no one is killed,",
    "the streets, for some reason, do not",
    "show the blood that is pouring",
    "like a tide, on other shores.",
    "Martinez, the last peasant left alive",
    "in his village, refuses to run, hopes",
    "that God,",
    "will let him get the harvest in.",
    "\u201cCan a fish live out of water?\u201d he says",
    "for why he stays, and weeds",
    "another row, ignoring the fins",
    "of sharks that push up",
    "through the furrows.",
    "Here, it is said, we live",
    "in the belly of the beast. Ahab sits",
    "forever at the helm, his skin",
    "white wax, an effigy. The whale carries",
    "him, lashed to its side by the ropes",
    "from his own harpoon. His eyes",
    "are dead. His ivory leg",
    "juts from the flank of Leviathan",
    "like a useless tooth.",
    "One more time, the distant sail appears,",
    "a cloud forms, an old icon for mercy",
    "turned up in a dusty corner",
    "of the sky, preparing rain",
    "for the parched land, Rachel",
    "weeping for her children. \u201cCan a fish",
    "live out of water?\u201d he asks",
    "and the rain answers, in Spanish,",
    "little hands of silver on his brow."

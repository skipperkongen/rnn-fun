    "The landings had gone wrong; white silk,",
    "like shrouds, covered the woods.",
    "The trees had trapped the flimsy fabric",
    "in their web\u2014everywhere the harnessed bodies",
    "hung\u2014helpless, treading air",
    "like water.",
    "We thought to float down",
    "easily\u2014a simple thing",
    "like coming home: feet first,",
    "a welcome from the waiting fields,",
    "a gentle fall in clover.",
    "We hadn\u2019t counted on this",
    "wilderness, the gusts of wind",
    "that took us over; we were surprised",
    "by the tenacity of branching wood,",
    "its reach, and how impenetrable",
    "the place we left, and thought we knew,",
    "could be.",
    "Sometimes now, as we sway, unwilling",
    "pendulums that mark the time,",
    "we still can dream",
    "someone will come and cut us down.",
    "There is nothing here but words, the calls",
    "we try the dark with\u2014hoping for a human",
    "ear, response, a rescue party.",
    "But all we hear is other",
    "voices like our own, other bodies",
    "tangled in the lines,",
    "the repetition of a cry from every tree:"

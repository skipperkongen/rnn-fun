    "To turn a stone",
    "with its white squirming",
    "underneath, to pry the disc",
    "from the sun\u2019s eclipse\u2014white heat",
    "coiling in the blinded eye: to these malign",
    "necessities we come",
    "from the dim time of dinosaurs",
    "who crawled like breathing lava",
    "from the earth\u2019s cracked crust, and swung",
    "their tiny heads above the lumbering tons",
    "of flesh, brains no bigger than a fist",
    "clenched to resist the white flash",
    "in the sky the day the sun-flares",
    "pared them down to relics for museums,",
    "turned glaciers back, seared Sinai\u2019s",
    "meadows black\u2014the ferns withered, the swamps",
    "were melted down to molten mud, the cells",
    "uncoupled, recombined, and madly",
    "multiplied, huge trees toppled to the ground,",
    "the slow life there abandoned hope,",
    "a caterpillar stiffened in the grass.",
    "Two apes, caught in the act of coupling,",
    "made a mutant child",
    "who woke to sunlight wondering, his mother",
    "torn by the huge new head",
    "that forced the narrow birth canal.",
    "As if compelled to repetition",
    "and to unearth again",
    "white fire at the heart of matter\u2014fire",
    "we sought and fire we spoke,",
    "our thoughts, however elegant, were fire",
    "from first to last\u2014like sentries set to watch",
    "at Argos for the signal fire",
    "passed peak to peak from Troy",
    "to Nagasaki, triumphant echo of the burning",
    "city walls and prologue to the murders",
    "yet to come\u2014we scan the sky",
    "for that bright flash,",
    "our eyes stared white from watching",
    "for the signal fire that ends",
    "the epic\u2014a cursed line",
    "with its caesura, a pause",
    "to signal peace, or a rehearsal",
    "for the silence."

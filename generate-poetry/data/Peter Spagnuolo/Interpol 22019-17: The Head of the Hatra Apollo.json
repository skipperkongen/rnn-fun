    "No light can gild the sun god\u2019s cheek but strains",
    "through burlap now, Phoibos the refugee,",
    "his head a marble cabbage in a sack",
    "jouncing east by pickup down a dirt track",
    "across Seleucid wastes, Parthian plains,",
    "once more fortune\u2019s tourist, bobbing free.",
    "Or not\u2014just stashed behind a rubbish mound",
    "where bare-boned goats might crop a scraggy meal,",
    "scant miles from the museum\u2019s shattered room.",
    "Stripped of laurels, his oracles, his loom",
    "of sacred strings, no",
    "here spin round,",
    "just pacing men who wait to close the deal.",
    "A goatherd sings, slings a Kalashnikov:",
    "the godhead mute since looters hacked it off."

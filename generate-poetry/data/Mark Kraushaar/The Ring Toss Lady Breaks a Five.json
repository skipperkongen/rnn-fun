    "It\u2019s all of it rigged, she says,",
    "Bust-one-wins, Hi-striker, even the Dozer.",
    "It\u2019s like you think you\u2019ll score that giant panda",
    "for the wife except you can\u2019t, or not",
    "without you drop another twenty",
    "and then\u2014what?\u2014then you win",
    "a thumb-sized monkey or a little comb.",
    "She hands me five ones and then stands.",
    "She\u2019s worked the whole of the midway,",
    "she says, funnel cake to corn-dogs.",
    "She\u2019s worked every game",
    "plus half the rides, Krazy Koaster,",
    "Avalanche, Wing-Ding, Tilt-a-Whirl",
    "and if there\u2019s somebody sick she\u2019ll do",
    "a kiddy ride too, Li\u2019l Choo-choo, maybe",
    "the Tea Cup.",
    "There\u2019s a collapsing soft sigh",
    "and she sits, opens the paper, turns a page",
    "and as if she were the one assigned to face forwards,",
    "as if it were her job to intuit the world",
    "and interpret the news,",
    "Anymore, she says, it\u2019s out of our hands,",
    "it\u2019s all we can do\u2014it\u2019s not up to you.",
    "You see that bald bronco tearing",
    "tickets at the carousel?",
    "We worked the Bottle-drop",
    "and now he\u2019s mine: he\u2019s no genius",
    "but he loves me and he\u2019s mine.",
    "Things happen, she says, you",
    "can\u2019t take them back."

    "there are many small wars, yet none",
    "big enough to make a real difference.",

    "called a truce for now. If this planet had a ruler,",
    "no one remembers him well. All",
    "decisions are made by committee.",
    "Yet there are a few pictures of the old dictator\u2014",
    "how youthful he looked on his big horse,",
    "how bright his eyes.",
    "He was ready to conquer the world."

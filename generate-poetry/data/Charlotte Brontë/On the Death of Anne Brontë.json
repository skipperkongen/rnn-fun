    "THERE 's little joy in life for me,",
    "And little terror in the grave;",
    "I 've lived the parting hour to see",
    "Of one I would have died to save.",
    "Calmly to watch the failing breath,",
    "Wishing each sigh might be the last;",
    "Longing to see the shade of death",
    "O'er those belov\u00e8d features cast.",
    "The cloud, the stillness that must part",
    "The darling of my life from me;",
    "And then to thank God from my heart,",
    "To thank Him well and fervently;",
    "Although I knew that we had lost",
    "The hope and glory of our life;",
    "And now, benighted, tempest-tossed,",
    "Must bear alone the weary strife."

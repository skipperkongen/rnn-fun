    "Remember the night you got drunk",
    "and shot the roses?",
    "You were a perfect stranger, Father,",
    "even my bad sister cried.",
    "Some other gravity,",
    "not death or luck,",
    "drew fish out of the sea",
    "and started them panting.",
    "The fish became a man.",
    "The archer\u2019s bow became a violin.",
    "I remember the night you searched the sofa",
    "for change",
    "and wept on the telephone.",
    "Some other gravity,",
    "not time or entropy,",
    "pulled the knife down for centuries.",
    "The archers dropped their bows,",
    "harmless as pine needles in the snow.",
    "The knife became a plow",
    "and entered the earth, Father.",
    "Later it became a boat",
    "and some other things \u2014",
    "It isn\u2019t a dream but it takes a long time,",
    "for the archer\u2019s bow to become a violin."

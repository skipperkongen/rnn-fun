    "He held her head up out of the mud",
    "And said how he was sorry",
    "Till they came to pull him out.",
    "We found the white filly",
    "On the only hard ground by the south gate.",

    "He told us somewhere on Sand Creek Pass",
    "Was a crystal that spelled our own initials",
    "And we should try to find it.",
    "We walked through sagebrush and sand currents, looking.",

    "Wait till Easter to grow,",
    "Then they come up even with snow still on the ground.",

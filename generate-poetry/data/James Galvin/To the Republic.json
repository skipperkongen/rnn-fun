    "fences the first sheepmen cast across the land, processions",
    "of cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishing",

    "ballads Ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught",
    "me the ends if he could have remembered them.",
    "But remembering",
    "was years ago when Ray swamped for ranches at a dollar a day",
    "and found, and played guitar in a Saturday night band, and now",
    "he is dead and I\u2019m remembering near the end when he just needed",
    "a drink before he could tie his shoes.",
    "We\u2019d stay up all night",
    "playing the beginnings of songs like",

    "pawed the light out of the moon.",
    "Sometimes Ray would break",
    "through and recall a few more verses before he\u2019d drop a line",
    "or scramble a rhyme or just go blank, and his workfat hands",
    "would drop the chords and fall away in disbelief.",
    "Between",
    "songs he\u2019d pull on the rum or unleash coughing fits that",
    "sounded like nails in a paper bag.",

    ", and",
    "light the Parliament he bit at an upward angle like Roosevelt",
    "and play the start of another song.",
    "Then, played out and",
    "drunk enough to go home, he\u2019d pick up his hat and case and",
    "make it, usually on the second try, through the front gate",
    "and gently list out into the early morning dark, beginning",
    "again some song without end, yodeling his vote under spangles."

    "1.",
    "That woman still lives at her ranch.",
    "You can ask her. Maybe",
    "She knows. As near and far",
    "As the rest of us can tell",
    "The barn and sheds were built",
    "In the Great Depression. Someone",
    "Had money and a big idea.",
    "Far and away the biggest",
    "Idea I\u2019ve ever seen.",
    "Pat says there must\u2019ve been",
    "A hundred men, shepherds",
    "And shearers, working there.",
    "It\u2019s one of those things",
    "That not only is, but seems,",
    "Larger inside than out,",
    "Like a planetarium or an orange,",
    "Even with Wyoming around it,",
    "And real stars flying away.",
    "Just stick your head in there;",
    "Its dark will make you dizzy.",
    "It has an underneath",
    "Too low to stand in unless",
    "You are a sheep. The loft",
    "Vaults like a dusky church.",
    "2.",
    "All that summer",
    "I balanced water,",
    "Coaxing the desert",
    "Into pasture,",
    "With eight cubic feet",
    "Per second for two",
    "Thousand acres.",
    "Horseback, shovel",
    "On my shoulder along",
    "Miles of ditches:",
    "Stalling here,",
    "Releasing there,",
    "Water over",
    "The deepening green,",
    "Keeping it living:",
    "Herons and cranes",
    "Regal in meadows,",
    "Strings of ducklings",
    "Frothing the ditch",
    "To get away.",
    "3.",
    "One day riding ditches I saw Clay.",
    "He was on the hill against the sky,",
    "Flapping his arms at me.",
    "They were going to bulldoze the corrals at the shearing sheds,",
    "Intricate maze of gates and pens",
    "Clay, as a kid, had built with his father,",
    "Before they lost their ranch, before Frank died,",
    "Before the family had to move away.",
    "The new owner was razing everything.",
    "I guess he had some kind of idea.",
    "Clay didn\u2019t need any gates, but, as Pat said,",
    "That\u2019s Clay.",
    "I met them at the shearing sheds.",
    "Pat held a wrecking bar like a steel snake.",
    "he said, looking shy.",
    "4.",
    "On the barn roof a loose piece of tin",
    "Flaps in the wind like a broken wing.",
    "Wyoming whirls in the sun.",
    "Up in the loft a pair of shears,",
    "Oh, fifty or sixty years forgotten there,",
    "Floats in noonlight, bearing up some dust,",
    "Just a pair of spring-steel scissors,",
    "Two knives joined at the hip, with smiling edges.",
    "An owl the color of things left alone",
    "Flaps out of the gable door.",
    "Hell is when you know where you are:",
    "Mazes of pens and gates dreaming sheep;",
    "Miles of ditches dreaming green.",
    "5.",
    "No one living knows",
    "Who built the shearing sheds,",
    "Unless maybe that woman,",
    "And I\u2019m not about to ask her,",
    "Ever since she tried",
    "To stab her husband with a pair of scissors.",
    "He was ninety-one",
    "And barely held her off.",
    "Later she claimed she was just",
    "Trying to cut his heart",
    "Medication out of his shirt",
    "Pocket \u2014 dope, she called it \u2014",
    "And the old man had to leave",
    "The ranch, where he didn\u2019t last long.",
    "They bulldozed the corrals.",
    "We got forty gates.",
    "We took them someplace safe.",
    "6.",
    "Now the vast, dim barn floats like an ocean liner",
    "Whose doldrums are meadows spinning into brush,",
    "And everywhere you look Wyoming hurries off.",
    "All night the stars make their escape.",
    "In the loft a pair of shears cuts woolly moonlight.",
    "All day a piece of roofing slaps in the wind.",
    "A startled owl flaps out of the gable.",
    "Hell is when you know where you are and it\u2019s beautiful.",
    "You saved the gates for nothing.",
    "You balanced the water to keep the green from spinning",
    "Away into sage, the same gray as the wing",
    "That just now shaded your eyes."

    "Where I live distance is the primal fact",
    "The world is mostly far away and small",
    "Drifting along through cause and effect like sleep",
    "As when the distance unlikeliest of stems",
    "Bears the unlikely blossom of the wind",
    "Engendering our only weather dry",
    "Except in winter pine trees live on snow",
    "So greedy pulling down these drifts that bury",
    "The fences snap the trunks of smaller trees",
    "If the forest wants to go somewhere it spreads",
    "Like a prophecy its snow before it",
    "Technology a distant windy cause",
    "There is no philosophy of death where I live",
    "Only philosophies of suffering"

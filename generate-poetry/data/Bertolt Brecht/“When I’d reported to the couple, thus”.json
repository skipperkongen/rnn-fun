    "When I\u2019d reported to the couple, thus",
    "That up there no one murders now for gain",
    "Since no one owns a thing, the faithless spouse",
    "Who\u2019d beguiled that woman so improperly",
    "Lifted his hand, now tied to hers by chains",
    "And looked at her and turned perplexed to me",
    "So no one steals, if there\u2019s no property?",
    "I shook my head. And as their hands just touched",
    "I saw a blush suffuse the woman\u2019s cheeks.",
    "He saw it too and cried, She hasn\u2019t once",
    "Shown so much since the day she was seduced!",
    "And murmuring, Then there\u2019s no abstinence?",
    "They moved off swiftly. And the ties that fused",
    "Them tight were of no weight or consequence."

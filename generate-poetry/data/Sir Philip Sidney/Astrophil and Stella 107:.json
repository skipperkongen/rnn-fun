    "Stella, since thou so right a princess art",
    "Of all the powers which life bestows on me,",
    "There ere by them aught undertaken be",
    "They first resort unto that sovereign part;",
    "Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart,",
    "Which pants as though it still should leap to thee,",
    "And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy",
    "To this great cause, which needs both use and art,",
    "And as a queen, who from her presence sends",
    "Whom she employs, dismiss from thee my wit,",
    "Till it have wrought what thy own will attends.",
    "On servants\u2019 shame oft master\u2019s blame doth sit.",
    "Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove,",
    "And scorning say, \u201cSee what it is to love.\u201d"

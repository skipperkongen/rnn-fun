    "Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",
    "That the dear She might take some pleasure of my pain,",
    "Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",
    "Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,\u2014",
    "I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,",
    "Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,",
    "Oft turning others\u2019 leaves, to see if thence would flow",
    "Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.",
    "But words came halting forth, wanting Invention\u2019s stay:",
    "Invention, Nature\u2019s child, fled step-dame Study\u2019s blows,",
    "And others\u2019 feet still seemed but strangers in my way.",
    "Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,",
    "Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:",
    "\u201cFool,\u201d said my Muse to me, \u201clook in thy heart and write.\u201d",

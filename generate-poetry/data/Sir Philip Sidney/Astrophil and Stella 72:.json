    "Desire, though thou my old companion art,",
    "And oft so clings to my pure Love that I",
    "One from the other scarcely can descry,",
    "While each doth blow the fire of my heart,",
    "Now from thy fellowship I needs must part;",
    "Venus is taught with Dian\u2019s wings to fly;",
    "I must no more in thy sweet passions lie;",
    "Virtue\u2019s gold now must head my Cupid\u2019s dart.",
    "Service and honor, wonder with delight,",
    "Fear to offend, will worthy to appear,",
    "Care shining in mine eyes, faith in my sprite:",
    "These things are let me by my only dear;",
    "But thou, Desire, because thou wouldst have all,",
    "Now banished art. But yet alas how shall?"

    "A strife is grown between Virtue and Love,",
    "While each pretends that Stella must be his:",
    "Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love, do this,",
    "Since they do wear his badge, most firmly prove.",
    "But Virtue thus that title doth disprove,",
    "That Stella (O dear name) that Stella is",
    "That virtuous soul, sure heir of heav\u2019nly bliss;",
    "Not this fair outside, which our hearts doth move.",
    "And therefore, though her beauty and her grace",
    "Be Love\u2019s indeed, in Stella\u2019s self he may",
    "By no pretense claim any manner place.",
    "Well, Love, since this demur our suit doth stay,",
    "Let Virtue have that Stella's self; yet thus,",
    "Let Virtue but that body grant to us."

    "It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve",

    "And, fools, adore in temple of our heart,",
    "Till that good god make Church and churchman starve.",
    "True, that true beauty virtue is indeed,",
    "Whereof this beauty can be but a shade,",
    "Which elements with mortal mixture breed;",
    "True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made,",
    "And should in soul up to our country move;",
    "True; and yet true, that I must Stella love."

    "The wisest scholar of the wight most wise",
    "By Phoebus\u2019 doom, with sugared sentence says",
    "That Virtue, if it once met with our eyes,",
    "Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise;",
    "But, for that man with pain this truth descries,",
    "While he each thing in sense\u2019s balance weighs,",
    "And so nor will nor can behold those skies",
    "Which inward sun to heroic mind displays,",
    "Virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir",
    "Love of herself, takes Stella\u2019s shape, that she",
    "To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her.",
    "It is most true, for since I her did see,",
    "Virtue\u2019s great beauty in that face I prove,",
    "And find th\u2019effect, for I do burn in love."

    "Only joy, now here you are,",
    "Fit to hear and ease my care;",
    "Let my whispering voice obtain,",
    "Sweet reward for sharpest pain;",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "Night hath closed all in her cloak,",
    "Twinkling stars love-thoughts provoke:",
    "Danger hence good care doth keep,",
    "Jealousy itself doth sleep;",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "Better place no wit can find,",
    "Cupid\u2019s yoke to loose or bind:",
    "These sweet flowers on fine bed too,",
    "Us in their best language woo;",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "This small light the moon bestows,",
    "Serves thy beams but to disclose,",
    "So to raise my hap more high;",
    "Fear not else, none can us spy:",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "That you heard was but a mouse,",
    "Dumb sleep holdeth all the house;",
    "Yet asleep, methinks they say,",
    "Young folks, take time while you may:",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "Niggard Time threats, if we miss",
    "This large offer of our bliss,",
    "Long stay ere he grant the same;",
    "Sweet then, while each thing doth frame,",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "Your fair mother is abed,",
    "Candles out, and curtains spread:",
    "She thinks you do letters write.",
    "Write, but first let me indite:",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "Sweet, alas, why strive you thus?",
    "Concord better fitteth us:",
    "Leave to Mars the force of hands,",
    "Your power in your beauty stands;",
    "Take me to thee, and thee to me.",
    "Woe to me, and do you swear",
    "Me to hate, but I forbear,",
    "Curs\u00e8d by my destines all",
    "That brought me so high to fall:",
    "Soon with my death I will please thee."

    "Graved in mine epitaph a Poet\u2019s name:",
    "Nay if I would, could I just title make,",
    "That any laud to me thereof should grow,",
    "Without my plumes from others\u2019 wings I take.",
    "For nothing from my wit or will doth flow,",
    "Since all my words thy beauty doth endite,",
    "And love doth hold my hand, and makes me write."

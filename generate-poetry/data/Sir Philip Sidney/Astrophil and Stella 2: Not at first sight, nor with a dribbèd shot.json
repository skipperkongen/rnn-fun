    "Not at first sight, nor with a dribb\u00e8d shot,",
    "Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed:",
    "But known worth did in mine of time proceed,",
    "Till by degrees it had full conquest got.",
    "I saw, and liked; I liked, but lov\u00e8d not;",
    "I loved, but straight did not what love decreed:",
    "At length to love\u2019s decrees I, forced, agreed,",
    "Yet with repining at so partial lot.",
    "Now even that footstep of lost liberty",
    "Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite",
    "I call it praise to suffer tyranny;",
    "And now employ the remnant of my wit",
    "To make myself believe that all is well,",
    "While with a feeling skill I paint my hell."

    "What, have I thus betrayed my liberty?",
    "Can those black beams such burning marks engrave",
    "In my free side? or am I born a slave,",
    "Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny?",
    "Or want I sense to feel my misery?",
    "Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have?",
    "Who for long faith, though daily help I crave,",
    "May get no alms but scorn of beggary.",
    "Virtue, awake! Beauty but beauty is;",
    "I may, I must, I can, I will, I do",
    "Leave following that which it is gain to miss.",
    "Let her go. Soft, but here she comes. Go to,",
    "Unkind, I love you not! O me, that eye",
    "Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie!"

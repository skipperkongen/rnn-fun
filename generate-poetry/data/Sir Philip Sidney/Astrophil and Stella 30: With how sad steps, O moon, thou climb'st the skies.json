    "With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb\u2019st the skies!",
    "How silently, and with how wan a face!",
    "What! may it be that even in heavenly place",
    "That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?",
    "Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes",
    "Can judge of love, thou feel\u2019st a lover\u2019s case:",
    "I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace",
    "To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",
    "Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",
    "Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?",
    "Are beauties there as proud as here they be?",
    "Do they above love to be loved, and yet",
    "Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?",
    "Do they call \u2018virtue\u2019 there\u2014ungratefulness?"

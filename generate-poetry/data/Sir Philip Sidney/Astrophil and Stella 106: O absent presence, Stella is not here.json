    "O absent presence, Stella is not here;",
    "False flattering hope, that with so fair a face",
    "Bare me in hand, that in this orphan place",
    "Stella, I say my Stella, should appear.",
    "What say\u2019st thou now? Where is that dainty cheer",
    "Thou told\u2019st mine eyes should help their famished case?",
    "But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace",
    "Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near.",
    "But here I do store of fair ladies meet,",
    "Who may with charm of conversation sweet",
    "Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow:",
    "Sure they prevail as much with me, as he",
    "That bade his friend, but then new maimed, to be",
    "Merry with him, and not think of his woe."

    "Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies",
    "Sweetness, that breathes and pants as oft as she;",
    "And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries",
    "That sickness brags itself best graced to be.",
    "Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise",
    "That in that paleness beauty\u2019s white we see;",
    "And joy, which is inseparate from these eyes,",
    "Stella now learns (strange case!) to weep in thee.",
    "Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page,",
    "As thy looks stir, runs up and down, to make",
    "All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage;",
    "Nature with care sweats for her darling\u2019s sake,",
    "Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find",
    "Of such heaven stuff, to clothe so heavenly mind."

    "I went to my mother\u2019s room at 13",
    "past midnight, and told her I was dying.",
    "I\u2019d wet the bed, I\u2019d had this crazy dream,",
    "about a sexy neighbor I\u2019d been spying",
    "on. Well, I didn\u2019t tell her that. I mean,",
    "the day before she asked who I was eyeing",
    "when I didn\u2019t want to go outside",
    "for ice cream. The truck was parked out front,",
    "and she was buying, but I couldn\u2019t join",
    "the other screaming kids \u2014",
    "not with Lance applying suntan lotion",
    "to his muscled teenage skin.",
    "Stretched out on a beach towel",
    "in his front yard, his body mystified me,",
    "while mine seemed happy to defy me.",
    "My dick would tent my cut-offs",
    "at the sight of him.",
    "I wore two pair of underwear,",
    "but even then I thought I\u2019d burst",
    "right through the seams.",
    "So I didn\u2019t dare tell mother what I\u2019d dreamed,",
    "though she did think to ask me.",
    "I\u2019d have been a fool to tell her that.",
    "She thought my blush was any boy\u2019s,",
    "puzzling out his sexuality, but I swear it was",
    "as much because the fantasies",
    "were always other boys.",
    "some from my baseball team,",
    "some the roughnecks at school,",
    "but usually Lance. He was flying",
    "naked in the dream I had that night,",
    "the one that made me think that God",
    "was mad and killing me. I was lying",
    "(also naked \u2014 and hard as cinder block)",
    "on the beach towel I\u2019d seen him lay",
    "across the grass the day before.",
    "I tried to understand the signs implying",
    "I might turn into some kind of freaky thing.",
    "But it would have been cruel to tell my mother that,",
    "especially when she was already crying,",
    "and trying not to laugh at the same time,",
    "when I showed her what came out of me.",
    "She apologized for throwing such a scene,",
    "said I was growing up to be a man, that\u2019s all it meant,",
    "said it was normal for a boy my age\u2019s thing",
    "to start uprising like a metal beam.",
    "She apologized again",
    "that I didn\u2019t have my dad around to train",
    "an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty.",
    "I was as stupefied as I\u2019ve ever been.",
    "She never mentioned him.",
    "And I have never turned a deeper red",
    "than I did then, at 26 past midnight,",
    "when my mother helped me change my sheets,",
    "and said the next day she\u2019d teach me to wash them.",
    "And then she said she\u2019d ask the man across the street",
    "to talk to me. Would that be okay?",
    "Or would I feel more comfortable",
    "with someone younger, like his son?"

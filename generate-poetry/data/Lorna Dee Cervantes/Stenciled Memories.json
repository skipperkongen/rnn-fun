    "There was always fabric in your lap",
    "and a whistle in your heart. A sweet",
    "sap to be sucked waited in the garden.",
    "Nymphs of newts nestled under rock,",
    "your role as",
    "intact. Between the trilling of the crickets",
    "educating into the night and the sad sack",
    "of cans in the mornings something grew,",
    "flourished in the dark \u2014 vines as sturdy",
    "as telephone wire writhed in the breezes.",
    "You patched together a blanket of us,",
    "sewed together the mismatched and lopped",
    "off edges. And anger grew a twin, ripped",
    "through the bermuda grass, something stubborn",
    "and determined: Me, in a leather patchwork skirt,",
    "the bitter lemon song returning to its beginning",
    "over and over on the Howdie Doody phonograph,",
    "a handful of bandages, a faceful of ghosts",
    "delivered from the mirrors. How did you stand it?",
    "All of it. Us crunching through your set life,",
    "kids scuffling through the mounds of leave.",
    "Always making do. Your sunshine eyes,",
    "those stenciled memories where",
    "we still live."

    "best thought, you had taught",
    "me \u2014 a river runs through it,",
    "the foot of the soul standing",
    "stubbornly in the freeze, all",
    "the shards of ice crumpling up",
    "the banks, what survives",
    "in the ignorance. Play it away.",
    "Be ceremony. Be a lit candle",
    "to what blows you. Outside,",
    "the sun gives a favorite present,",
    "mountain nests in ironic meadows,",
    "otter takes off her shoes, the small",
    "hands of her feet reaching, reaching; still,",
    "far away people are dying. Crisp",
    "one dollar bills fold another life.",
    "You taught me to care in the moment,",
    "carve day into light, or something,",
    "moving in the west that doesn't destroy",
    "us. Look again, in the coming summer,",
    "the cruelest month alive still eats up",
    "the hours. Regret is an uneven hand,",
    "a rough palm at the cheek \u2014 tender",
    "and calloused. I drink another glass",
    "of water, turn on the tap",
    "for what grows, for you,",
    "for what lasts, for the last",
    "and the first found thought of you."

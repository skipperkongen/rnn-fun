    "Darling, I leave you the forever unblooming",
    "twig half-sunk in spring mud & the Nature that allows",
    "such delicate & lasting atrocity.",
    "Darling, darling, darling: my voice is a branch that would reach.",
    "I leave you the ragged sky, once full of cloud & now",
    "not. I leave you these things just as I leave",
    "you: graceful passage from one something to the next.",
    "Darling, even in this my voice dissipates",
    "into hush & whiffs of light, sun-thrown, hurtle into the ground."

    "The buried temple empties through its bowels,",
    "Sepulchral sewer spewing mud and rubies,",
    "Abominably some idol of Anubis,",
    "Its muzzle all aflame with savage howls.",
    "Or if the recent gas the wick befouls",
    "That bears so many insults, it illumines",
    "In haggard outline an immortal pubis",
    "Flying along the streetlights on its prowls.",
    "What wreaths dried out in cities without prayer",
    "Of night could bless like that which settles down",
    "Vainly against the marble of Baudelaire",
    "In the fluttering veil that girds her absence round,",
    "A tutelary poison, his own Wraith,",
    "We breathe in always though it bring us death."

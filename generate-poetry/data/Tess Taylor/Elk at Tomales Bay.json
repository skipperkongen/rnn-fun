    "bowed into rustling foxtails.",
    "Males muscled over the slopes,",
    "jostling mantles, marking terrain.",
    "Their antlers clambered wide,",
    "steep as the gorges.",
    "As they fed, those branches twitched,",
    "sensory, delicate,",
    "yet when one buck reared",
    "squaring to look at us",
    "his antlers and his gaze",
    "held suddenly motionless.",
    "Further out, the skeleton.",
    "The tar paper it seemed to lie on",
    "was hide.",

    "an uneven heart-shaped cavern",
    "where a coccyx curled to its tip.",
    "Ribs fanned open",
    "hollow, emptied of organs.",
    "In the bushes its skull.",
    "Sockets and sinuses, mandible,",
    "its few small teeth.",
    "All bare now except",
    "that fur the red-brown color",
    "of a young boy\u2019s head and also",
    "of wild iris stalks in winter",
    "still clung to the drying scalp.",
    "Below the eye\u2019s rim sagged",
    "flat as a bicycle tire.",
    "The form was sinking away.",
    "The skin loosened, becoming other,",
    "shedding the mask that hides",
    "but must also reveal a creature.",
    "Off amid cliffs and hills",
    "some unfleshed force roamed free.",
    "In the wind, I felt",
    "the half-life I watched watch me.",
    "Elk, I said, I see",
    "you abandon this life, this earth\u2014",
    "I stood for a time with the bones."

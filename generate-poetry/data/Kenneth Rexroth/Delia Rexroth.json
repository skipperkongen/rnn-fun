    "Under your illkempt yellow roses,",
    "Delia, today you are younger",
    "Than your son. Two and a half decades \u2013",
    "The family monument sagged askew,",
    "And he overtook you for half-a-life.",
    "On the other side of the country,",
    "Near the willows by the slow river,",
    "Deep in the earth, the white ribs retain",
    "The curve of your fervent, careful breast;",
    "The fine skull, the ardor of your brain.",
    "And in the fingers the memory",
    "Of Chopin \u00e9tudes, and in the feet",
    "Slow waltzes and champagne twosteps sleep.",
    "And the white full moon of midsummer,",
    "That you watched awake all that last night,",
    "Watches history fill the deserts",
    "And oceans with corpses once again;",
    "And looks in the east window at me,",
    "As I move past you to middle age",
    "And knowledge past your agony and waste."

    "There is delight in singing, tho\u2019 none hear",
    "Beside the singer; and there is delight",
    "In praising, tho\u2019 the praiser sit alone",
    "And see the prais\u2019d far off him, far above.",
    "Shakspeare is not our poet, but the world\u2019s,",
    "Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee,",
    "Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale,",
    "No man hath walkt along our roads with step",
    "So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue",
    "So varied in discourse. But warmer climes",
    "Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the breeze",
    "Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on",
    "Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where",
    "The Siren waits thee, singing song for song."

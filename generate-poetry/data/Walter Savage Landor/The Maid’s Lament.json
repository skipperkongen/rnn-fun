    "I loved him not; and yet, now he is gone,",
    "I feel I am alone.",
    "I check\u2019d him while he spoke; yet, could he speak,",
    "Alas! I would not check.",
    "For reasons not to love him once I sought,",
    "And wearied all my thought",
    "To vex myself and him: I now would give",
    "My love could he but live",
    "Who lately lived for me, and, when he found",
    "\u2019Twas vain, in holy ground",
    "He hid his face amid the shades of death.",
    "I waste for him my breath",
    "Who wasted his for me! but mine returns,",
    "And this lorn bosom burns",
    "With stifling heat, heaving it up in sleep,",
    "And waking me to weep",
    "Tears that had melted his soft heart: for years",
    "Wept he as bitter tears.",
    "such was his latest prayer,",
    "Quieter is his breath, his breast more cold,",
    "Than daisies in the mould,",
    "Where children spell, athwart the churchyard gate,",
    "His name and life\u2019s brief date.",
    "Pray for him, gentle souls, whoe\u2019er you be,",
    "And oh! pray too for me!"

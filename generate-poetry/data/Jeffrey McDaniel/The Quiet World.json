    "In an effort to get people to look",
    "into each other\u2019s eyes more,",
    "and also to appease the mutes,",
    "the government has decided",
    "to allot each person exactly one hundred",
    "and sixty-seven words, per day.",
    "When the phone rings, I put it to my ear",
    "without saying hello. In the restaurant",
    "I point at chicken noodle soup.",
    "I am adjusting well to the new way.",
    "Late at night, I call my long distance lover,",
    "proudly say",
    "I saved the rest for you.",
    "When she doesn\u2019t respond,",
    "I know she\u2019s used up all her words,",
    "so I slowly whisper",
    "thirty-two and a third times.",
    "After that, we just sit on the line",
    "and listen to each other breathe."

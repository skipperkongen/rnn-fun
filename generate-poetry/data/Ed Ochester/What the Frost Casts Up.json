    "A crown of handmade nails, as though",
    "there were a house here once, burned,",
    "where we\u2019ve gardened for fifteen years;",
    "the ceramic top of an ancient fuse;",
    "this spring the tiny head of a plastic doll\u2014",
    "not much compared to what they find",
    "in England, where every now and then",
    "a coin of the Roman emperors, Severus",
    "or Constantius, works its way up, but",
    "something, as though nothing we\u2019ve",
    "ever touched wants to stay in the earth,",
    "the patient artifacts waiting, having been lost",
    "or cast away, as though they couldn\u2019t bear",
    "the parting, or because they are the only",
    "messengers from lives that were important once,",
    "waiting for the power of the frost",
    "to move them to the mercy of our hands."

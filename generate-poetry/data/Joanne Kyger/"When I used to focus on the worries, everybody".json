    "When I used to focus on the worries, everybody",

    "The waves came in closer and closer.",
    "When I fall into the gap of suspicion I am no longer here.",
    "In this world that has got closed over by houses",
    "and networks, I fly out",
    "from under the belly. Life\u2019s dizzy crown",
    "of whirling lights, circles this head. Pure",
    "with wonder, hot",
    "with wonder. The streets become golden. All",
    "size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth.",
    "We are in easy understanding.",
    "Scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us.",
    "It is memory. As I search to find",
    "this day\u2019s sweet drifting. The fog out to sea, the wind."

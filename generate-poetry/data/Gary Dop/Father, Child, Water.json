    "I lift your body to the boat",
    "before you drown or choke or slip too far",
    "beneath. I didn\u2019t think\u2014just jumped, just did",
    "what I did like the physics",
    "that flung you in. My hands clutch under",
    "year-old arms, between your life",
    "jacket and your bobbing frame, pushing you,",
    "like a fountain cherub, up and out.",
    "I\u2019m fooled by the warmth pulsing from",
    "the gash on my thigh, sliced wide and clean",
    "by an errant screw on the stern.",
    "No pain. My legs kick out blood below.",
    "My arms strain",
    "against our deaths to hold you up",
    "as I lift you, crying, reaching, to the boat."

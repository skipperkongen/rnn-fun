    "In our house we live with Arlene. My little sister has a plan.",
    "She has what they call a beginner\u2019s mind. She sees everything",
    "from an un-given-up perspective. I\u2019m frightened; I know",
    "Arlene better than anyone; she knows me better. Esme says",
    "if I\u2019m scared we can\u2019t win. But I am scared. Arlene drags me",
    "over to the window where the black mould has made",
    "a map of Australia. Australia gives me trouble breathing,",
    "it\u2019s so far away. Arlene points it out and I get the feeling",
    "in my chest, my whole life in there twisted up like a snake.",
    "It could bite me or her. She puts a hand on my breastbone.",
    ". I want to tell her we can look after ourselves.",
    "I want to tell her I\u2019m in charge now, but I can still see the dark",
    "blur at the edges. I don\u2019t sleep anymore, my head is full",
    "of this insomniac light. I lie awake watching over my sisters",
    "and I listen to them breathe. Esme whispers that I should",
    "wake her if I need to. I say I will, but I never do. Even when",
    "I sleep I dream I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m standing there looking",
    "down at them, the night pouring from my hands. Esme has",
    "a future in mind. She\u2019s always laughing. She gets up early",
    "and makes buttermilk pancakes using normal milk soured",
    "with lemon juice. She tries things out. Arlene tells us",
    "to stay away from sharp things or we\u2019ll cut ourselves. Esme",
    "does what she likes. She grates apple for a new recipe and",
    "cuts her knuckle and laughs. I don\u2019t know if I can live my life.",
    "I don\u2019t know if I can look after someone as unafraid as Esme.",
    "I don\u2019t know how to change what I do, the way someone",
    "eating soup will, out of habit, bite down. Esme laughs; she\u2019s",
    "serving up apple pancakes with banana and maple syrup",
    "and she says,",
    ". A row of mornings fan out.",
    "And the pancakes are sweet and slightly gummy with a salt edge."

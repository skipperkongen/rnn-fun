    "The flowers I planted along my road",
    "Have lasted long despite winds and cold",
    "Already fiery noons begin to burn",
    "Slyly the secret of the roots",
    "And I know that of my footsteps nothing will remain",
    "But a trace a cluster a drop",
    "To recall along the paths I\u2019ve chosen",
    "Those evening when the light sang",
    "In eyes hands hearts and goblets.",
    "I love the sweet harshness on the tongue",
    "Filling the palate with a promised saliva",
    "Knocking the mute keyboard of the teeth",
    "With raised draperies of which one might say",
    "That memory retains a fleeting trail of them",
    "Half-glimpsed we won\u2019t know how or else",
    "The loud reminder of the single moment",
    "All gravity banished the unconscious pleasure recaptured",
    "Of being nothing but entirely animal.",
    "For our life closed on that iridescent sphere",
    "\u2014Color taste perfume at their extreme limits\u2014invokes",
    "Some miracle independent of its origin",
    "Produced by distilling air and earth\u2014",
    "Like the move toward technological planets",
    "After a calculation made on the fingers of one hand\u2014",
    "Time contained flowing\u2014continual autumn",
    "This evening this wine that enters me to make",
    "My head light my tongue loose my cock happy."

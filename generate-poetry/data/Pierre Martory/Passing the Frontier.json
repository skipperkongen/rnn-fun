    "The yellow line could be seen for as long a time",
    "As the highway desired",
    "And if you fell asleep at the wheel",
    "It fulgurated in the dozing soul",
    "Like a brutal revelation",
    "That allows you not to feel",
    "In the dream\u2019s snapshot",
    "Your brain getting smashed",
    "Against the milestone or the windshield",
    "It was an ideal line",
    "Crowned with horizontal blue",
    "That unwound day after day",
    "Like a clothesline",
    "Flags and scalps and washed-out roses",
    "Our countries our combats our wars",
    "Mingling lassitude with involuntary starts",
    "A gymnastic in disorder",
    "That sickened our hearts"

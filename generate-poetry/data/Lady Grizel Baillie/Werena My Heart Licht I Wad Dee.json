    "There was ance a may, and she lo\u2019ed na men;",
    "She biggit her bonnie bow\u2019r doun i\u2019 yon glen;",
    "But now she cries, Dool and a well-a-day!",
    "Come doun the green gait and come here away!",
    "When bonnie young Johnnie cam\u2019 owre the sea",
    "He said he saw naething sae lovely as me;",
    "He hecht me baith rings and monie braw things;",
    "And werena my heart licht, I wad dee.",
    "He had a wee tittie that lo\u2019ed na me,",
    "Because I was twice as bonnie as she;",
    "She raised sic a pother \u2018twixt him and his mother,",
    "That werena my heart licht, I wad dee.",
    "The day it was set, and the bridal to be",
    "The wife took a dwam and lay doun to dee;",
    "She maned, and she graned, out o\u2019 dolour and pain,",
    "Till he vowed that he ne\u2019er wad see me again.",
    "His kin was for ane o\u2019 a higher degree,",
    "Said, what had he do wi\u2019 the likes o\u2019 me?",
    "Albeit I was bonnie, I wasna for Johnnie:",
    "And werena my heart licht, I wad dee.",
    "They said I had neither cow nor calf,",
    "Nor dribbles o\u2019 drink rins through the draff,",
    "Nor pickles o\u2019meal rins through the mill-e\u2019e;",
    "An werena my heart licht, I wad dee.",
    "His tittie she was baith wily and slee,",
    "She spied me as I cam\u2019 owre the lea,",
    "And then she ran in and made a loud din;",
    "Believe your ain een an ye trow na me.",
    "His bannet stood aye fu\u2019 round on his brow",
    "His auld ane looked aye as weel as some\u2019s new;",
    "But now he lets \u2019t wear ony gate it will hing,",
    "And casts himsel\u2019 dowie upon the corn-bing.",
    "And now he gaes daund\u2019ring about the dykes",
    "A a\u2019 he dow do is to hund the tykes;",
    "The love-lang nicht he ne\u2019er steeks his e\u2019e;",
    "And werena my heart licht I wad dee.",
    "Were I but young for thee, as I ha\u2019e been",
    "We should ha\u2019e been gallopin\u2019 doun in yon green,",
    "And linkin\u2019 it on the lily-white lea;",
    "And wow, gin I were but young for thee."

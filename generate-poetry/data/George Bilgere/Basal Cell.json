    "The sun is still burning in my skin",
    "even though it set half-an-hour ago,",
    "and Cindy and Bob and Bev and John",
    "are pulling on their sweatshirts",
    "and gathering around the fire pit.",
    "John hands me a cold one",
    "and now Bev comes into my arms",
    "and I can feel the sun\u2019s heat,",
    "and taste the Pacific on her cheek.",
    "I am not in Vietnam,",
    "nor is John or Bob, because",
    "our deferments came through,",
    "and we get to remain boys",
    "for at least another summer",
    "like this one in Santa Cruz,",
    "surfing the afternoons in a sweet",
    "blue dream I\u2019m remembering now,",
    "as the nurse puts my cheek to sleep,",
    "and the doctor begins to burn",
    "those summers away."

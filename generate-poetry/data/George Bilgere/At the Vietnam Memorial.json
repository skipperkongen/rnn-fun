    "The last time I saw Paul Castle",
    "it was printed in gold on the wall",
    "above the showers in the boys\u2019",
    "locker room, next to the school",
    "record for the mile. I don\u2019t recall",
    "his time, but the year was 1968",
    "and I can look across the infield",
    "of memory to see him on the track,",
    "legs flashing, body bending slightly",
    "beyond the pack of runners at his back.",
    "He couldn\u2019t spare a word for me,",
    "two years younger, junior varsity,",
    "and hardly worth the waste of breath.",
    "He owned the hallways, a cool blonde",
    "at his side, and aimed his interests",
    "further down the line than we could guess.",
    "Now, reading the name again,",
    "I see us standing in the showers,",
    "naked kids beneath his larger,",
    "comprehensive force\u2014the ones who trail",
    "obscurely, in the wake of the swift,",
    "like my shadow on this gleaming wall."

    "Once you said joking slyly,",
    "I\u2019ll come to haunt your solemn bed,",
    "I\u2019ll stand and glower at the head",
    "And see if my place is empty still, or filled.",
    "What was it woke me in the early darkness",
    "Before the first bird\u2019s twittering?",
    "\u2014A shape dissolving and flittering",
    "Unsteady as a flame in a drafty house.",
    "It seemed a concentration of the dark burning",
    "By the bedpost at my right hand",
    "While to my left that no man\u2019s land",
    "Of sheet stretched palely as a false morning....",
    "All day I have been sick and restless. This evening",
    "Curtained, with all the lights on,",
    "I start up\u2014only to sit down.",
    "Why should I grieve after ten years of grieving?",
    "What if last night I was the one who lay dead",
    "While the dead burned beside me",
    "Trembling with passionate pity",
    "At my blameless life and shaking its flamelike head?"

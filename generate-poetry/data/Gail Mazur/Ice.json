    "In the warming house, children lace their skates,",
    "bending, choked, over their thick jackets.",
    "A Franklin stove keeps the place so cozy",
    "it\u2019s hard to imagine why anyone would leave,",
    "clumping across the frozen beach to the river.",
    "December\u2019s always the same at Ware\u2019s Cove,",
    "the first sheer ice, black, then white",
    "and deep until the city sends trucks of men",
    "with wooden barriers to put up the boys\u2019",
    "hockey rink. An hour of skating after school,",
    "of trying wobbly figure-8\u2019s, an hour",
    "of distances moved backwards without falling,",
    "then\u2014twilight, the warming house steamy",
    "with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs",
    "aching. Outside, the hockey players keep",
    "playing, slamming the round black puck",
    "until it\u2019s dark, until supper. At night,",
    "a shy girl comes to the cove with her father.",
    "Although there isn\u2019t music, they glide",
    "arm in arm onto the blurred surface together,",
    "braced like dancers. She thinks she\u2019ll never",
    "be so happy, for who else will find her graceful,",
    "find her perfect, skate with her",
    "in circles outside the emptied rink forever?"

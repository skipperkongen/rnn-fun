    "I want to find my way back to her,",
    "to help her, to grab her hand, pull her",
    "up from the wooden floor of the stacks",
    "where she\u2019s reading accounts of the hatchet",
    "murders of Lizzie Borden\u2019s harsh parents",
    "as if she could learn something about",
    "life if she knew all the cuts and slashes;",
    "her essay on Wordsworth or Keats",
    "only a knot in her belly, a faint pressure",
    "at her temples. She\u2019s pale, it\u2019s five years",
    "before the first migraine, but the dreamy",
    "flush has already drained from her face.",
    "I want to lead her out of the library,",
    "to sit with her on a bench under a still",
    "living elm tree,",
    ",",
    "but even today I don\u2019t understand,",
    "I want to shake her and want to assure her,",
    "to hold her\u2014but love\u2019s not safe for her,",
    "although she craves what she knows",
    "of it, love\u2019s a snare, a closed door,",
    "a dank cell. Maybe she should just leave",
    "the campus, take a train to Fall River,",
    "inspect Lizzie\u2019s room, the rigid corsets",
    "and buttoned shoes, the horsehair sofas,",
    "the kitchen\u2019s rank stew. Hell. Bleak",
    "loyal judgmental journals of a next-door",
    "neighbor\u2014not a friend, Lizzie had no friend.",
    "If only she could follow one trajectory",
    "of thought, a plan, invent a journey",
    "out of this place, a vocation\u2014",
    "but without me to guide her, where",
    "would she go? And what did I ever offer,",
    "what stiffening of spine? What goal?",
    "Rather, stiffening of soul, her soul",
    "cocooned in the library\u2019s trivia.",
    "Soul circling its lessons. What can I say",
    "before she walks like a ghost in white lace",
    "carrying her bouquet of stephanotis,",
    "her father beaming innocently at her side,",
    "a boy waiting, trembling, to shape her?",
    "He\u2019s innocent, too, we are all innocent,",
    "even Lizzie Borden who surely did take",
    "the axe. It was so hot that summer morning.",
    "The hard-hearted stepmother, heavy hand",
    "of the father. There was another daughter",
    "they favored, and Lizzie, stewing at home,",
    "heavy smell of mutton in the pores",
    "of history. But this girl, her story\u2019s",
    "still a mystery\u2014I tell myself she\u2019s a quick",
    "study, a survivor. There\u2019s still time.",
    "Soon she\u2019ll close the bloody book,",
    "slink past the lit carrels, through",
    "the library\u2019s heavy door to the world.",
    "kneel beside her on the dusty floor",
    "where we\u2019re avoiding her assignment?"

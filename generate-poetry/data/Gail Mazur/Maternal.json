    "On the telephone, friends mistake us now",
    "when we first say hello\u2014not after.",
    "And that oddly optimistic lilt",
    "we share nourishes my hopes:",
    "we do",
    "happy. . . .",
    "Last night, in my dream\u2019s crib,",
    "a one-day infant girl.",
    "I wasn\u2019t totally unprepared\u2014",
    "there was the crib, and cotton kimonos,",
    "not just a padded dresser drawer.",
    "And then, I knew I could drive",
    "to the store for the tiny, funny",
    "clothes my daughter wears.",
    "I was in a familiar room",
    "and leaned over the rail, crooning",
    "and the smiling baby\u2014",
    "she\u2019d be too young for speech,",
    "I know, or smiles\u2014",
    "gurgled back at me,",
    "\u2014If I could begin again,",
    "I\u2019d hold her longer, closer!",
    "Maybe that way, when night opens",
    "into morning, and all my windows",
    "gape at the heartbreaking street,",
    "my dreams wouldn\u2019t pierce so,",
    "I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath",
    "at the parts of my life still in hiding,",
    "my childhood\u2019s white house",
    "where I lunged toward the flowers of love",
    "as if I were courting death. . . .",
    "Over the crib, a mobile was spinning,",
    "bright birds going nowhere,",
    "primary colors, primary",
    "as mothering once seemed. . . .",
    "Later, I wonder why I dreamt",
    "that dream, yearning for what I\u2019ve had,",
    "and have",
    "why it was my mother\u2019s room,",
    "the blonde moderne bedroom set",
    "hidden under years of junk\u2014a spare room\u2019s",
    "the nicest way to put it,",
    "though now all",
    "her crowded rooms are spare\u2014"

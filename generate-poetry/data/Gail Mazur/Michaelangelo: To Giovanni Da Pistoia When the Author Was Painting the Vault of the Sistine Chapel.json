    "I've already grown a goiter from this torture,",
    "hunched up here like a cat in Lombardy",
    "(or anywhere else where the stagnant water's poison).",
    "My stomach's squashed under my chin, my beard's",
    "pointing at heaven, my brain's crushed in a casket,",
    "my breast twists like a harpy's. My brush,",
    "above me all the time, dribbles paint",
    "so my face makes a fine floor for droppings!",
    "My haunches are grinding into my guts,",
    "my poor ass strains to work as a counterweight,",
    "every gesture I make is blind and aimless.",
    "My skin hangs loose below me, my spine's",
    "all knotted from folding over itself.",
    "I'm bent taut as a Syrian bow.",
    "Because I'm stuck like this, my thoughts",
    "are crazy, perfidious tripe:",
    "anyone shoots badly through a crooked blowpipe.",
    "My painting is dead.",
    "Defend it for me, Giovanni, protect my honor.",
    "I am not in the right place\u2014I am not a painter."

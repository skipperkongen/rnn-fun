    "The love we\u2019ve defined for ourselves",
    "in privacy, in suffering,",
    "keeps both of us lonely as a fist,",
    "but does intimacy mean a happy ending?",
    "I\u2019m afraid of marriage.",
    "Driving past them at night, the shadows",
    "on a drawn curtain hide terrible lives:",
    "a father stuck in a job, his daughter",
    "opening her blouse to strangers.",
    "And your hands, for example,",
    "like a warm liquid on my face",
    "don\u2019t evaporate as you take them away.",
    "Nor are our betrayals silent,",
    "although we listen only in passing.",
    "We\u2019re learning how to walk unlit streets,",
    "to see threats instead of trees,",
    "the right answer to a teenager",
    "opening his knife. The answer is yes.",
    "Always we couldn\u2019t do otherwise."

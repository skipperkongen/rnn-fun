    "Wanting leads to worse than oddity.",
    "The bones creak like bamboo in wind,",
    "and strain toward a better life outside the body,",
    "the life anything has that isn\u2019t human.",
    "Feel the chair under you? What does it want?",
    "Does lust bend it silly, like a rubber crutch?",
    "Tell a tree about the silky clasp of cunt.",
    "It won\u2019t shift an inch. It won\u2019t ache to touch.",
    "Let me not cruise for teens in a red sports car,",
    "or glare too long at what bubbles their clothes.",
    "Let me never hustle file clerks in a bar.",
    "Keep me from the beach when the hot wind blows.",
    "If I must go mad, let it be dignified.",
    "Lock me up where I\u2019ll feel like wood,",
    "where wanting won\u2019t send me flopping outside,",
    "where my bones will shut up, where I\u2019ll be good."

    "Reading in the paper a summary",
    "of a five-year psychological study",
    "that shows those perceived as most beautiful",
    "are treated differently,",
    "I think",
    "remembering a kind of pudgy kid",
    "and late puberty, the bloody noses",
    "and wisecracks because I wore glasses,",
    "though we all know by now how awful it is",
    "for the busty starlet no one takes seriously,",
    "the loveliest women I\u2019ve lunched with",
    "lamenting the opacity of the body,",
    "they can never trust a man\u2019s interest",
    "even when he seems not just out for sex",
    "(eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass),",
    "and who",
    "want to live like this?",
    "And what does beauty do to a man?\u2014",
    "Don Juan, Casanova, Lord Byron\u2014",
    "those fiery eyes and steel jawlines",
    "can front a furnace of self-loathing,",
    "all those breathless women rushing to him",
    "while hubby\u2019s at the office or ball game,",
    "primed to be consumed by his beauty",
    "while he stands next to it, watching.",
    "So maybe the looks we\u2019re dealt are best.",
    "It\u2019s only common sense that happiness",
    "depends on some bearable deprivation",
    "or defect, and who knows what conflicts",
    "great beauty could have caused,",
    "what cruelties one might have suffered",
    "from those now friends, what unmanageable",
    "possibilities smiling at every small turn?",
    "So if I get up to draw a tumbler",
    "of ordinary tap water and think",
    "nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers,",
    "will all I\u2019ve missed knock me senseless?",
    "No. Of course not. It won\u2019t."

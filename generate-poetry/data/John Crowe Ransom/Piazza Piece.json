    "\u2014I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying",
    "To make you hear. Your ears are soft and small",
    "And listen to an old man not at all,",
    "They want the young men\u2019s whispering and sighing.",
    "But see the roses on your trellis dying",
    "And hear the spectral singing of the moon;",
    "For I must have my lovely lady soon,",
    "I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying.",
    "\u2014I am a lady young in beauty waiting",
    "Until my truelove comes, and then we kiss.",
    "But what grey man among the vines is this",
    "Whose words are dry and faint as in a dream?",
    "Back from my trellis, Sir, before I scream!",
    "I am a lady young in beauty waiting."

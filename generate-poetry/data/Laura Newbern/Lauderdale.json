    "At dusk, the grandmother sits alone",
    "in the light of the long pale pool and speaks",
    "to the frog who is waiting",
    "by the electric gate of the clubhouse.",
    ", she says, leaning out",
    "from her chair. Her voice",
    "is churning, and old, and wet",
    "with advice. Her newly red hair",
    "purples under the bug light.",
    ", she says, again, and again",
    "the sky rolls in and out on its journey",
    "across the peninsula, rattling the palms."

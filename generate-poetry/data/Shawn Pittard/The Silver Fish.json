    "I killed a great silver fish,",
    "cut him open with a long",
    "thin knife. The river carried",
    "his heart away. I took his",
    "dead eyes home. His red flesh",
    "sang to me on the fire I built",
    "in my backyard. His taste",
    "was the lost memory of my",
    "wildness. Behind amber clouds",
    "of cedar smoke, Orion",
    "drew his bow. A black moon rose",
    "from the night\u2019s dark waters,",
    "a sliver of its bright face",
    "reflecting back into the universe."

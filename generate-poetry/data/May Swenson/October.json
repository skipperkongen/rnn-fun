    "A smudge for the horizon",
    "that, on a clear day, shows",
    "the hard edge of hills and",
    "buildings on the other coast.",
    "Anchored boats all head one way:",
    "north, where the wind comes from.",
    "You can see the storm inflating",
    "out of the west. A dark hole",
    "in gray cloud twirls, widens,",
    "while white rips multiply",
    "on the water far out.",
    "Wet tousled yellow leaves,",
    "thick on the slate terrace.",
    "The jay\u2019s hoarse cry. He\u2019s",
    "stumbling in the air,",
    "too soaked to fly.",
    "Knuckles of the rain",
    "on the roof,",
    "chuckles into the drain-",
    "pipe, spatters on",
    "the leaves that litter",
    "the grass. Melancholy",
    "morning, the tide full",
    "in the bay, an overflowing",
    "bowl. At least, no wind,",
    "no roughness in the sky,",
    "its gray face bedraggled",
    "by its tears.",
    "Peeling a pear, I remember",
    "my daddy\u2019s hand. His thumb",
    "(the one that got nipped by the saw,",
    "lacked a nail) fit into",
    "the cored hollow of the slippery",
    "half his knife skinned so neatly.",
    "Dad would pare the fruit from our",
    "orchard in the fall, while Mother",
    "boiled the jars, prepared for",
    "\u201cputting up.\u201d Dad used to darn",
    "our socks when we were small,",
    "and cut our hair and toenails.",
    "Sunday mornings, in pajamas, we\u2019d",
    "take turns in his lap. He\u2019d help",
    "bathe us sometimes. Dad could do",
    "anything. He built our dining table,",
    "chairs, the buffet, the bay window",
    "seat, my little desk of cherry wood",
    "where I wrote my first poems. That",
    "day at the shop, splitting panel",
    "boards on the electric saw (oh, I",
    "can hear the screech of it now,",
    "the whirling blade that sliced",
    "my daddy\u2019s thumb), he received the mar",
    "that, long after, in his coffin,",

    "I do not mean to pray.",
    "The posture for thanks or",
    "supplication is the same",
    "as for weariness or relief.",
    "But I am glad for the luck",
    "of light. Surely it is godly,",
    "that it makes all things",

    "actual to each other.",
    "Light that\u2019s sucked into",
    "the eye, warming the brain",
    "with wires of color.",
    "Light that hatched life",
    "out of the cold egg of earth.",
    "Dark wild honey, the lion\u2019s",
    "eye color, you brought home",
    "from a country store.",
    "Tastes of the work of shaggy",
    "bees on strong weeds,",
    "their midsummer bloom.",
    "My brain\u2019s electric circuit",
    "glows, like the lion\u2019s iris",

    "a newel poked out of the tent",
    "top\u2019s slippery sheet, while my",
    "hairs\u2019 straight rays rained",
    "down, making pattern on the neat",
    "vacant cosmos of my lap. And",
    "maybe it was those tiny flies,",
    "phantoms of my aging eyes, seen",
    "out of the sides floating (that,",
    "when you turn to find them",
    "full face, always dissolve) but",

    "marked in clearest ink, Hairs",

    "ends streaking little comets,",
    "till they tumbled to confuse",
    "with all the others in their",
    "fizzled heaps, in canyons of my",
    "lap. And what keeps asking",
    "in my head now that, brushed off",
    "and finished, I\u2019m walking",
    "in the street, is how can those",
    "numbers remain all the way through,",
    "and all along the length of every",
    "hair, and even before each one",
    "is grown, apparently, through",
    "my scalp? For, if the hairs of my",
    "head are numbered, it means",

    "the woods, now that limbs are bare,",

    "along the scarcely gliding stream,",

    "swamp and woods the sun still",

    "strenuous migration. Better here,",
    "in the familiar, to fade."

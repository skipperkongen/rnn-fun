    "She sat on a shelf,",
    "her breasts two bellies",
    "on her poked-out belly,",
    "on which the navel looked",
    "like a sucked-in mouth\u2014",
    "her knees bent and apart,",
    "her long left arm raised,",
    "with the large hand knuckled",
    "to a bar in the ceiling\u2014",
    "her right hand clamping",
    "the skinny infant to her chest\u2014",
    "its round, pale, new,",
    "soft muzzle hunting",
    "in the brown hair for a nipple,",
    "its splayed, tiny hand picking",
    "at her naked, dirty ear.",
    "Twisting its little neck,",
    "with tortured, ecstatic eyes",
    "the size of lentils, it looked",
    "into her severe, close-set,",
    "solemn eyes, that beneath bald",
    "eyelids glared\u2014dull lights",
    "in sockets of leather.",
    "She twitched some chin-hairs,",
    "with pain or pleasure,",
    "as the baby-mouth found and",
    "yanked at her nipple;",
    "its pink-nailed, jointless",
    "fingers, wandering her face,",
    "tangled in the tufts",
    "of her cliffy brows.",
    "She brought her big",
    "hand down from the bar",
    "with pretended exasperation",
    "unfastened the little hand,",
    "and locked it within her palm\u2014",
    "while her right hand",
    "with snag-nailed forefinger",
    "and short, sharp thumb, raked",
    "the new orange hair",
    "of the infant\u2019s skinny flank\u2014",
    "and found a louse,",
    "which she lipped, and",
    "thoughtfully crisped",
    "between broad teeth.",
    "She wrinkled appreciative",
    "nostrils which, without a nose,",
    "stood open\u2014damp holes",
    "above the poke of her mouth.",
    "She licked her lips, flicked",
    "her leather eyelids\u2014",
    "then, suddenly flung",
    "up both arms and grabbed",
    "the bars overhead.",
    "The baby\u2018s scrabbly fingers",
    "instantly caught the hair\u2014",
    "as if there were metal rings there\u2014",
    "in her long, stretched armpits.",
    "And, as she stately swung,",
    "and then proudly, more swiftly",
    "slung herself from corner",
    "to corner of her cell\u2014",
    "arms longer than her round",
    "body, short knees bent\u2014",
    "her little wild-haired,",
    "poke-mouthed infant hung,",
    "like some sort of trophy,",
    "or decoration, or shaggy medal\u2014",
    "shaped like herself\u2014but new,",
    "clean, soft and shining",
    "on her chest."

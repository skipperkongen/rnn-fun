    "\u201cFeel me to do right,\u201d our father said on his deathbed.",
    "We did not quite know\u2014in fact, not at all\u2014what he meant.",
    "His last whisper was spent as through a slot in a wall.",
    "He left us a key, but how did it fit? \u201cFeel me",
    "to do right.\u201d Did it mean that, though he died, he would be felt",
    "through some aperture, or by some unseen instrument",
    "our dad just then had come to know? So, to do right always,",
    "we need but feel his spirit? Or was it merely his apology",
    "for dying? \u201cFeel that I do right in not trying,",
    "as you insist, to stay on your side. There is the wide",
    "gateway and the splendid tower, and you implore me",
    "to wait here, with the worms!\u201d",
    "Had he defined his terms, and could we discriminate",
    "among his motives, we might have found out how to \u201cdo right\u201d",
    "before",
    "died\u2014supposing he felt he suddenly knew",
    "what dying was. \u201cYou do wrong because you do not feel",
    "as I do now\u201d was maybe the sense. \u201cFeel me, and emulate",
    "my state, for I am becoming less dense\u2014I am feeling right",
    "for the first time.\u201d And then the vessel burst,",
    "and we were kneeling around an emptiness.",
    "We cannot feel our father now. His power courses through us,",
    "yes, but",
    "\u2014the chest and cheek, the foot and palm,",
    "the mouth of oracle\u2014is calm. And we still seek",
    "his meaning. \u201cFeel me,\u201d he said, and emphasized that word.",
    "Should we have heard it as a plea for a caress\u2014",
    "a constant caress, since flesh to flesh was all that we",
    "could do right if we would bless him?",
    "The dying must feel the pressure of that question\u2014",
    "lying flat, turning cold from brow to heel\u2014the hot",
    "cowards there above protesting their love, and saying,",
    "\u201cWhat can we do? Are you all right?\u201d While the wall opens",
    "and the blue night pours through. \u201cWhat can we do?",
    "We want to do what\u2019s right.\u201d",
    "\u201cLie down with me, and hold me, tight. Touch me. Be",
    "with me. Feel with me.",
    "me to do right.\u201d"

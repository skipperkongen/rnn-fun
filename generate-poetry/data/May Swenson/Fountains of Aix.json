    "Beards of water",

    "Others are blowing whistles of water.",
    "Faces astonished that constant water",
    "jumps from their mouths.",

    "through green teeth over chins of moss.",
    "Dolphins toss jets of water",
    "from open snouts",
    "to an upper theater of water.",
    "Children are riding swans and water",
    "coils from the S-shaped necks and spills",
    "in flat foils from pincered bills.",
    "A solemn curly-headed bull",
    "puts out a swollen tongue of water.",
    "Cupids naked are making water",
    "into a font that never is full.",
    "A goddess is driving a chariot through water.",
    "Her reins and whips are tight white water.",
    "Bronze hoofs of horses wrangle with water.",
    "Marble faces half hidden in leaves.",
    "Faces whose hair is leaves and grapes",
    "of stone are peering from living leaves.",
    "Faces with mossy lips unlocked",
    "always uttering water,",
    "water",
    "wearing their features blank",
    "their ears deaf, their eyes mad",
    "or patient or blind or astonished at water",
    "always uttered out of their mouths."

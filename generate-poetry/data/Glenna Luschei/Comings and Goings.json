    "In Tucson",
    "when a university student",

    "she might leave her desk",
    "and a chair, a bookcase outside her cave",

    "an old Victrola into your pickup",
    "and ratchet up a new song.",
    "You start that life in the West,",

    "winds down, it\u2019s okay to put out,",
    "\u201cTake me.\u201d",
    "What do we have in life",
    "but comings and goings?"

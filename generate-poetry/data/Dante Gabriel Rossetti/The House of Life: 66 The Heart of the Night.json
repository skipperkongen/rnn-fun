    "From child to youth; from youth to arduous man;",
    "From lethargy to fever of the heart;",
    "From faithful life to dream-dower'd days apart;",
    "From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;\u0097",
    "Thus much of change in one swift cycle ran",
    "Till now. Alas, the soul!\u0097how soon must she",
    "Accept her primal immortality,\u0097",
    "The flesh resume its dust whence it began?",
    "O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life!",
    "O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late,",
    "Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:",
    "That when the peace is garner'd in from strife,",
    "The work retriev'd, the will regenerate,",
    "This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death!"

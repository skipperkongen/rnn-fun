    "The wind flapp'd loose, the wind was still,",
    "Shaken out dead from tree and hill:",
    "I had walk'd on at the wind's will,\u2014",
    "I sat now, for the wind was still.",
    "Between my knees my forehead was,\u2014",
    "My lips, drawn in, said not Alas!",
    "My hair was over in the grass,",
    "My naked ears heard the day pass.",
    "My eyes, wide open, had the run",
    "Of some ten weeds to fix upon;",
    "Among those few, out of the sun,",
    "The woodspurge flower'd, three cups in one.",
    "From perfect grief there need not be",
    "Wisdom or even memory:",
    "One thing then learnt remains to me,\u2014",
    "The woodspurge has a cup of three."

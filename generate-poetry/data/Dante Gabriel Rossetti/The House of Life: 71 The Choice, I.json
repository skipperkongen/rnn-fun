    "Eat thou and drink; to-morrow thou shalt die.",
    "Surely the earth, that's wise being very old,",
    "Needs not our help. Then loose me, love, and hold",
    "Thy sultry hair up from my face; that I",
    "May pour for thee this golden wine, brim-high,",
    "Till round the glass thy fingers glow like gold.",
    "We'll drown all hours: thy song, while hours are toll'd,",
    "Shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky.",
    "Now kiss, and think that there are really those,",
    "My own high-bosom'd beauty, who increase",
    "Vain gold, vain lore, and yet might choose our way!",
    "Through many years they toil; then on a day",
    "They die not,\u0097for their life was death,\u0097but cease;",
    "And round their narrow lips the mould falls close."

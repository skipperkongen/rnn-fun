    "Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf",
    "How the heart feels a languid grief",
    "Laid on it for a covering,",
    "And how sleep seems a goodly thing",
    "In Autumn at the fall of the leaf?",
    "And how the swift beat of the brain",
    "Falters because it is in vain,",
    "In Autumn at the fall of the leaf",
    "Knowest thou not? and how the chief",
    "Of joys seems\u0097not to suffer pain?",
    "Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf",
    "How the soul feels like a dried sheaf",
    "Bound up at length for harvesting,",
    "And how death seems a comely thing",
    "In Autumn at the fall of the leaf?"

    "Like labour-laden moonclouds faint to flee",
    "From winds that sweep the winter-bitten wold,\u0097",
    "Like multiform circumfluence manifold",
    "Of night's flood-tide,\u0097like terrors that agree",
    "Of hoarse-tongued fire and inarticulate sea,\u0097",
    "Even such, within some glass dimm'd by our breath,",
    "Our hearts discern wild images of Death,",
    "Shadows and shoals that edge eternity.",
    "Howbeit athwart Death's imminent shade doth soar",
    "One Power, than flow of stream or flight of dove",
    "Sweeter to glide around, to brood above.",
    "Tell me, my heart,\u0097what angel-greeted door",
    "Or threshold of wing-winnow'd threshing-floor",
    "Hath guest fire-fledg'd as thine, whose lord is Love?"

    "This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect",
    "God's Virgin. Gone is a great while, and she",
    "Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee.",
    "Unto God's will she brought devout respect,",
    "Profound simplicity of intellect,",
    "And supreme patience. From her mother's knee",
    "Faithful and hopeful; wise in charity;",
    "Strong in grave peace; in pity circumspect.",
    "So held she through her girlhood; as it were",
    "An angel-water'd lily, that near God",
    "Grows and is quiet. Till, one dawn at home,",
    "She woke in her white bed, and had no fear",
    "At all,\u0097yet wept till sunshine, and felt aw'd:",
    "Because the fulness of the time was come."

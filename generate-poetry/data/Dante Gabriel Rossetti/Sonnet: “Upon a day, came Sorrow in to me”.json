    "Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me,",

    "And I perceived that she had ushered Bile",
    "And Pain into my house for company.",
    "Wherefore I said, \u2018Go forth \u2013 away with thee!\u2019",
    "But like a Greek she answered, full of guile,",
    "And went on arguing in an easy style.",
    "Then, looking, I saw Love come silently,",
    "Habited in black raiment, smooth and new,",
    "Having a black hat set upon his hair;",
    "And certainly the tears he shed were true.",
    "So that I asked, \u2018What ails thee, trifler?\u2019",
    "Answering, he said: \u2018A grief to be gone through;",
    "For our own lady\u2019s dying, brother dear.\u2019"

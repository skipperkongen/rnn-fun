    "Downhill I came, hungry, and yet not starved;",
    "Cold, yet had heat within me that was proof",
    "Against the North wind; tired, yet so that rest",
    "Had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof.",
    "Then at the inn I had food, fire, and rest,",
    "Knowing how hungry, cold, and tired was I.",
    "All of the night was quite barred out except",
    "An owl\u2019s cry, a most melancholy cry",
    "Shaken out long and clear upon the hill,",
    "No merry note, nor cause of merriment,",
    "But one telling me plain what I escaped",
    "And others could not, that night, as in I went.",
    "And salted was my food, and my repose,",
    "Salted and sobered, too, by the bird\u2019s voice",
    "Speaking for all who lay under the stars,",
    "Soldiers and poor, unable to rejoice."

    "Mother, the root of this little yellow flower",
    "Among the stones has the taste of quinine.",
    "Things are strange to-day on the cliff. The sun shines so bright,",
    "And the grasshopper works at his sewing-machine",
    "So hard. Here\u2019s one on my hand, mother, look;",
    "I lie so still. There\u2019s one on your book.",
    "But I have something to tell more strange. So leave",
    "Your book to the grasshopper, mother dear,\u2014",
    "Like a green knight in a dazzling market-place,\u2014",
    "And listen now. Can you hear what I hear",
    "Far out? Now and then the foam there curls",
    "And stretches a white arm out like a girl\u2019s.",
    "Fishes and gulls ring no bells. There cannot be",
    "A chapel or church between here and Devon,",
    "With fishes or gulls ringing its bell,\u2014hark!\u2014",
    "Somewhere under the sea or up in heaven.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s the bell, my son, out in the bay",
    "On the buoy. It does sound sweet to-day.\u201d",
    "Sweeter I never heard, mother, no, not in all Wales.",
    "I should like to be lying under that foam,",
    "Dead, but able to hear the sound of the bell,",
    "And certain that you would often come",
    "And rest, listening happily.",
    "I should be happy if that could be."

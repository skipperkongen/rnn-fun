    "The dim sea glints chill. The white sun is shy,",
    "And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry,",
    "Rough, long grasses keep white with frost",
    "At the hilltop by the finger-post;",
    "The smoke of the traveller\u2019s-joy is puffed",
    "Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft.",
    "I read the sign. Which way shall I go?",
    "A voice says: You would not have doubted so",
    "At twenty. Another voice gentle with scorn",
    "Says: At twenty you wished you had never been born.",
    "One hazel lost a leaf of gold",
    "From a tuft at the tip, when the first voice told",
    "The other he wished to know what \u2019twould be",
    "To be sixty by this same post. \u201cYou shall see,\u201d",
    "He laughed\u2014and I had to join his laughter\u2014",
    "\u201cYou shall see; but either before or after,",
    "Whatever happens, it must befall,",
    "A mouthful of earth to remedy all",
    "Regrets and wishes shall freely be given;",
    "And if there be a flaw in that heaven",
    "\u2019Twill be freedom to wish, and your wish may be",
    "To be here or anywhere talking to me,",
    "No matter what the weather, on earth,",
    "At any age between death and birth,",
    "To see what day or night can be,",
    "The sun and the frost, the land and the sea,",
    "Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,\u2014",
    "With a poor man of any sort, down to a king,",
    "Standing upright out in the air",
    "Wondering where he shall journey, O where?\u201d"

    "As the team\u2019s head-brass flashed out on the turn",
    "The lovers disappeared into the wood.",
    "I sat among the boughs of the fallen elm",
    "That strewed an angle of the fallow, and",
    "Watched the plough narrowing a yellow square",
    "Of charlock. Every time the horses turned",
    "Instead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned",
    "Upon the handles to say or ask a word,",
    "About the weather, next about the war.",
    "Scraping the share he faced towards the wood,",
    "And screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed",
    "Once more.",
    "The blizzard felled the elm whose crest",
    "I sat in, by a woodpecker\u2019s round hole,",
    "The ploughman said. \u201cWhen will they take it away?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen the war\u2019s over.\u201d So the talk began\u2014",
    "One minute and an interval of ten,",
    "A minute more and the same interval.",
    "\u201cHave you been out?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAnd don\u2019t want",
    "to, perhaps?\u201d",
    "\u201cIf I could only come back again, I should.",
    "I could spare an arm. I shouldn\u2019t want to lose",
    "A leg. If I should lose my head, why, so,",
    "I should want nothing more. . . . Have many gone",
    "From here?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cMany lost?\u201d \u201cYes, a good few.",
    "Only two teams work on the farm this year.",
    "One of my mates is dead. The second day",
    "In France they killed him. It was back in March,",
    "The very night of the blizzard, too. Now if",
    "He had stayed here we should have moved the tree.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd I should not have sat here. Everything",
    "Would have been different. For it would have been",
    "Another world.\u201d \u201cAy, and a better, though",
    "If we could see all all might seem good.\u201d Then",
    "The lovers came out of the wood again:",
    "The horses started and for the last time",
    "I watched the clods crumble and topple over",
    "After the ploughshare and the stumbling team."

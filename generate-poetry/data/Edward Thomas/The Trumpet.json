    "Rise up, rise up,",
    "And, as the trumpet blowing",
    "Chases the dreams of men,",
    "As the dawn glowing",
    "The stars that left unlit",
    "The land and water,",
    "Rise up and scatter",
    "The dew that covers",
    "The print of last night\u2019s lovers\u2014",
    "Scatter it, scatter it!",
    "While you are listening",
    "To the clear horn,",
    "Forget, men, everything",
    "On this earth newborn,",
    "Except that it is lovelier",
    "Than any mysteries.",
    "Open your eyes to the air",
    "That has washed the eyes of the stars",
    "Through all the dewy night:",
    "Up with the light,",
    "To the old wars;",
    "Arise, arise!"

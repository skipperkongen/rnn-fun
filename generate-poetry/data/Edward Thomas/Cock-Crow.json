    "Out of the wood of thoughts that grows by night",
    "To be cut down by the sharp axe of light,\u2014",
    "Out of the night, two cocks together crow,",
    "Cleaving the darkness with a silver blow:",
    "And bright before my eyes twin trumpeters stand,",
    "Heralds of splendour, one at either hand,",
    "Each facing each as in a coat of arms:",
    "The milkers lace their boots up at the farms."

    "The sun used to shine while we two walked",
    "Slowly together, paused and started",
    "Again, and sometimes mused, sometimes talked",
    "As either pleased, and cheerfully parted",
    "Each night. We never disagreed",
    "Which gate to rest on. The to be",
    "And the late past we gave small heed.",
    "We turned from men or poetry",
    "To rumours of the war remote",
    "Only till both stood disinclined",
    "For aught but the yellow flavorous coat",
    "Of an apple wasps had undermined;",
    "Or a sentry of dark betonies,",
    "The stateliest of small flowers on earth,",
    "At the forest verge; or crocuses",
    "Pale purple as if they had their birth",
    "In sunless Hades fields. The war",
    "Came back to mind with the moonrise",
    "Which soldiers in the east afar",
    "Beheld then. Nevertheless, our eyes",
    "Could as well imagine the Crusades",
    "Or Caesar's battles. Everything",
    "To faintness like those rumours fade\u2014",
    "Like the brook's water glittering",
    "Under the moonlight\u2014like those walks",
    "Now\u2014like us two that took them, and",
    "The fallen apples, all the talks",
    "And silence\u2014like memory's sand",
    "When the tide covers it late or soon,",
    "And other men through other flowers",
    "In those fields under the same moon",
    "Go talking and have easy hours."

    "One hour: as dim he and his house now look",
    "As a reflection in a rippling brook,",
    "While I remember him; but first, his house.",
    "Empty it sounded. It was dark with forest boughs",
    "That brushed the walls and made the mossy tiles",
    "Part of the squirrels\u2019 track. In all those miles",
    "Of forest silence and forest murmur, only",
    "One house\u2014\u201cLonely!\u201d he said, \u201cI wish it were lonely\u201d\u2014",
    "Which the trees looked upon from every side,",
    "And that was his.",
    "He waved good-bye to hide",
    "A sigh that he converted to a laugh.",
    "He seemed to hang rather than stand there, half",
    "Ghost-like, half like a beggar\u2019s rag, clean wrung",
    "And useless on the brier where it has hung",
    "Long years a-washing by sun and wind and rain.",
    "But why I call back man and house again",
    "Is that now on a beech-tree\u2019s tip I see",
    "As then I saw\u2014I at the gate, and he",
    "In the house darkness,\u2014a magpie veering about,",
    "A magpie like a weathercock in doubt."

    "I never saw that land before,",
    "And now can never see it again;",
    "Yet, as if by acquaintance hoar",
    "Endeared, by gladness and by pain,",
    "Great was the affection that I bore",
    "To the valley and the river small,",
    "The cattle, the grass, the bare ash trees,",
    "The chickens from the farmsteads, all",
    "Elm-hidden, and the tributaries",
    "Descending at equal interval;",
    "The blackthorns down along the brook",
    "With wounds yellow as crocuses",
    "Where yesterday the labourer\u2019s hook",
    "Had sliced them cleanly; and the breeze",
    "That hinted all and nothing spoke.",
    "I neither expected anything",
    "Nor yet remembered: but some goal",
    "I touched then; and if I could sing",
    "What would not even whisper my soul",
    "As I went on my journeying,",
    "I should use, as the trees and birds did,",
    "A language not to be betrayed;",
    "And what was hid should still be hid",
    "Excepting from those like me made",
    "Who answer when such whispers bid."

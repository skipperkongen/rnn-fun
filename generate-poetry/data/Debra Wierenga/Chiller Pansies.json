    "Your pansies died again today.",
    "All June I\u2019ve watched them scorch and fall",
    "by noon, their faces folding down",
    "to tissue-paper triangles.",
    "I bring them back with water, words,",
    "a pinch, but they are sick to death",
    "of resurrection. You planted them",
    "last fall, these \u201cChillers\u201d guaranteed",
    "to come again in spring. They returned",
    "in April\u2014you did not. You who said",
    "one day in 1963,",
    "and I, a daughter raised on love",
    "and miracles, believed it."

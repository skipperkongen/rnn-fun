    "Into the smouldering ruin now go down:",
    "And walk where once she walked and breathe the air",
    "She breathed that final day on the burning stair",
    "And follow her, beyond the fleeing crowds,",
    "Into the fire, and through the climbing clouds.",
    "Into the smouldering ruin now go down:",
    "And find, in ashes bright as hammered tin,",
    "A buried bone-white naked mannikin",
    "That flung from some shop window serves to bind",
    "Her body, and its beauty, to your mind."

    "Alone, unfriended, on a foreign shore,",
    "Behold an hapless, melancholy maid,",
    "Begging her scanty fare from door to door,",
    "With piteous voice, and humbly bended head.",
    "Alas! her native tongue is known to few:",
    "Her manners and her garb excite suprise;",
    "The vulgar stare to see her bid adieu;",
    "Her tattered garments fix their curious eyes.",
    "Cease, cease your laugh, ye thoughtless vain;",
    "Why sneer at yon poor Indian\u2019s pain?",
    "\u2019Tis nature\u2019s artless voice that speaks:",
    "Behold the tear bedew her cheeks!",
    "Imploring actions, bursting sighs,",
    "Reveal enough to British eyes."

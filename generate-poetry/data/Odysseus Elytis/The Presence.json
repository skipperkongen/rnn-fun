    "I walk in thorns in the dark",
    "of what\u2019s to happen and what has",
    "with my only weapon my only defense",
    "my nails purple like cyclamens.",
    "I saw her everywhere. Holding a glass and staring in space. Lying down",
    "listening to records. Walking the streets in wide trousers and an old",
    "gabardine. In front of children\u2019s-store windows. Sadder then. And in",
    "discotheques, more nervous, eating her nails. She smokes innumerable",
    "cigarettes. She is pale and beautiful. But if you talk to her she doesn\u2019t hear",
    "at all. As if something is happening \u2013 she alone hears it and is frightened.",
    "She holds your hand tight, tears, but is not",
    ". I never touched her and I",
    "never took from her anything.",
    "He understood nothing. He kept asking all the time \u201cRemember?\u201d What\u2019s to",
    "remember? My dreams alone I remember because I see them at night. Days",
    "I feel bad \u2013 how to say: unprepared. I found myself so suddenly, in life \u2013",
    "where I\u2019d hardly expected. I\u2019d say \u201cBah, I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d And everything",
    "around me ran. Things and people ran, ran \u2013 until I set myself to run like",
    "crazy. But, it seems, I overdid. Because \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 something strange",
    "happened in the end. First I\u2019d see the corpse and then the murder. First",
    "came the blood and then the blow and cry. And now, when I hear rain I don\u2019t",
    "know what\u2019s waiting...",
    "\u201cWhy don\u2019t they bury people standing up like archbishops?\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what",
    "she\u2019d say to me. And once, I remember, summer on the island, all of us",
    "coming from a party, dawn, we jumped over the bars of the museum\u2019s",
    "garden. She danced on the stones and she saw nothing.",
    "I saw his eyes. I saw some old olive groves.",
    "I saw a column on a grave. A girl in relief on the stone. She seemed sad",
    "and held a small bird in her cupped hand.",
    "He was looking at me, I know, he was looking at me. We both were looking",
    "at the same stone. We looked at each other through the stone.",
    "She was calm and in her palm she held a small bird.",
    "She was sitting and she was dead.",
    "She was sitting and in her palm she held a small bird.",
    "You\u2019ll never hold a bird like that \u2013 you aren\u2019t able.",
    "Oh if they let me, if they let me.",
    "If who let you?",
    "The one who lets nothing.",
    "He, he who lets nothing",
    "is cut by his shadow and walks away.",
    "His words are white and unspeakable",
    "his eyes deep and without sleep...",
    "But the whole upper part of the stone was taken. And with it her name.",
    "\u2013 as if I could still see the letters carved inside the light...",
    "...",
    "Gone. The whole top gone. There were no letters at all.",
    "\u2013 there, on the",
    "the stone had cut and broken. I remember",
    "it well.",
    "She must have seen it in a dream since she remembers.",
    "In my dreams, yes. In a large sleep that will come sometimes all light and",
    "heat and small stony steps. The children will walk in the streets arm in arm",
    "like in some old Italian movies. Song everywhere and enormous women in",
    "small balconies watering their flowers.",
    "A large blue balloon will take us high then, here and there, the wind will beat",
    "us. The silver domes will stand out first, then the belfries. The streets will",
    "appear narrower and straighter than we imagined. The terraces with the",
    "white television antennas. And all around the hills, and the kites \u2013 so close",
    "we\u2019ll just shave past them. Until one moment we\u2019ll see the whole sea. On it",
    "the souls will be leaving small white steams.",
    "I have lifted my hand against the mountains, the dark and the demonic of",
    "this world. I\u2019ve asked love \u201cWhy?\u201d and rolled her on the floor. War and war",
    "and not one rag to hide deep in our things and forget. Who listens? Who",
    "listened? Judges, priests, police, which is your country? One body is left me",
    "and I give it. On it those who know cultivate the holy, as the gardeners in",
    "Holland, tulips. And in it drown who never learned of sea or swimming... Flux",
    "of the sea and you stars\u2019 distant influx \u2013 stand by me!",
    "I have lifted my hand against the",
    "unexorcised demons of the world",
    "and from the place of illness I have exited",
    "to the sun and to the light self-exiled!",
    "And from too many storms I\u2019ve exited",
    "self among humans exiled!"

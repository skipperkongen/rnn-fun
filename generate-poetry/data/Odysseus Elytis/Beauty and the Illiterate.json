    "Often, in the Repose of Evening her soul took a lightness from",
    "the mountains across, although the day was harsh and",
    "tomorrow foreign.",
    "But, when it darkened well and out came the priest\u2019s hand over",
    "the little garden of the dead, She",
    "Alone, Standing, with the few domestics of the night\u2014the blowing",
    "rosemary and the murmur of smoke from the kilns\u2014",
    "at sea\u2019s entry, wakeful",
    "Otherly beauty!",
    "Only the waves\u2019 words half-guessed or in a rustle, and others",
    "resembling the dead\u2019s that startle in the cypress, strange",
    "zodiacs that lit up her magnetic moon-turned head.",
    "And one",
    "Unbelievable cleanliness allowed, to great depth in her, the real",
    "landscape to be seen,",
    "Where, near the river, the dark ones fought against the Angel,",
    "exactly showing how she\u2019s born, Beauty",
    "Or what we otherwise call tear.",
    "And long as her thinking lasted, you could feel it overflow the",
    "glowing sight bitterly in the eyes and the huge, like an",
    "ancient prostitute\u2019s, cheekbones",
    "Stretched to the extreme points of the Large Dog and of the Virgin.",
    "\u201cFar from the pestilential city I dreamed of her deserted place",
    "where a tear may have no meaning and the only light be",
    "from the flame that ravishes all that for me exists.",
    "\u201cShoulder-to-shoulder under what will be, sworn to extreme silence",
    "and the co-ruling of the stars,",
    "\u201cAs if I didn\u2019t know yet, the illiterate, that there exactly, in extreme",
    "silence are the most repellent thuds",
    "\u201cAnd that, since it became unbearable inside a man\u2019s chest, solitude",
    "dispersed and seeded stars!\u201d"

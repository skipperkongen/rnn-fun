    "Without meaningful speech or musical equipoise,",
    "Annoyances none but",
    "Through our winding whispering galleries resound",
    "Unwelcome,",
    "Us with that ubiquitous nuisance, noise,",
    "Which may take the shape of inflated reputation,",
    "Able neither to stun, astonish nor astound",
    "Those whom obscene publicity annoys,",
    "Who prefer the decent obscurity of publication.",
    "&",
    "Regardless of the weird world\u2019s disregard,",
    "These works may be devoted to the wastebasket",
    "Like the forgotten forgeries of some casket",
    "Letters, scored for posterity",
    "By repentance. Sentenced to a futility of hard",
    "Leisure, answer nothing but the task it",
    "Asks, apart from any eternal return.",
    "Perhaps a masterpiece, unmade, unmarred,",
    "Awaits the patient skill that will unmask it.",
    "A lifetime passes as the phrases turn.",
    "Immured in a single-occupancy cell,",
    "How all manner of things shall nevertheless be well,",
    "Will a celibate selfish as a shellfish spell",
    "Out a corrupt",
    "So that each deleted syllable counts?",
    "Solitude is helpless to dispel",
    "Questions as exceptionably vexed",
    "As unaccountable love\u2019s unaudited accounts.",
    "To keep your cell the way you keep your soul,",
    "Untidy-minded, neither soiled nor sold",
    "For next to nothing, a treasury of old",
    "Notions like the notes of a piano-roll",
    "Which cannot improvise though it knows a whole",
    "Repertoire, what ought one to withhold?",
    "Idiosyncrasy is nobody else\u2019s business.",
    "Of all omens the soul provides the sole",
    "Depository. How many oceans can it hold",
    "In its infinite",
    "Sealed",
    "Turned our intimate alcove into a closet",
    "Concealed behind a dirty bookcase: was it",
    "A conservatory or a living room,",
    "This stanza become a catacomb or tomb",
    "That serves as a temporary safe deposit",
    "Vault for your perduring lost",
    "Mind, which articulately could presume",
    "To ask of being what could cause it,",
    "A question as unanswerable as profound.",
    "Up the steps of imperfection we stumble",
    "Blind upstarts, our feeble feet astray",
    "Panting after perfections we are no more able",
    "To encompass than an imaginative animal.",
    "While some describe the world as round as a ball,",
    "Others maintain that it is flat like a table.",
    "Its shape is immaterial, there like the air.",
    "Better, perhaps, to be sorry than safe after all,",
    "Seeing no security could enable",
    "One to scale unscathed the inexorable stair."

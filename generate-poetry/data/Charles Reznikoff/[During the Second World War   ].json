    "During the Second World War, I was going home one night",
    "along a street I seldom used. All the stores were closed",
    "except one\u2014a small fruit store.",
    "An old Italian was inside to wait on customers.",
    "As I was paying him I saw that he was sad.",
    "\u201cYou are sad,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is troubling you?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI am sad.\u201d Then he added",
    "in the same monotone, not looking at me:",
    "\u201cMy son left for the front today and I\u2019ll never see him again.\u201d",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d I said. \u201cOf course, you will!\u201d",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll never see him again.\u201d",
    "Afterwards, when the war was over,",
    "I found myself once more in that street",
    "and again it was late at night, dark and lonely;",
    "and again I saw the old man alone in the store.",
    "I bought some apples and looked closely at him:",
    "his thin wrinkled face was grim",
    "but not particularly sad. \u201cHow about your son?\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cDid he come back from the war?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he answered.",
    "\u201cHe was not wounded?\u201d \u201cNo. He is all right.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cFine!\u201d",
    "He took the bag of apples from my hands and groping inside",
    "took out one that had begun to rot",
    "and put in a good one instead.",
    "\u201cHe came back at Christmas,\u201d he added.",
    "\u201cHow wonderful! That was wonderful!\u201d",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d he said gently, \u201cit was wonderful.\u201d",
    "He took the bag of apples from my hands again",
    "and took out one of the smaller apples and put in a large one."

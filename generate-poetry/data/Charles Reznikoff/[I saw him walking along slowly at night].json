    "I saw him walking along slowly at night",
    "holding a tray of candy and chewing-gum:",
    "a Jewish boy of fifteen or sixteen",
    "with large black eyes and a gentle face.",
    "He sidled into a saloon",
    "and must have been ordered away",
    "because he came out promptly",
    "through the swinging doors.",
    "I wondered what he was doing",
    "far from a Jewish neighborhood.",
    "(I knew the side streets",
    "and the roughs standing about on the corners and stoops.)",
    "What a prize this shambling boy with his tray!",
    "I stepped up to warn him",
    "against leaving the brightly-lit avenue.",
    "He listened, eyed me steadily, and walked on calmly.",
    "I looked at him in astonishment",
    "and thought: has nothing frightened you?",
    "Neither the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, by the",
    "Romans, by the Crusaders?",
    "No pogrom in Russia;",
    "no Nazi death-camp in Germany?",
    "How can you still go about so calmly?"

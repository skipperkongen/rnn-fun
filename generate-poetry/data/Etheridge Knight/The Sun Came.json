    "The sun came, Miss Brooks,\u2014",
    "After all the night years.",
    "He came spitting fire from his lips.",
    "And we flipped\u2014We goofed the whole thing.",
    "It looks like our ears were not equipped",
    "For the fierce hammering.",
    "And now the Sun has gone, has bled red,",
    "Weeping behind the hills.",
    "Again the night shadows form.",
    "But beneath the placid face a storm rages.",
    "The rays of Red have pierced the deep, have struck",
    "The core. We cannot sleep.",
    "The shadows sing: Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.",
    "The darkness ain't like before.",
    "The Sun came, Miss Brooks.",
    "And we goofed the whole thing.",
    "I think.",
    "(Though ain't no vision visited my cell.)"

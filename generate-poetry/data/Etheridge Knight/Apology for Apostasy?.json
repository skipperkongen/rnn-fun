    "Soft songs, like birds, die in poison air",
    "So my song cannot now be candy.",
    "Anger rots the oak and elm; roses are rare,",
    "Seldom seen through blind despair.",
    "And my murmur cannot be heard",
    "Above the din and damn. The night is full",
    "Of buggers and bastards; no moon or stars",
    "Light the sky. And my candy is deferred",
    "Till peacetime, when my voice shall be light,",
    "Like down, lilting in the air; then shall I",
    "Sing of beaches, white in the magic sun,",
    "And of moons and maidens at midnight."

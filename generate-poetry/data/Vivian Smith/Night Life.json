    "Disturbed at 2 a.m. I hear a claw",
    "scratching the window, tapping at the pane,",
    "and then I realise, a broken branch,",
    "and yet I can\u2019t turn back to sleep again.",
    "Slowly, not to wake you, I get up,",
    "thinking of food, perhaps a quiet read.",
    "A cockroach runs across the kitchen floor,",
    "its lacquered shell as quick and dry as seed.",
    "Outside the chalice lily lifts its cup",
    "in adoration to the mirrored moon,",
    "full of purpose as it trembles there,",
    "collecting drops of moisture on its spoon.",
    "Noises of the night, it\u2019s all alive,",
    "birds shifting in the steady trees,",
    "slugs and snails eating fallen flowers,",
    "a moth freighted with fragilities.",
    "Nocturnal life, the other side of things,",
    "proceeding whether we observe or not,",
    "like rows and rows of brown coastal ants",
    "transporting food from here to another spot."

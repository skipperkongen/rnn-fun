    "are concrete stairs that lead one",
    "(or at least led me, age six)",
    "near straight from top to bottom of a cliff face",
    "they ended in a black-sand beach",
    "\u201cthe only",
    "constant in my life.",
    "When I was young I would have thought",
    "I would regret it, to have wrapped",
    "myself up like a caterpillar",
    "in a man\u2014but if my name, like his,",
    "is Vogelsang, then I must half recede",
    "with him",
    "only half of me is Julia. And that fades too.",
    "So call me, if",
    "you call me, Mrs. Vogelsang.\u201d",
    "At that age, having lived before in Florida,",
    "it seemed like",
    "a miraculous affront",
    "that a beach",
    "could shuffle off the purity of sand",
    "satisfying to have seen it after the descent",
    "of stairs",
    "at least three hundred, each laborious",
    "at six",
    "my body hardly large enough to bear",
    "its density in time\u2014",
    "Knowing little, still I felt",
    "exhilaration that a new piece of world",
    "would stand (if briefly) out of time",
    "therefore out of me",
    "if I am what I occupy of it",
    ". . . The body hates to be discounted",
    "in this way, says it encloses",
    "any love the heart pretends to,",
    "like the stairs,",
    "a downward tedium but still the necessary",
    "setting of the beach, as gems",
    "are set in rings that,",

    "impotence I thought myself in part",
    "if not entirely",
    "responsible,",
    "I ascribed the blame",
    "to our, admittedly, unsensational sex habits,",
    "to our bed not cold, perhaps, but let\u2019s be frank",
    "a little bored with us. Therefore,",
    "thirty-eight",
    "only just confronted with",
    "my inexperience that bordered on",
    "extended childhood, I contemplated, then resolved",

    "my husband",
    "I, if you will excuse",
    "vulgarity, fucked constantly when young",
    "not infrequently until this roadblock\u2014but",
    "it struck me somehow as",
    "unseemly hitherto. My husband",
    "when I told him what I meant to do",
    "looked pleased, as though",
    "decorum only kept him",
    "twenty years long",
    "from requesting it. He tried",
    "to guide me",
    "as I started, both his hands",
    "like tethers not unkind to what they hold\u2014",
    "And he was kind to me, spoke kindly as I ran",
    "my tongue across him, tasting faintly",
    "of his sweat but not unpleasant. On the whole",
    "not bad to do this, though",
    "my faith flagged somewhat",
    "as his prick lay flaccid in my mouth,",
    "its stubbornness",
    "infuriating. I could feel his disappointment,",
    "selfish maybe but no more so",
    "than is fair in love, for he, of course,",

    "it had been a while by now.",
    "She had told me, long my friend",
    "full of guilt. I told her",
    "bitterness was foreign to me",

    "that she shouldn\u2019t",

    "that I could do to change what they",
    "had done\u2014",
    "I believed",
    "at that time, as I said, I was",
    "responsible, could mend it",
    "so he\u2019d never feel the need",
    "to cheat again. Can\u2019t know now",
    "whether I was right, though sometimes",
    "I consider asking him\u2014as I considered",
    "then, but as I built my courage up",
    "he stiffened.",
    "And I threw",
    "my heart into the act, as one",
    "who plows the earth with spite for it,",

    "* * *",
    "\u201cMy love",
    "consoles me greatly",
    "but is love no less for that",

    "of longing to experience the object\u2014",

    "the matter over, celebrate",
    "the isolation",
    "one cannot alleviate through",
    "laughter, set the problem",
    "to the side. Friendship,",
    "unlike love, will not destroy us",

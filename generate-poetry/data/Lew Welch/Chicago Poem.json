    "I lived here nearly 5 years before I could",
    "meet the middle western day with anything approaching",
    "Dignity. It\u2019s a place that lets you",
    "understand why the Bible is the way it is:",
    "Proud people cannot live here.",
    "The land\u2019s too flat. Ugly sullen and big it",
    "pounds men down past humbleness. They",
    "Stoop at 35 possibly cringing from the heavy and",
    "terrible sky. In country like this there",
    "Can be no God but Jahweh.",
    "In the mills and refineries of its south side Chicago",
    "passes its natural gas in flames",
    "Bouncing like bunsens from stacks a hundred feet high.",
    "The stench stabs at your eyeballs.",
    "The whole sky green and yellow backdrop for the skeleton",
    "steel of a bombed-out town.",
    "Remember the movies in grammar school? The goggled men",
    "doing strong things in",
    "Showers of steel-spark? The dark screen cracking light",
    "and the furnace door opening with a",
    "Blast of orange like a sunset? Or an orange?",
    "It was photographed by a fairy, thrilled as a girl, or",
    "a Nazi who wished there were people",
    "Behind that door (hence the remote beauty), but Sievers,",
    "whose old man spent most of his life in there,",
    "Remembers a \u201cnigger in a red T-shirt pissing into the",
    "black sand.\u201d",
    "It was 5 years until I could afford to recognize the ferocity.",
    "Friends helped me. Then I put some",
    "Love into my house. Finally I found some quiet lakes",
    "and a farm where they let me shoot pheasant.",
    "Standing in the boat one night I watched the lake go",
    "absolutely flat. Smaller than raindrops, and only",
    "Here and there, the feeding rings of fish were visible a hundred",
    "yards away \u2014 and the Blue Gill caught that afternoon",
    "Lifted from its northern lake like a tropical! Jewel at its ear",
    "Belly gold so bright you\u2019d swear he had a",
    "Light in there. His color faded with his life. A small",
    "green fish . . .",
    "All things considered, it\u2019s a gentle and undemanding",
    "planet, even here. Far gentler",
    "Here than any of a dozen other places. The trouble is",
    "always and only with what we build on top of it.",
    "There\u2019s nobody else to blame. You can\u2019t fix it and you",
    "can\u2019t make it go away. It does no good appealing",
    "To some ill-invented Thunderer",
    "Brooding above some unimaginable crag . . .",
    "It\u2019s ours. Right down to the last small hinge it",
    "all depends for its existence",
    "Only and utterly upon our sufferance.",
    "Driving back I saw Chicago rising in its gases and I",
    "knew again that never will the",
    "Man be made to stand against this pitiless, unparalleled",
    "monstrocity. It",
    "Snuffles on the beach of its Great Lake like a",
    "blind, red, rhinoceros.",
    "It\u2019s already running us down.",
    "You can\u2019t fix it. You can\u2019t make it go away.",
    "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to do about it,",
    "But I know what I\u2019m going to do about it. I\u2019m just",
    "going to walk away from it. Maybe",
    "A small part of it will die if I\u2019m not around",
    "feeding it anymore."

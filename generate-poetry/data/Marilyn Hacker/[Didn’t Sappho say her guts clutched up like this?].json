    "Didn\u2019t Sappho say her guts clutched up like this?",
    "Before a face suddenly numinous,",
    "her eyes watered, knees melted. Did she lactate",
    "again, milk brought down by a girl\u2019s kiss?",
    "It\u2019s documented torrents are unloosed",
    "by such events as recently produced",
    "not the wish, but the need, to consume, in us,",
    "one pint of Maalox, one of Kaopectate.",
    "My eyes and groin are permanently swollen,",
    "I\u2019m alternatingly brilliant and witless",
    "\u2014and sleepless: bed is just a swamp to roll in.",
    "Although I\u2019d cream my jeans touching your breast,",
    "sweetheart, it isn\u2019t lust; it\u2019s all the rest",
    "of what I want with you that scares me shitless."

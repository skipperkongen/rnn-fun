    "It had to be from someone whose grandparents were born in Shanghai",
    "not the city\u2019s greatest citizens, but certainly among the sober ones",
    "to make their small now eroded mark",
    "It had to be from a distant or dissolute descendant (yes,",
    ")",
    "who can sing praises unworthy of even a flicker of your attention",
    "Doesn\u2019t this sound like it might turn into a love poem or a prayer",
    "Well, you are wrong, because a man of the people,",
    "which I am not nor will I ever be,",
    "doesn\u2019t single out one above all others",
    "as this is a hierarchical construction",
    "and therefore undemocratic and antihumanist",
    "It had to be from someone whose virtues do not include stubbornness,",
    "patience, gentleness, loyalty, or truthfulness",
    "It had to be from someone who could take my place",
    "after I left the room",
    "never to return",
    "It had to be from someone who didn\u2019t exist",
    "before this poem",
    "began writing itself down"

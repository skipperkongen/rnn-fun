    "On the day I set out on the climb,",
    "grief saddled in my back like a bag of marbles,",
    "my breath like clouds hanging on the low peaks of a mountain,",
    "on the day I set out",
    "leaving nothing behind, nothing on the bed, no version of myself,",
    "just my voice through the night, the voice I use to ward off nightmares.",
    "(My voice is a still life in itself, a shroud green and ultramarine deep blue,",
    "a bowl of apples and tangerines on a table.)",
    "On the day I set out,",
    "the mountain is high in front of me, the unreliable god of mist and fog.",
    "I have no voice to say how high",
    "my fingers must lift as if on a lover's upper lip,",
    "to take in the breath of how high my mountain is\u2014white teeth behind",
    "a snow cap, numberless springs, cold like the enzymes in spit\u2014",
    "a version of me is still asleep: the moving of a limb in sleep.",
    "Everything becomes lucid."

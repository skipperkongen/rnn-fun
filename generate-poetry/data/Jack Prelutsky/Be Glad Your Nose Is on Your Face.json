    "Be glad your nose is on your face,",

    "Imagine if your precious nose",
    "were sandwiched in between your toes,",
    "that clearly would not be a treat,",
    "for you\u2019d be forced to smell your feet.",
    "Your nose would be a source of dread",
    "were it attached atop your head,",
    "it soon would drive you to despair,",
    "forever tickled by your hair.",
    "Within your ear, your nose would be",
    "an absolute catastrophe,",
    "for when you were obliged to sneeze,",
    "your brain would rattle from the breeze.",
    "Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,",
    "remains between your eyes and chin,",
    "not pasted on some other place\u2014",
    "be glad your nose is on your face!"

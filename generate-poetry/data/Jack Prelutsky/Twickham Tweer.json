    "Shed a tear for Twickham Tweer",
    "who ate uncommon meals,",
    "who often peeled bananas",
    "and then only ate the peels,",
    "who emptied jars of marmalade",
    "and only ate the jars,",
    "and only ate the wrappers",
    "off of chocolate candy bars.",
    "When Twickham cooked a chicken",
    "he would only eat the bones,",
    "he discarded scoops of ice cream",
    "though he always ate the cones,",
    "he\u2019d boil a small potato",
    "but he\u2019d only eat the skin,",
    "and pass up canned asparagus",
    "to gobble down the tin.",
    "He sometimes dined on apple cores",
    "and bags of peanut shells,",
    "on cottage cheese containers,",
    "cellophane from caramels,",
    "but Twickham Tweer passed on last year,",
    "that odd and novel man,",
    "when he fried an egg one morning",
    "and then ate the frying pan."

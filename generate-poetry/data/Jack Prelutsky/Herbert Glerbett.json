    "Herbert Glerbett, rather round,",

    "and from the mess a thing evolved\u2014",
    "a thing that is a ghastly green,",
    "a thing the world had never seen,",
    "a puddle thing, a gooey pile",
    "of something strange that does not smile.",
    "Now if you\u2019re wise, and if you\u2019re sly,",
    "you\u2019ll swiftly pass this creature by,",
    "it is no longer Herbert Glerbett.",

    "I found a four-leaf clover",
    "and was happy with my find,",
    "but with time to think it over,",
    "I\u2019ve entirely changed my mind.",
    "I concealed it in my pocket,",
    "safe inside a paper pad,",
    "soon, much swifter than a rocket,",
    "my good fortune turned to bad.",
    "I smashed my fingers in a door,",
    "I dropped a dozen eggs,",
    "I slipped and tumbled to the floor,",
    "a dog nipped both my legs,",
    "my ring slid down the bathtub drain,",
    "my pen leaked on my shirt,",
    "I barked my shin, I missed my train,",
    "I sat on my dessert.",
    "I broke my brand-new glasses,",
    "and I couldn\u2019t find my keys,",
    "I stepped in spilled molasses,",
    "and was stung by angry bees.",
    "When the kitten ripped the curtain,",
    "and the toast burst into flame,",
    "I was absolutely certain",
    "that the clover was to blame.",
    "I buried it discreetly",
    "in the middle of a field,",
    "now my luck has changed completely,",
    "and my wounds have almost healed.",
    "If I ever find another,",
    "I will simply let it be,",
    "or I\u2019ll give it to my brother\u2014",
    "he deserves it more than me."

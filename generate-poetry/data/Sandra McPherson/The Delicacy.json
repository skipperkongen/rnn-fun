    "Friend, remember how you showed us beasts love beauty?",
    "We were wading in your lake with bluegills and you said,",
    "Be careful, you will lose your beauty marks",
    "To their little jaws. We were a delicacy. From us they purchased",
    "The darkest part of the skin, only what contrasts on us.",
    "And it was more than a pinch or sting,",
    "It\u2019s a sensation of hunger",
    "That makes us spring off the bottom and swim out deep",
    "And safe. \u201cNo blue stripes on cheeks; no red on fins;",
    "Old individual\u2019s belly coppery red or brassy.\u201d",
    "As others see you, I think these indicate,",
    "Who would have you all one shade then wouldn\u2019t have you.",
    "At your full table later, over muskellunge and lemon,",
    "We read in the book the fish that liked us",
    "Has certain maxillaries \u201cwholly wanting.\u201d Your gourmet bluegill:",
    "It lives in the eye of the beholder, it swims the vitreous",
    "Humor, would eat even your blind spot!",
    "But we think we can paddle out there until all",
    "Goes dark, and we are wholly desirable, and too much."

    "How valuable it is in these short days,",
    "threading through empty maple branches,",
    "the lacy-needled sugar pines.",
    "Its glint off sheets of ice tells the story",
    "of Death\u2019s brightness, her bitter cold.",
    "We can make do with so little, just the hint",
    "of warmth, the slanted light.",
    "The way we stand there, soaking in it,",
    "mittened fingers reaching.",
    "And how carefully we gather what we can",
    "to offer later, in darkness, one body to another."

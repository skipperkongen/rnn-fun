    "Early December, dusk, and the sky",
    "slips down the rungs of its blue ladder",
    "into indigo. A late-quarter moon hangs",
    "in the air above the ridge like a broken plate",
    "and shines on us all, on the new deputy",
    "almost asleep in his four-by-four,",
    "lulled by the crackling song of the dispatcher,",
    "on the bartender, slowly wiping a glass",
    "and racking it, one eye checking the game.",
    "It shines down on the fox\u2019s red and grey life,",
    "as he stills, a shadow beside someone\u2019s gate,",
    "listening to winter. Its pale gaze caresses",
    "the lovers, curled together under a quilt,",
    "dreaming alone, and shines on the scattered",
    "ashes of terrible fires, on the owl\u2019s black flight,",
    "on the whelks, on the murmuring kelp,",
    "on the whale that washed up six weeks ago",
    "at the base of the dunes, and it shines",
    "on the backhoe that buried her."

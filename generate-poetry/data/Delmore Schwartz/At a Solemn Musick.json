    "Let the musicians begin,",
    "Let every instrument awaken and instruct us",
    "In love\u2019s willing river and love\u2019s dear discipline:",
    "We wait, silent, in consent and in the penance",
    "Of patience, awaiting the serene exaltation",
    "Which is the liberation and conclusion of expiation.",
    "Now may the chief musician say:",
    "Like barbarous kings: have conquered us:",
    "Have inhabited our hearts: devoured and ravished",
    "\u2014With the savage greed and avarice of fire\u2014",
    "The substance of pity and compassion.\u201d",
    "Now may all the players play:",
    "Flow out of the splendor of the tenderness of surrender.\u201d",
    "Now may the chief musician say:",
    "And now the entire choir shall chant:",
    "Beholding the laurel,",
    "Remembers the dead,",
    "And the enchanted absolute,",
    "Snow\u2019s kingdom, sleep\u2019s dominion.\u201d",
    "Then shall the chief musician declare:",
    "Until the dream is knowledge and knowledge is a dream.\u201d",
    "And then, once again, the entire choir shall cry, in passionate unity,",
    "Singing and celebrating love and love\u2019s victory,",
    "Ascending and descending the heights of assent, climbing and chanting triumphantly:",
    "Before the snow shone,",
    "And the light sang, and the stone,",
    "Abiding, rode the fullness or endured the emptiness,",
    "You were: you were alone."

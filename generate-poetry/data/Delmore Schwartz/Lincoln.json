    "This tricky lawyer full of black despair\u2014",
    "He grew a beard, becoming President,",
    "And took a shawl as if he guessed his role,",
    "Though with the beard he fled cartoonists\u2019 blacks,",
    "And many laughed and were contemptuous,",
    "And some for four years spoke of killing him\u2014",

    "It was for him, before Election Day,",
    "That at Cold Harbor Grant threw lives away",
    "In hopeless frontal attack against Lee\u2019s breastworks!",

    "His wife went insane, Mary Todd too often",
    "Bought herself dresses. And his child died.",
    "And he would not condemn young men to death",
    "For having slept, in weakness. And he spoke",
    "More than he knew and all that he had felt",
    "Between outrageous joy and black despair",
    "Before and after Gettysburg\u2019s pure peak\u2014",
    "He studied law, but knew in his own soul",
    "Despair\u2019s anarchy, terror and error,",
    "\u2014Instruments had to be taken from his office",
    "And from his bedroom in such days of horror,",

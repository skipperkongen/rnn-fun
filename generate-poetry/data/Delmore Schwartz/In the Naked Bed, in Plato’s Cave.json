    "In the naked bed, in Plato\u2019s cave,",
    "Reflected headlights slowly slid the wall,",
    "Carpenters hammered under the shaded window,",
    "Wind troubled the window curtains all night long,",
    "A fleet of trucks strained uphill, grinding,",
    "Their freights covered, as usual.",
    "The ceiling lightened again, the slanting diagram",
    "Slid slowly forth.",
    "Hearing the milkman\u2019s chop,",
    "His striving up the stair, the bottle\u2019s chink,",
    "I rose from bed, lit a cigarette,",
    "And walked to the window. The stony street",
    "Displayed the stillness in which buildings stand,",
    "The street-lamp\u2019s vigil and the horse\u2019s patience.",
    "The winter sky\u2019s pure capital",
    "Turned me back to bed with exhausted eyes.",
    "Strangeness grew in the motionless air. The loose",
    "Film grayed. Shaking wagons, hooves\u2019 waterfalls,",
    "Sounded far off, increasing, louder and nearer.",
    "A car coughed, starting. Morning, softly",
    "Melting the air, lifted the half-covered chair",
    "From underseas, kindled the looking-glass,",
    "Distinguished the dresser and the white wall.",
    "The bird called tentatively, whistled, called,",
    "Bubbled and whistled, so! Perplexed, still wet",
    "With sleep, affectionate, hungry and cold. So, so,",
    "O son of man, the ignorant night, the travail",
    "Of early morning, the mystery of beginning",
    "Again and again,",
    "while History is unforgiven."

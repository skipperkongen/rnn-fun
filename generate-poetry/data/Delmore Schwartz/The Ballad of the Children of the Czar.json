    "The children of the Czar",
    "Played with a bouncing ball",
    "In the May morning, in the Czar\u2019s garden,",
    "Tossing it back and forth.",
    "It fell among the flowerbeds",
    "Or fled to the north gate.",
    "A daylight moon hung up",
    "In the Western sky, bald white.",
    "Like Papa\u2019s face, said Sister,",
    "Hurling the white ball forth.",
    "While I ate a baked potato",
    "Six thousand miles apart,",
    "In Brooklyn, in 1916,",
    "Aged two, irrational.",
    "When Franklin D. Roosevelt",
    "Was an Arrow Collar ad.",
    "O Nicholas! Alas! Alas!",
    "My grandfather coughed in your army,",
    "Hid in a wine-stinking barrel,",
    "For three days in Bucharest",
    "Then left for America",
    "To become a king himself.",
    "I am my father\u2019s father,",
    "You are your children\u2019s guilt.",
    "In history\u2019s pity and terror",
    "The child is Aeneas again;",
    "Troy is in the nursery,",
    "The rocking horse is on fire.",
    "Child labor! The child must carry",
    "His fathers on his back.",
    "But seeing that so much is past",
    "And that history has no ruth",
    "For the individual,",
    "Who drinks tea, who catches cold,",
    "Let anger be general:",
    "I hate an abstract thing.",
    "Brother and sister bounced",
    "The bounding, unbroken ball,",
    "The shattering sun fell down",
    "Like swords upon their play,",
    "Moving eastward among the stars",
    "Toward February and October.",
    "But the Maywind brushed their cheeks",
    "Like a mother watching sleep,",
    "And if for a moment they fight",
    "Over the bouncing ball",
    "And sister pinches brother",
    "And brother kicks her shins,",
    "Well! The heart of man is known:",
    "It is a cactus bloom.",
    "The ground on which the ball bounces",
    "Is another bouncing ball.",
    "The wheeling, whirling world",
    "Makes no will glad.",
    "Spinning in its spotlight darkness,",
    "It is too big for their hands.",
    "A pitiless, purposeless Thing,",
    "Arbitrary and unspent,",
    "Made for no play, for no children,",
    "But chasing only itself.",
    "The innocent are overtaken,",
    "They are not innocent.",
    "They are their father\u2019s fathers,",
    "The past is inevitable.",
    "Now, in another October",
    "Of this tragic star,",
    "I see my second year,",
    "I eat my baked potato.",
    "It is my buttered world,",
    "But, poked by my unlearned hand,",
    "It falls from the highchair down",
    "And I begin to howl.",
    "And I see the ball roll under",
    "The iron gate which is locked.",
    "Sister is screaming, brother is howling,",
    "The ball has evaded their will.",
    "Even a bouncing ball",
    "Is uncontrollable,",
    "And is under the garden wall.",
    "I am overtaken by terror",
    "Thinking of my father\u2019s fathers,",
    "And of my own will."

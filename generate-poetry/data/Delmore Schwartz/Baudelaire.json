    "When I fall asleep, and even during sleep,",
    "I hear, quite distinctly, voices speaking",
    "Whole phrases, commonplace and trivial,",
    "Having no relation to my affairs.",
    "Dear Mother, is any time left to us",
    "In which to be happy? My debts are immense.",
    "My bank account is subject to the court\u2019s judgment.",
    "I know nothing. I cannot know anything.",
    "I have lost the ability to make an effort.",
    "But now as before my love for you increases.",
    "You are always armed to stone me, always:",
    "It is true. It dates from childhood.",
    "For the first time in my long life",
    "I am almost happy. The book, almost finished,",
    "Almost seems good. It will endure, a monument",
    "To my obsessions, my hatred, my disgust.",
    "Debts and inquietude persist and weaken me.",
    "Satan glides before me, saying sweetly:",
    "\u201cRest for a day! You can rest and play today.",
    "Tonight you will work.\u201d When night comes,",
    "My mind, terrified by the arrears,",
    "Bored by sadness, paralyzed by impotence,",
    "Promises: \u201cTomorrow: I will tomorrow.\u201d",
    "Tomorrow the same comedy enacts itself",
    "With the same resolution, the same weakness.",
    "I am sick of this life of furnished rooms.",
    "I am sick of having colds and headaches:",
    "You know my strange life. Every day brings",
    "Its quota of wrath. You little know",
    "A poet\u2019s life, dear Mother: I must write poems,",
    "The most fatiguing of occupations.",
    "I am sad this morning. Do not reproach me.",
    "I write from a caf\u00e9 near the post office,",
    "Amid the click of billiard balls, the clatter of dishes,",
    "The pounding of my heart. I have been asked to write",
    "\u201cA History of Caricature.\u201d I have been asked to write",
    "\u201cA History of Sculpture.\u201d Shall I write a history",
    "Of the caricatures of the sculptures of you in my heart?",
    "Although it costs you countless agony,",
    "Although you cannot believe it necessary,",
    "And doubt that the sum is accurate,",
    "Please send me money enough for at least three weeks."

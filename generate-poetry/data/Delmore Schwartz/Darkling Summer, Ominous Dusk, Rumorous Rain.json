    "1",
    "A tattering of rain and then the reign",
    "Of pour and pouring-down and down,",
    "Where in the westward gathered the filming gown",
    "Of grey and clouding weakness, and, in the mane",
    "Of the light\u2019s glory and the day\u2019s splendor, gold and vain,",
    "Vivid, more and more vivid, scarlet, lucid and more luminous,",
    "Then came a splatter, a prattle, a blowing rain!",
    "And soon the hour was musical and rumorous:",
    "A softness of a dripping lipped the isolated houses,",
    "A gaunt grey somber softness licked the glass of hours.",
    "2",
    "Again, after a catbird squeaked in the special silence,",
    "And clouding vagueness fogged the windowpane",
    "And gathered blackness and overcast, the mane",
    "Of light\u2019s story and light\u2019s glory surrendered and ended",
    "\u2014A pebble\u2014a ring\u2014a ringing on the pane,",
    "A blowing and a blowing in: tides of the blue and cold",
    "Moods of the great blue bay, and slates of grey",
    "Came down upon the land\u2019s great sea, the body of this day",
    "\u2014Hardly an atom of silence amid the roar",
    "Allowed the voice to form appeal\u2014to call:",
    "By kindled light we thought we saw the bronze of fall."

    "\u2018The nightingales won\u2019t let you sleep in Platres.\u2019",
    "Shy nightingale, in the breathing of the leaves,",
    "you who bestow the forest\u2019s musical coolness",
    "on the sundered bodies, on the souls",
    "of those who know they will not return.",
    "Blind voice, you who grope in the darkness of memory",
    "for footsteps and gestures \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t dare say kisses \u2014",
    "and the bitter raving of the frenzied slave-woman.",
    "\u2018The nightingales won\u2019t let you sleep in Platres.\u2019",
    "Platres: where is Platres? And this island: who knows it?",
    "I\u2019ve lived my life hearing names I\u2019ve never heard before:",
    "new countries, new idiocies of men",
    "or of the gods;",
    "my fate, which wavers",
    "between the last sword of some Ajax",
    "and another Salamis,",
    "brought me here, to this shore.",
    "The moon",
    "rose from the sea like Aphrodite,",
    "covered the Archer\u2019s stars, now moves to find",
    "the heart of Scorpio, and alters everything.",
    "Truth, where\u2019s the truth?",
    "I too was an archer in the war;",
    "my fate: that of a man who missed his target.",
    "Lyric nightingale,",
    "on a night like this, by the shore of Proteus,",
    "the Spartan slave-girls heard you and began their lament,",
    "and among them \u2014 who would have believed it? \u2014 Helen!",
    "She whom we hunted so many years by the banks of the Scamander.",
    "She was there, at the desert\u2019s lip; I touched her; she spoke to me:",
    "\u2018It isn\u2019t true, it isn\u2019t true,\u2019 she cried.",
    "\u2018I didn\u2019t board the blue bowed ship.",
    "I never went to valiant Troy.\u2019",
    "Breasts girded high, the sun in her hair, and that stature",
    "shadows and smiles everywhere,",
    "on shoulders, thighs and knees;",
    "the skin alive, and her eyes",
    "with the large eyelids,",
    "she was there, on the banks of a Delta.",
    "And at Troy?",
    "At Troy, nothing: just a phantom image.",
    "That\u2019s how the gods wanted it.",
    "And Paris, Paris lay with a shadow as though it were a solid being;",
    "and for ten whole years we slaughtered ourselves for Helen.",
    "Great suffering had desolated Greece.",
    "So many bodies thrown",
    "into the jaws of the sea, the jaws of the earth",
    "so many souls",
    "fed to the millstones like grain.",
    "And the rivers swelling, blood in their silt,",
    "all for a linen undulation, a filmy cloud,",
    "a butterfly\u2019s flicker, a wisp of swan\u2019s down,",
    "an empty tunic \u2014 all for a Helen.",
    "And my brother?",
    "Nightingale nightingale nightingale,",
    "what is a god? What is not a god? And what is there in between them?",
    "\u2018The nightingales won\u2019t let you sleep in Platres.\u2019",
    "Tearful bird,",
    "on sea-kissed Cyprus",
    "consecrated to remind me of my country,",
    "I moored alone with this fable,",
    "if it\u2019s true that it is a fable,",
    "if it\u2019s true that mortals will not again take up",
    "the old deceit of the gods;",

    "that in future years some other Teucer,",
    "or some Ajax or Priam or Hecuba,",
    "or someone unknown and nameless who nevertheless saw",
    "a Scamander overflow with corpses,",
    "isn\u2019t fated to hear",
    "messengers coming to tell him",
    "that so much suffering, so much life,",
    "went into the abyss",
    "all for an empty tunic, all for a Helen."

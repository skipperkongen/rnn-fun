    "The day was cloudy. No one could come to a decision;",
    "a light wind was blowing. \u2018Not a north-easter, the sirocco,\u2019 someone said.",
    "A few slender cypresses nailed to the slope, and, beyond, the sea",
    "grey with shining pools.",
    "The soldiers presented arms as it began to drizzle.",
    "\u2018Not a north-easter, the sirocco,\u2019 was the only decision heard.",
    "And yet we knew that by the following dawn",
    "nothing would be left to us, neither the woman drinking sleep at our side",
    "nor the memory that we were once men,",
    "nothing at all by the following dawn.",
    "\u2018This wind reminds me of spring,\u2019 said my friend",
    "as she walked beside me gazing into the distance, \u2018the spring",
    "that came suddenly in the winter by the closed-in sea.",
    "So unexpected. So many years have gone. How are we going to die?\u2019",
    "A funeral march meandered through the thin rain.",
    "How does a man die? Strange no one\u2019s thought about it.",
    "And for those who thought about it, it was like a recollection from old chronicles",
    "from the time of the Crusades or the battle of Salamis.",
    "Yet death is something that happens: how does a man die?",
    "Yet each of us earns his death, his own death, which belongs to no one else",
    "and this game is life.",
    "The light was fading from the clouded day, no one decided anything.",
    "The following dawn nothing would be left to us, everything surrendered, even our hands,",
    "and our women slaves at the springheads and our children in the quarries.",
    "My friend, walking beside me, was singing a disjointed song:",
    "\u2018In spring, in summer, slaves . . .\u2019",
    "One recalled old teachers who\u2019d left us orphans.",
    "A couple passed, talking:",
    "\u2018I\u2019m sick of the dusk, let\u2019s go home,",
    "let\u2019s go home and turn on the light.\u2019"

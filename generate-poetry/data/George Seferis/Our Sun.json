    "This sun was mine and yours; we shared it.",
    "Who\u2019s suffering behind the golden silk, who\u2019s dying?",
    "A woman beating her dry breasts cried out: \u2018Cowards,",
    "they\u2019ve taken my children and torn them to shreds, you\u2019ve killed them",
    "gazing at the fire-flies at dusk with a strange look,",
    "lost in blind thought.\u2019",
    "The blood was drying on a hand that a tree made green,",
    "a warrior was asleep clutching the lance that cast light against his side.",
    "It was ours, this sun, we saw nothing behind the gold embroidery",
    "then the messengers came, dirty and breathless,",
    "stuttering unintelligible words",
    "twenty days and nights on the barren earth with thorns only",
    "twenty days and nights feeling the bellies of the horses bleeding",
    "and not a moment\u2019s break to drink the rain-water.",
    "You told them to rest first and then to speak, the light had dazzled you.",
    "They died saying \u2018We don\u2019t have time\u2019, touching some rays of the sun.",
    "You\u2019d forgotten that no one rests.",
    "A woman howled \u2018Cowards\u2019, like a dog in the night.",
    "Once she would have been beautiful like you",
    "with wet mouth, veins alive beneath the skin,",
    "with love.",
    "This sun was ours; you kept all of it, you wouldn\u2019t follow me.",
    "And it was then I found out about those things behind the gold and the silk:",
    "we don\u2019t have time. The messengers were right."

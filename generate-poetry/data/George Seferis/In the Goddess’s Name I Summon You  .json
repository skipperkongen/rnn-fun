    "unknown to us",
    "poor and rich",
    "and statuettes offering",
    "small breasts with their fingers.",
    "Oil in the sun",
    "the leaves shuddered",

    "Oil on the shoulders",
    "and the flexing waist",
    "legs grass-dappled,",
    "and that wound in the sun",
    "as the bell rang for vespers",
    "as I spoke in the churchyard",
    "with a crippled man."

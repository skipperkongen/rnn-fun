    "They swing across the screen in brave array,",
    "Long British columns grinding the dark grass.",
    "Twelve months ago they marched into the grey",
    "Of battle; yet again behold them pass!",
    "One lifts his dusty cap; his hair is bright;",
    "I meet his eyes, eager and young and bold.",
    "The picture quivers into ghostly white;",
    "Then I remember, and my heart grows cold!"

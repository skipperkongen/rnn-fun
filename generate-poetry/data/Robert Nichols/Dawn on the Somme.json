    "Last night rain fell over the scarred plateau",
    "And now from the dark horizon, dazzling, flies",
    "Arrow on fire-plumed arrow to the skies",
    "Shot from the bright arc of Apollo's bow;",
    "And from the wild and writhen waste below,",
    "From flashing pools and mounds lit one by one,",
    "O is it mist or are these companies",
    "Of morning heroes who arise, arise",
    "With thrusting arms, with limbs and hair aglow",
    "Toward the risen god, upon whose brow",
    "Burns the gold laurel of all victories,",
    "Hero and hero's god, th' invincible Sun?"

    "Amazement fills my heart to-night,",
    "Amaze and awful fears;",
    "I am a ship that sees no light,",
    "But blindly onward steers.",
    "Flung toward heaven\u2019s toppling rage,",
    "Sunk between steep and steep,",
    "A lost and wondrous fight I wage",
    "With the embattled deep.",
    "I neither know nor care at length",
    "Where drives the storm about;",
    "Only I summon all my strength",
    "And swear to ride it out.",
    "Yet give I thanks; despite these wars.",
    "My ship\u2014though blindly blown,",
    "Long lost to sun or moon or stars\u2014",
    "Still stands up alone.",
    "I need no trust in borrowed spars;",
    "My strength is yet my own."

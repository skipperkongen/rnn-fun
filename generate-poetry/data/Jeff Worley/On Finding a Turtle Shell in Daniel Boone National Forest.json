    "This one got tired",
    "of lugging his fortress",
    "wherever he went,",
    "was done with duck and cover",
    "at every explosion",
    "through rustling leaves",
    "of fox and dog and skunk.",
    "Said",
    "to the ritual",
    "of pulling himself together. . .",
    "I imagine him waiting",
    "for the cover of darkness",
    "to let down his hinged drawbridge.",
    "He wanted, after so many",
    "protracted years of caution,",
    "to dance naked and nimble",
    "as a flame under the moon\u2014",
    "even if dancing just once",
    "was all that the teeth",
    "of the forest would allow."

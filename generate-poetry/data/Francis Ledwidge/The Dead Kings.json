    "All the dead kings came to me",
    "At Rosnaree, where I was dreaming,",
    "A few stars glimmered through the morn,",
    "And down the thorn the dews were streaming.",
    "And every dead king had a story",
    "Of ancient glory, sweetly told.",
    "It was too early for the lark,",
    "But the starry dark had tints of gold.",
    "I listened to the sorrows three",
    "Of that Eire passed into song.",
    "A cock crowed near a hazel croft,",
    "And up aloft dim larks winged strong.",
    "And I, too, told the kings a story",
    "Of later glory, her fourth sorrow:",
    "There was a sound like moving shields",
    "In high green fields and the lowland furrow.",
    "And one said: \u2018We who yet are kings",
    "Have heard these things lamenting inly.\u2019",
    "Sweet music flowed from many a bill",
    "And on the hill the morn stood queenly.",
    "And one said: \u2018Over is the singing,",
    "And bell bough ringing, whence we come;",
    "With heavy hearts we\u2019ll tread the shadows,",
    "In honey meadows birds are dumb.\u2019",
    "And one said: \u2018Since the poets perished",
    "And all they cherished in the way,",
    "Their thoughts unsung, like petal showers",
    "Inflame the hours of blue and grey.\u2019",
    "And one said: \u2018A loud tramp of men",
    "We\u2019ll hear again at Rosnaree.\u2019",
    "A bomb burst near me where I lay.",
    "I woke, \u2019twas day in Picardy."

    "The end of the affair is always death.",
    "She\u2019s my workshop. Slippery eye,",
    "out of the tribe of myself my breath",
    "finds you gone. I horrify",
    "those who stand by. I am fed.",
    "At night, alone, I marry the bed.",
    "Finger to finger, now she\u2019s mine.",
    "She\u2019s not too far. She\u2019s my encounter.",
    "I beat her like a bell. I recline",
    "in the bower where you used to mount her.",
    "You borrowed me on the flowered spread.",
    "At night, alone, I marry the bed.",
    "Take for instance this night, my love,",
    "that every single couple puts together",
    "with a joint overturning, beneath, above,",
    "the abundant two on sponge and feather,",
    "kneeling and pushing, head to head.",
    "At night alone, I marry the bed.",
    "I break out of my body this way,",
    "an annoying miracle. Could I",
    "put the dream market on display?",
    "I am spread out. I crucify.",
    "is what you said.",
    "At night, alone, I marry the bed.",
    "Then my black-eyed rival came.",
    "The lady of water, rising on the beach,",
    "a piano at her fingertips, shame",
    "on her lips and a flute\u2019s speech.",
    "And I was the knock-kneed broom instead.",
    "At night, alone, I marry the bed.",
    "She took you the way a woman takes",
    "a bargain dress off the rack",
    "and I broke the way a stone breaks.",
    "I give back your books and fishing tack.",
    "Today\u2019s paper says that you are wed.",
    "At night, alone, I marry the bed.",
    "The boys and girls are one tonight.",
    "They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies.",
    "They take off shoes. They turn off the light.",
    "The glimmering creatures are full of lies.",
    "They are eating each other. They are overfed.",
    "At night, alone, I marry the bed."

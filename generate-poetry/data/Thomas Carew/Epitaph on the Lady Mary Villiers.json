    "This little vault, this narrow room,",
    "Of Love, and Beauty, is the tomb;",
    "The dawning beam that gan to clear",
    "Our clouded sky, lies darken'd here,",
    "Forever set to us, by death",
    "Sent to inflame the world beneath.",
    "'Twas but a bud, yet did contain",
    "More sweetness than shall spring again;",
    "A budding star that might have grown",
    "Into a sun, when it had blown.",
    "This hopeful beauty did create",
    "New life in Love's declining state;",
    "But now his empire ends, and we",
    "From fire and wounding darts are free;",
    "His brand, his bow, let no man fear,",
    "The flames, the arrows, all lie here."

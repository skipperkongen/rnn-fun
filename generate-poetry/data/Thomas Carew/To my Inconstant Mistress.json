    "When thou, poor excommunicate",
    "From all the joys of love, shalt see",
    "The full reward and glorious fate",
    "Which my strong faith shall purchase me,",
    "Then curse thine own inconstancy.",
    "A fairer hand than thine shall cure",
    "That heart, which thy false oaths did wound;",
    "And to my soul, a soul more pure",
    "Than thine shall by Love's hand be bound,",
    "And both with equal glory crown'd.",
    "Then shalt thou weep, entreat, complain",
    "To Love, as I did once to thee;",
    "When all thy tears shall be as vain",
    "As mine were then, for thou shalt be",
    "Damn'd for thy false apostasy."

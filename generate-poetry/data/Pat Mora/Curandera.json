    "They think she lives alone",
    "on the edge of town in a two-room house",
    "where she moved when her husband died",
    "at thirty-five of a gunshot wound",
    "in the bed of another woman. The",
    "and house have aged together to the rhythm",
    "of the desert.",
    "She wakes early, lights candles before",
    "her sacred statues, brews tea of",
    "She moves down her porch steps, rubs",
    "cool morning sand into her hands, into her arms.",
    "Like a large black bird, she feeds on",
    "the desert, gathering herbs for her basket.",
    "Her days are slow, days of grinding",
    "dried snake into powder, of crushing",
    "wild bees to mix with white wine.",
    "And the townspeople come, hoping",
    "to be touched by her ointments,",
    "her hands, her prayers, her eyes.",
    "She listens to their stories, and she listens",
    "to the desert, always, to the desert.",
    "By sunset she is tired. The wind",
    "strokes the strands of long gray hair,",
    "the smell of drying plants drifts",
    "into her blood, the sun seeps",
    "into her bones. She dozes",
    "on her back porch. Rocking, rocking."

    "the day we met. Puddles, more or less, was what",
    "was left. But what could live wanted to and tried,",
    "treading narrow circles, a glide of brittle \ufb01ns.",
    "He wore those rubber boots, though the sun was",
    "an anvil, and very little wet; he smiled, I remember",
    "that, his nickel smile right at me, his \ufb01ngers",

    "it was he thought he was doing, but we talked,",
    "I listened as he taught me to relax the hand just enough.",

    "when we tense to catch. You have to believe it,",
    "he said. You don\u2019t mean any harm."

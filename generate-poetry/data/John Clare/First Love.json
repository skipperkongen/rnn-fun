    "I ne\u2019er was struck before that hour",
    "With love so sudden and so sweet,",
    "Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower",
    "And stole my heart away complete.",
    "My face turned pale as deadly pale,",
    "My legs refused to walk away,",
    "And when she looked, what could I ail?",
    "My life and all seemed turned to clay.",
    "And then my blood rushed to my face",
    "And took my eyesight quite away,",
    "The trees and bushes round the place",
    "Seemed midnight at noonday.",
    "I could not see a single thing,",
    "Words from my eyes did start\u2014",
    "They spoke as chords do from the string,",
    "And blood burnt round my heart.",
    "Are flowers the winter\u2019s choice?",
    "Is love\u2019s bed always snow?",
    "She seemed to hear my silent voice,",
    "Not love's appeals to know.",
    "I never saw so sweet a face",
    "As that I stood before.",
    "My heart has left its dwelling-place",
    "And can return no more."

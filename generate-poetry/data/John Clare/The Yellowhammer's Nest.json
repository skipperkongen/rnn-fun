    "Just by the wooden brig a bird flew up,",
    "Frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down",
    "To reach the misty dewberry\u2014let us stoop",
    "And seek its nest\u2014the brook we need not dread,",
    "'Tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown,",
    "So it sings harmless o'er its pebbly bed",
    "\u2014Ay here it is, stuck close beside the bank",
    "Beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank",
    "Its husk seeds tall and high\u2014'tis rudely planned",
    "Of bleach\u00e8d stubbles and the withered fare",
    "That last year's harvest left upon the land,",
    "Lined thinly with the horse's sable hair.",
    "Five eggs, pen-scribbled o'er with ink their shells",
    "Resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads",
    "As nature's poesy and pastoral spells\u2014",
    "They are the yellowhammer's and she dwells",
    "Most poet-like where brooks and flowery weeds",
    "As sweet as Castaly to fancy seems",
    "And that old molehill like as Parnass' hill",
    "On which her partner haply sits and dreams",
    "O'er all her joys of song\u2014so leave it still",
    "A happy home of sunshine, flowers and streams.",
    "Yet in the sweetest places cometh ill,",
    "A noisome weed that burthens every soil;",
    "For snakes are known with chill and deadly coil",
    "To watch such nests and seize the helpless young,",
    "And like as though the plague became a guest,",
    "Leaving a houseless home, a ruined nest\u2014",
    "And mournful hath the little warblers sung",
    "When such like woes hath rent its little breast."

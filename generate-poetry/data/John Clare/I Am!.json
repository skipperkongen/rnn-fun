    "I am\u2014yet what I am none cares or knows;",
    "My friends forsake me like a memory lost:",
    "I am the self-consumer of my woes\u2014",
    "They rise and vanish in oblivious host,",
    "Like shadows in love\u2019s frenzied stifled throes",
    "And yet I am, and live\u2014like vapours tossed",
    "Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,",
    "Into the living sea of waking dreams,",
    "Where there is neither sense of life or joys,",
    "But the vast shipwreck of my life\u2019s esteems;",
    "Even the dearest that I loved the best",
    "Are strange\u2014nay, rather, stranger than the rest.",
    "I long for scenes where man hath never trod",
    "A place where woman never smiled or wept",
    "There to abide with my Creator, God,",
    "And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept,",
    "Untroubling and untroubled where I lie",
    "The grass below\u2014above the vaulted sky."

    "'Tis happiness of healthy dreams",
    "Eve\u2019s dews may weep,",
    "But love delightful seems.",
    "'Tis seen in flowers,",
    "And in the even's pearly dew",
    "On earth's green hours,",
    "And in the heaven's eternal blue.",
    "\u2018Tis heard in spring",
    "When light and sunbeams, warm and kind,",
    "On angels\u2019 wing",
    "Bring love and music to the wind.",
    "And where is voice,",
    "So young, so beautiful and sweet",
    "As nature\u2019s choice,",

    "Love lives beyond",
    "The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew.",
    "I love the fond,",
    "The faithful, young and true."

    "I don\u2019t know what to say to you, neighbor,",
    "as you shovel snow from your part of our street",
    "neat in your Greek black. I\u2019ve waited for",
    "chance to find words; now, by chance, we meet.",
    "We took our boys to the same kindergarten,",
    "thirteen years ago when our husbands went.",
    "Both boys hated school, dropped out feral, dropped in",
    "to separate troubles. You shift snow fast, back bent,",
    "but your boy killed himself, six days dead.",
    "My boy washed your wall when the police were done.",
    "He says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t friends?\u201d and shakes his head,",
    "\u201cI told him it was great he had that gun,\u201d",
    "and shakes. I shake, close to you, close to you.",
    "You have a path to clear, and so you do."

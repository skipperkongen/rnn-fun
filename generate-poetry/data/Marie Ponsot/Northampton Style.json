    "Evening falls. Someone\u2019s playing a dulcimer",
    "Northampton-style, on the porch out back.",
    "Its voice touches and parts the air of summer,",
    "as if it swam to time us down a river",
    "where we dive and leave a single track",
    "as evening falls. Someone\u2019s playing a dulcimer",
    "that lets us wash our mix of dreams together.",
    "Delicate, tacit, we engage in our act;",
    "its voice touches and parts the air of summer.",
    "When we disentangle you are not with her",
    "I am not with him. Redress calls for tact.",
    "Evening falls. Someone\u2019s playing a dulcimer",
    "still. A small breeze rises and the leaves stir",
    "as uneasy as we, while the woods go black;",
    "its voice touches and parts the air of summer",
    "and lets darkness enter us; our strings go slack",
    "though the player keeps up his plangent attack.",
    "Evening falls. Someone\u2019s playing a dulcimer;",
    "its voice touches and parts the air of summer."

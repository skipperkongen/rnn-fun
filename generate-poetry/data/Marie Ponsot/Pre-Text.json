    "Archaic, his gestures",

    "or Mary\u2019s Jesus or Ann\u2019s Mary or Jane",
    "Austen once, or me or your mother\u2019s you",
    "the sudden baby surges to his feet",
    "and sways, head forward, chin high,",
    "arms akimbo, hands dangling idle,",
    "elbows up, as if winged.",
    "The features of his face stand out",
    "amazed, all eyes as his aped posture",

    "slept in egg inside",
    "grandma\u2019s unborn daughter\u2019s",
    "folded ovaries."

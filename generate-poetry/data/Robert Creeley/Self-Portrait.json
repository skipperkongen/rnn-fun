    "He wants to be",
    "a brutal old man,",
    "an aggressive old man,",
    "as dull, as brutal",
    "as the emptiness around him,",
    "He doesn\u2019t want compromise,",
    "nor to be ever nice",
    "to anyone. Just mean,",
    "and final in his brutal,",
    "his total, rejection of it all.",
    "He tried the sweet,",
    "the gentle, the \u201coh,",
    "let\u2019s hold hands together\u201d",
    "and it was awful,",
    "dull, brutally inconsequential.",
    "Now he\u2019ll stand on",
    "his own dwindling legs.",
    "His arms, his skin,",
    "shrink daily. And",
    "he loves, but hates equally."

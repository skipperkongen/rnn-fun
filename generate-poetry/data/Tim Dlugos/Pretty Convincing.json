    "I\u2019ve been worried about how I metabolize",
    "the sauce for four years, since my second bout",
    "of hepatitis, when I kissed all the girls",
    "at Christmas dinner and turned bright yellow",
    "Christmas night, but never about whether",
    "I could handle it. It\u2019s been more of a given,",
    "the stage set for my life as an artistic queer,",
    "as much of a tradition in these New York circles",
    "as incense for Catholics or German",
    "shepherds for the blind. We re-enact",
    "the rituals, and our faces, like smoky icons",
    "in a certain light, seem to learn nothing",
    "but understand all. It comforts me",
    "yet isn\u2019t all that pleasant, like drinking",
    "Ripple to remember high school. A friend",
    "of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades,",
    "talking to the same types, but progressively",
    "fewer blonds. Joe LeSueur says he\u2019s glad",
    "to have been a young man in the Fifties with his",
    "Tab Hunter good looks, because that was the image",
    "men desired; now it\u2019s the Puerto Rican",
    "angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity",
    "that springs out of machismo, rather than a moral",
    "choice. His argument is pretty convincing, too,",

    "and led him by the hand to the dowager\u2014Woman, behold",
    "thy son\u2014underneath a darkening conviction that all,",
    "if not wrong, was not right. By now Henry may have faced",
    "the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky.",
    "Stay as outrageously nasty as you were. And Patrick",
    "Mack, locked into memory as he held court in the Anvil",
    "by the downstairs pinball machine, and writhing",

    "heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods,",
    "flickering on at twilight as I used to do",
    "in the years when I crashed more parties and acted",
    "more outrageously and met more beauties and made",
    "more enemies than ever before or ever again, I pray.",
    "It\u2019s spring and there\u2019s another crop of kids",

    "of prettiness, convincing to themselves and the devout.",
    "We who are about to catch the eye of someone",
    "new salute as the cotillion passes, led by blonds",
    "and followed by the rest of us, a formal march",
    "to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out",
    "onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia",
    "that hides the trash sprout magically",
    "at our approach. I toast it",
    "as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent",
    "as a blond in love. My clothes smell like the smoky",
    "bar, but the sweetness of the April air\u2019s",
    "delicious when I step outside and fill",
    "my lungs, leaning my head back",
    "in a first-class seat on the shuttle",
    "between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds",
    "to come and an enormous Irish wake in which",
    "the corpses change but the party goes on forever."

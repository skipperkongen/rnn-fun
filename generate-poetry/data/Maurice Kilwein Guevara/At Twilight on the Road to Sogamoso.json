    "The sun is beginning to go down",
    "over a field of yellow onions. The edges",
    "of the clouds are almost pink, and at this hour",
    "the maguey rises up like a flower of dark blades.",
    "I worked so long today I have forgotten",
    "my own hunger. It takes a full minute",
    "for me to remember a word I have used",
    "all my life. What the Mexicans call",
    "At twilight I see it, abandoned, hanging like a ghost",
    "on the limb of a tree: my own brown",
    "next to gray speckled chickens pecking at roots",
    "and a black track of storm coming west over the green mountain."

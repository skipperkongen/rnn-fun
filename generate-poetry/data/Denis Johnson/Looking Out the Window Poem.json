    "The sounds of traffic",

    "the neighborhood cannot",

    "it is only",
    "to be in all this",
    "making all possible.",
    "I am glad to be",
    "finally a part",
    "of such machinery. I was",
    "after all not so fond",
    "of living, and there comes",
    "into me, when I see",
    "how little I liked",
    "being a man, a great joy.",
    "Look out our astounding",
    "clear windows before evening.",
    "It is almost as if",
    "the world were blue",
    "with some lubricant,",
    "it shines so."

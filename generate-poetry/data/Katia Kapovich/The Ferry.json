    "I\u2019m jotting down these lines,",

    "where there\u2019s always a line to the loo",
    "and no one knows where the captain is.",
    "Slightly seasick, I keep on writing",
    "of the wind-rose and lobster traps,",

    "training binoculars on a tugboat.",
    "When I finish this letter, I\u2019ll take a gulp",
    "from the flask you gave me for the road",
    "in days when I was too young to care about",
    "those on the pier who waved goodbye.",
    "I miss them now: cousins in linen dresses,",
    "my mother, you, boys in light summer shirts.",
    "Life is too long. The compass needle dances.",
    "Everything passes by. The ferry passes",
    "by ragged yellow shores."

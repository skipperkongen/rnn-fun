    "I grew up in a village built on coal and labor.",
    "An outhouse on a dirt road by a water pump",

    "that gaped like broken teeth in the mouths of miners.",
    "All summer we played Cossacks and Bandits,",
    "shot our symbolic rifles and revolvers",
    "and when killed would crush a wild cherry",
    "in the breast pocket, the spot where the heart stopped.",
    "Who started it? The red spreading over white satin",
    "never to be washed away completely,",
    "\u201cI killed you! I killed you!\u201d I screamed",
    "as he fell down. Men found him three years later",
    "in the abandoned mine after an explosion,",
    "his clothes covered with coal dust and blood.",
    "Women howled like wolves. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,",
    "he\u2019ll get up,\u201d I thought, \u201cit\u2019s just that stupid",

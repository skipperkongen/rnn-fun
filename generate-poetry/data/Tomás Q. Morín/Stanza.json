    "Because in medieval Italian it meant \u201croom\u201d",
    "I tied the curtains at their elbows with",
    "what could have been honor cords or worse",
    "yet, a belt from the 60s, so hideous were the",
    "tassels that were dancing a little tarantella",
    "after I had propped the windows and the wind",
    "had carried in the song the rubbing trees",
    "were making, without any accompaniment,",
    "mind you, from a tambourine, although the bells",
    "of the occasional sleigh played that part,",
    "while I waited for the vixen and their shameless",
    "yelping to follow the music and the cold",
    "and the night inside where I sat half man,",
    "half snow, to investigate my squeaking",
    "pencil and the flapping of the bird-white page",
    "I couldn\u2019t seem to catch in those years when I",
    "lugged around a frozen heart and was infatuated",
    "with whiteness, since I had read somewhere it was",
    "the absence of color, which could not be true",
    "since I had once loved a pure white duck with",
    "a white bill and feet and I had even torn its white",
    "flesh with my teeth that were still then white,",
    "which should have been all the proof anyone needed",
    "to debunk our outdated theories of absence."

    "Curtains drawn back, the door ajar.",
    "All winter long, it seemed, a darkening",
    "Began. But now the moonlight and the odors of the street",
    "Conspire and combine toward one community.",
    "These are the rooms of Robinson.",
    "Bleached, wan, and colorless this light, as though",
    "All the blurred daybreaks of the spring",
    "Found an asylum here, perhaps for Robinson alone,",
    "Who sleeps. Were there more music sifted through the floors",
    "And moonlight of a different kind,",
    "He might awake to hear the news at ten,",
    "Which will be shocking, moderately.",
    "This sleep is from exhaustion, but his old desire",
    "To die like this has known a lessening.",
    "Now there is only this coldness that he has to wear.",
    "But not in sleep.\u2014Observant scholar, traveller,",
    "Or uncouth bearded figure squatting in a cave,",
    "A keen-eyed sniper on the barricades,",
    "A heretic in catacombs, a famed rou\u00e9,",
    "A beggar on the streets, the confidant of Popes\u2014",
    "All these are Robinson in sleep, who mumbles as he turns,",
    "\u201cThere is something in this madhouse that I symbolize\u2014",
    "This city\u2014nightmare\u2014black\u2014\u201d",
    "He wakes in sweat",
    "To the terrible moonlight and what might be",
    "Silence. It drones like wires far beyond the roofs,",
    "And the long curtains blow into the room."

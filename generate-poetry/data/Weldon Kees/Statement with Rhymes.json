    "Plurality is all. I walk among the restaurants,",
    "the theatres, the grocery stores; I ride the cars",
    "and hear of Mrs. Bedford\u2019s teeth and Albuquerque,",
    "strikes unsettled, someone\u2019s simply marvelous date,",
    "news of the German Jews, the baseball scores,",
    "storetalk and whoretalk, talk of wars. I turn",
    "the pages of a thousand books to read",
    "the names of Buddha, Malthus, Walker Evans, Stendhal, Andr\u00e9 Gide,",
    "Ouspenski; note the terms: obscurantism,",
    "factorize, fagaceous, endocarp; descend",
    "the nervous stairs to hear the broken ends",
    "of songs that float through city air.",
    "In Osnabr\u00fcck and Ogden, on the Passamaquoddy Bay,",
    "in Ahmednagar, Waco (Neb.), in Santa F\u00e9,",
    "propelled by zeros, zinc, and zephyrs, always I\u2019m pursued",
    "by thoughts of what I am, authority, remembrance, food,",
    "the letter on the mezzanine, the unemployed, dogs\u2019 lonely faces, pianos and decay.",
    "Plurality is all. I sympathize, but cannot grieve",
    "too long for those who wear their dialectics on their sleeves.",
    "The pattern\u2019s one I sometimes rather like; there\u2019s really nothing wrong",
    "with it for some. But I should add: It doesn\u2019t wear for long,",
    "before I push the elevator bell and quickly leave."

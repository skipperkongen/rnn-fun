    "Your mother called it",
    "and you know now",
    "how right she was.",
    "There is something urgent here.",
    "Not even the hiss",
    "under each button",
    "or the yellow business",
    "ground in at the neck",
    "can make one instant",
    "of this work seem unimportant.",
    "You've been taught",
    "to turn the pocket corners",
    "and pick out the dark lint",
    "that collects there.",
    "You're tempted to leave it,",
    "but the old lessons",
    "go deeper than habits.",
    "Everyone else is asleep.",
    "The odor of sweat rises",
    "when you do",
    "under the armpits,",
    "the owner's particular smell",
    "you can never quite wash out.",
    "You'll stay up.",
    "You'll have your way,",
    "the final stroke",
    "and sharpness",
    "down the long sleeves,",
    "a truly permanent edge."

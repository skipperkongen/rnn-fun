    "The way calcium grows",
    "all by itself into bone, microscopic",
    "fraction attaches itself to fraction",
    "or clouds crystallize, or blizzards congeal into hard",
    "ice on aluminum wings,",
    "even the astronauts\u2019 bodysuits can\u2019t cover up",
    "the sheer strangeness of it, the extraordinary being-here",
    "or anywhere, the skin of the plane could easily peel back",
    "like an ear of corn and then what\u2019s to be seen but",
    "the live, disintegrating,",
    "terrified Barbie Doll asks, stuffed into her jeans",
    "like a stick of butter, her neat, pointed feet dangerously",
    "stuck into sky...",
    "but still, teetering down the aisle",
    "if anyone bumps her she glares,",
    "this little packet of a hundred and twenty-two",
    "pounds more or less says",
    "one minute the cold kitchen, next minute Miami Beach,",
    "digging into the sand beside the violent-",
    "ly green sea, droplets of Almighty coconut oil",
    "under the crisp tang of salt drizzle and lick",
    "all over its bare, lusciously bronzed congregation",
    "of too too solid\u2014",
    "No! Never in this world, the greedy molecules hiss",
    "as the plane turns inland, the woman returns to her seat",
    "past all the other anonymous collections of cells,",
    "some snoring, some fussing with their kids,",
    "one bent over a laptop, another staring",
    "straight at her for a second, with X-ray",
    "exhausted eyes peering, then swiveling away",
    "as if they\u2019d known each other before, fellow crew members",
    "from another planet,",
    "though the woman thinks of herself only on Main Street\u2014my",
    "my what an arrangement of chromosomes collected",
    "who knows why\u2014up here among streaked, boiling clouds",
    "with the plane speeding through them, how",
    "it is, how far the body travels",
    "from its babyhood, locked in its charged circuits",
    "she thinks about edges, the leathery sunburned skin",
    "flaking off, in filmy shreds,",
    "sound barriers breaking away from her but here she still is",
    "for this one second fixed, eyes sticking out of the top of her face",
    "like the glint of a buried pin or the beak",
    "of a mother robin in the nest",
    "she made for herself:",
    "with earth losing its outer walls",
    "twig by twig, what is this naked fork quivering",
    "in the middle of Whose consciousness",
    "she keeps wondering, whizzing across the face",
    "of an electric cloud chamber,",
    "here all I am",
    "is falling, in the tight ship of the diminished,",
    "in hot chips of pure",
    "ignorant energy fizzing around some magnet,",
    "some lucky iron only",
    "imagination can count on,",
    "trembling, gritting her teeth on the thread",
    "of an end she can\u2019t know,",
    "in arms I can love always",
    "she whispers to herself,",
    "..."

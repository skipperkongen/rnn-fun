    "It\u2019s always been a wish of mine",
    "(Or should I say a dream)",
    "To scare my sister half to death",
    "And hear her piercing scream.",
    "That\u2019s why I squished four bugs until",
    "They all were very dead,",
    "Then took them to my sister\u2019s room",
    "And put them in her bed.",
    "After we had said goodnight,",
    "My heart began to pound.",
    "I waited and I waited, but",
    "She never made a sound.",
    "And then I got so doggone tired",
    "I couldn\u2019t stay awake.",
    "I climbed into my own warm bed",
    "And shrieked\u2014there was a snake!",
    "It wiggled, and I leaped and fell",
    "And bruised my bottom half;",
    "Then I heard an awful sound\u2014",
    "It was my sister\u2019s laugh."

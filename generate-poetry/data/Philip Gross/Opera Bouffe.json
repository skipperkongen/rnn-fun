    "The count of cappuccino,",
    "the marquise of meringue,",
    "all the little cantuccini...",
    "and what was the song they sang?",
    "Oh, the best of us is nothing",
    "but a sweetening of the air,",
    "a tryst between the teeth and tongue:",
    "we meet and no one\u2019s there",
    "though the caf\u00e9\u2019s always crowded",
    "as society arrives",
    "and light glints to and fro between",
    "the eyes and rings and knives.",
    "We\u2019ll slip away together,",
    "perfect ghosts of appetite,",
    "the balancing of ash on fire",
    "and whim\u2014the mating flight",
    "of amaretti papers,",
    "my",
    ",",
    "our lit cage rising weightless",
    "up the lift shaft of the air.",
    "So the count of cappuccino,",
    "the marquise of not much more,",
    "consumed each other\u2019s hunger.",
    "Then the crash. And then the war."

    "Brave comrade, answer! When you joined the war,",
    "What left you? \u201cWife and children, wealth and friends,",
    "A storied home whose ancient roof-tree bends",
    "Above such thoughts as love tells o\u2019er and o\u2019er.\u201d",
    "Had you no pang or struggle? \u201cYes; I bore",
    "Such pain on parting as at hell\u2019s gate rends",
    "The entering soul, when from its grasp ascends",
    "The last faint virtue which on earth it wore.\u201d",
    "You loved your home, your kindred, children, wife;",
    "You loathed yet plunged into war\u2019s bloody whirl!\u2014",
    "What urged you? \u201cDuty! Something more than life.",
    "That which made Abraham bare the priestly knife,",
    "And Isaac kneel, or that young Hebrew girl",
    "Who sought her father coming from the strife.\u201d"

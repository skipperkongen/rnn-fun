    "someone said",
    "when you appeared onstage\u2014thirty years",
    "in those white robes, spotlights tracking",
    "your graceful sleeves, the attentive angle",
    "of your head as you worked a crowd. I agreed",
    "that you looked tired, but when Mary Magdalene",
    "anointed you, when you cast merchants",
    "and money changers from the temple, I forgot",
    "your thinning hair and wrinkled brow, forgot",
    "how your story ended: your broken voice",
    "crying on the cross, your body arched as you",
    "ascended. I\u2019d lost track of how many songs",
    "were in the second act, thought there might",
    "be more\u2014the empty tomb, your appearance",
    "on the road, to Peter in Jerusalem\u2014but the cast",
    "came out for applause: soldiers, Apostles,",
    "and women; Annas, Caiaphas, Pilate; Mary",
    "in her red dress; Peter, that sturdy fisherman;",
    "Judas, who has all the best songs; and finally",
    "you, head bowed at our ovation. I didn\u2019t come",
    "to worship but you\u2019ve left me no choice\u2014",
    "I don\u2019t care how old you are, how many times",
    "you\u2019ve done this act before\u2014you still rock",
    "those power ballads, still heal with the same",
    "sweet force before you rise. We\u2019ll always want",
    "too much from you. Tonight, I\u2019ll believe until",
    "the curtain closes, your tour bus rolls away."

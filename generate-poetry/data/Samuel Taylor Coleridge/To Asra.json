    "Are there two things, of all which men possess,",
    "That are so like each other and so near,",
    "As mutual Love seems like to Happiness?",
    "Dear Asra, woman beyond utterance dear!",
    "This love which ever welling at my heart,",
    "Now in its living fount doth heave and fall,",
    "Now overflowing pours thro\u2019 every part",
    "Of all my frame, and fills and changes all,",
    "Like vernal waters springing up through snow,",
    "This Love that seeming great beyond the power",
    "Of growth, yet seemeth ever more to grow,",
    "Could I transmute the whole to one rich Dower",
    "Of Happy Life, and give it all to Thee,",
    "Thy lot, methinks, were Heaven, thy age, Eternity!"

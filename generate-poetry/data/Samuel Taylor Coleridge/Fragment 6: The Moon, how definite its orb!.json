    "The Moon, how definite its orb!",
    "Yet gaze again, and with a steady gaze\u0097",
    "'Tis there indeed,\u0097but where is it not?\u0097",
    "It is suffused o'er all the sapphire Heaven,",
    "Trees, herbage, snake-like stream, unwrinkled Lake,",
    "Whose very murmur does of it partake",
    "And low and close the broad smooth mountain",
    "Is more a thing of Heaven than when",
    "Distinct by one dim shade and yet undivided from the universal cloud",
    "In which it towers, finite in height."

    "If I had but two little wings",
    "And were a little feathery bird,",
    "To you I'd fly, my dear!",
    "But thoughts like these are idle things,",
    "And I stay here.",
    "But in my sleep to you I fly:",
    "I'm always with you in my sleep!",
    "The world is all one's own.",
    "But then one wakes, and where am I?",
    "All, all alone.",
    "Sleep stays not, though a monarch bids:",
    "So I love to wake ere break of day:",
    "For though my sleep be gone,",
    "Yet while 'tis dark, one shuts one's lids,",
    "And still dreams on."

    "The piano has crawled into the quarry. Hauled",
    "In last night for firewood, sprawled",
    "With frozen barrels, crates and sticks,",
    "The piano is waiting for the axe.",
    "Legless, a black box, still polished;",
    "It lies on its belly like a lizard,",
    "Droning, heaving, hardly fashioned",
    "For the quarry\u2019s primordial art.",
    "Blood red: his frozen fingers cleft,",
    "Two on the right hand, five on the left,",
    "He goes down on his knees to reach the keyboard,",
    "To strike the lizard\u2019s chord.",
    "Seven fingers pick out rhymes and rhythm,",
    "The frozen skin, steaming, peels off them,",
    "As from a boiled potato. Their schemes,",
    "Their beauty, ivory and anthracite,",
    "Flicker and flash like the great Northern Lights.",
    "Everything played before is a great lie.",
    "The reflections of flaming chandeliers\u2014",
    "Deceit, the white columns, the grand tiers",
    "In warm concert halls\u2014wild lies.",
    "But the steel of the piano howls in me,",
    "I lie in the quarry and I am deft",
    "As the lizard. I accept the gift.",
    "I\u2019ll be a song for Russia, I\u2019ll be",
    "an \u00e9tude, warmth and bread for everybody."

    "I see it as it looked one afternoon",
    "In August,\u2014 by a fresh soft breeze o\u2019erblown.",
    "The swiftness of the tide, the light thereon,",
    "A far-off sail, white as a crescent moon.",
    "The shining waters with pale currents strewn,",
    "The quiet fishing-smacks, the Eastern cove,",
    "The semi-circle of its dark, green grove.",
    "The luminous grasses, and the merry sun",
    "In the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide,",
    "Laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirp",
    "Of crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide,",
    "Light summer clouds fantastical as sleep",
    "Changing unnoted while I gazed thereon.",
    "All these fair sounds and sights I made my own."

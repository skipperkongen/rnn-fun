    "A partial truth. I am unique,",

    "Of desire buffets me no less",
    "Than it has other sons of man",
    "Who\u2019ve come and gone since time began.",
    "The meaning, then, of this dispute?",
    "My life\u2019s a nominal/real pursuit,",
    "Which leaves identity clear and blurred,",
    "In which what happens has occurred",
    "Often and never\u2014which is to say,",
    "Never to me, or quite this way."

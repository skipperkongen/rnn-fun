    "In the field is a house",
    "of wood. A window of the house",
    "contains the field.",
    "You can't see far",
    "with a sun in the sky,",
    "with a living-room lamp",
    "at night. Locality is all",
    "you light, and you, as single",
    "as a bed. But there's",
    "no end to dark. The bed is in the clearing",
    "and the clearing's in the wind; the world",
    "is a world among others. Now your cell-stars split."

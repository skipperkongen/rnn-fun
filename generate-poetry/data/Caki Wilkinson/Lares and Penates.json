    "The suburbs? Well, for heaven\u2019s sake",
    "who wouldn\u2019t choose the absolute",
    "convenience? Cheap, a quick commute,",
    "and close to Lowe\u2019s, a Steak \u2019n Shake,",
    "our own police and DMV,",
    "a library, a lake.",
    "Esteemed domestic diplomats,",
    "we trump conundrums (His and Hers)",
    "and smother any fuss that stirs",
    "the air of habit habitats.",
    "It\u2019s not an easy job; in short,",
    "we wear a lot of hats.",
    "And so, we\u2019re grateful, from the street",
    "you\u2019d miss the issues we\u2019re ignoring:",
    "termites and week-old dishes mooring,",
    "barnacled with shredded wheat,",
    "the bunch of brown bananas stuck",
    "with a yellow Post-it:",
    "We dictate chores, but understand",
    "the clock moves faster than we do",
    "and focus on those old and blue",
    "dilemmas of the second hand:",
    "inheritance, ill-fitting pants,",
    "smoke, rumors, foreclosed land.",
    "Winters, we help keep track of taxes,",
    "sort copies Xerox-hot in piles,",
    "or prune unruly hanging files",
    "(a fixture of our weekend praxis).",
    "There\u2019s always something. In this house,",
    "only the cat relaxes\u2014",
    "because the clutter drives a need",
    "for more, more room, more hours, food,",
    "more use of the subjunctive mood . . .",
    "tomorrow, yes, we must succeed",
    "in keeping peace and making time",
    "to garden, and to read.",
    "Still, every spring our porches spawn",
    "insects we can\u2019t identify",
    "and ferns turned freeze-dried octopi.",
    "They spill into the arid lawn",
    "with diasporic fliers, clover",
    "and choirs of woebegone",
    "house sparrows whose incessant cheeping",
    "recalls the gloomy",
    ",",
    "our soundtrack to the nightly hunt",
    "for whatever is downstairs, beeping.",
    "(As if the sleepless wanted some",
    "reminder they\u2019re not sleeping.)",
    "But don\u2019t fret; clarity, if brief,",
    "is possible. The best folks see",
    "an artfulness in entropy\u2014",
    "the rust, the dust, the bas-relief",
    "of Aquafresh-encrusted sinks.",
    "So when, in disbelief,",
    "a lady skims new catalogs,",
    "convinced her luster\u2019s fading, faded,",
    "and, afraid to end up jaded,",
    "doughy in orthotic clogs,",
    "she gracefully accepts her fate",
    "and rises early. Jogs."

    "My mare, when she was in heat,",
    "would travel the fenceline for hours,",
    "wearing the impatience",
    "in her feet into the ground.",
    "Not a stallion for miles, I\u2019d assure her,",
    "give it up.",
    "She\u2019d widen her nostrils,",
    "sieve the wind for news, be moving again,",
    "her underbelly darkening with sweat,",
    "then stop at the gate a moment, wait",
    "to see what I might do.",
    "Oh, I knew",
    "how it was for her, easily",
    "recognized myself in that wide lust:",
    "came to stand in the pasture",
    "just to see it played.",
    "Offered a hand, a bucket of grain\u2014",
    "a minute\u2019s distraction from passion",
    "the most I gave.",
    "Then she\u2019d return to what burned her:",
    "the fence, the fence,",
    "so hoping I might see, might let her free.",
    "I\u2019d envy her then,",
    "to be so restlessly sure",
    "of heat, and need, and what it takes",
    "to feed the wanting that we are\u2014",
    "only a gap to open",
    "the width of a mare,",
    "the rest would take care of itself.",
    "Surely, surely I knew that,",
    "who had the power of bucket",
    "and bridle\u2014",
    "she would beseech me, sidle up,",
    "be gone, as life is short.",
    "But desire, desire is long."

    "A man reaches close",

    "she didn\u2019t know was there.",

    "you may wonder:",
    "the quarter\u2019s serrated murmur",
    "against the thumb",
    "or the dove\u2019s knuckled silence?",
    "That he found them,",
    "or that she never had,",
    "or that in Portugal,",
    "this same half-stopped moment,",
    "it\u2019s almost dawn,",
    "and a woman in a wheelchair",
    "is singing a fado",
    "that puts every life in the room",
    "on one pan of a scale,",
    "itself on the other,",
    "and the copper bowls balance."

    "Like the small hole by the path-side something lives in,",
    "in me are lives I do not know the names of,",
    "nor the fates of,",
    "nor the hungers of or what they eat.",
    "They eat of me.",
    "Of small and blemished apples in low fields of me",
    "whose rocky streams and droughts I do not drink.",
    "And in my streets\u2014the narrow ones,",
    "unlabeled on the self-map\u2014",
    "they follow stairs down music ears can\u2019t follow,",
    "and in my tongue borrowed by darkness,",
    "in hours uncounted by the self-clock,",
    "they speak in restless syllables of other losses, other loves.",
    "There too have been the hard extinctions,",
    "missing birds once feasted on and feasting.",
    "There too must be machines",
    "like loud ideas with tungsten bits that grind the day.",
    "A few escape. A mercy.",
    "They leave behind",
    "small holes that something unweighed by the self-scale lives in."

    "What crowding thoughts around me wake,",
    "What marvels in a Christmas-cake!",
    "Ah say, what strange enchantment dwells",
    "Enclosed within its odorous cells?",
    "Is there no small magician bound",
    "Encrusted in its snowy round?",
    "For magic surely lurks in this,",
    "A cake that tells of vanished bliss;",
    "A cake that conjures up to view",
    "The early scenes, when life was new;",
    "When memory knew no sorrows past,",
    "And hope believed in joys that last! \u2014",
    "Mysterious cake, whose folds contain",
    "Life\u2019s calendar of bliss and pain;",
    "That speaks of friends for ever fled,",
    "And wakes the tears I love to shed.",
    "Oft shall I breathe her cherished name",
    "From whose fair hand the offering came:",
    "For she recalls the artless smile",
    "Of nymphs that deck my native isle;",
    "Of beauty that we love to trace,",
    "Allied with tender, modest grace;",
    "Of those who, while abroad they roam,",
    "Retain each charm that gladdens home,",
    "And whose dear friendships can impart",
    "A Christmas banquet for the heart!"

    "One of the spectators is disappointed",
    "there isn\u2019t a guide to explain",
    "the beaching, the scientists busy",
    "cutting into ninety-four pilot whales",
    "stranded on the salt grass.",
    "No one knows why and, try as the rescue team",
    "might, not one whale will go back to water.",
    "So they\u2019re injected to speed up the dying,",
    "lined up like lumber and sawed into,",
    "except when the black skin splits",
    "we can\u2019t stop staring, their meat is so red.",
    "I don\u2019t want to know why this happens\u2014",
    "what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly",
    "finished their love of motion. Why should",
    "anything have to leave this world",
    "when water can cycle from atmosphere",
    "down to land, the ocean and back",
    "to forgiving sky.",
    "I\u2019m on my way to Connecticut",
    "where my father has a little",
    "on his heart valve\u2014that\u2019s how the intern",
    "describes it, trying to minimize",
    "the danger of him slipping",
    "into a haze so cold, some nights,",
    "bone-cold, his hand can\u2019t get from",
    "his plate to his mouth.",
    "Rain slicks the highway",
    "slowing me down. The same water",
    "fattened into snow in the woods",
    "of my childhood, the whiteness",
    "unbroken except where my father",
    "cut trails and taught me to ski,",
    "laying down the herringbone behind him",
    "as he broke up hills that left me",
    "with legs made of slush. He wanted me strong,",
    "no patience for pain. No choice",
    "but to find the muscle to follow. Even now",
    "when he boasts how I zigzagged",
    "the breakneck hills in an icestorm,",
    "there\u2019s no hint of my knee-chattering fear,",
    "slats skittering out of control,",
    "each run a victory of luck more than will,",
    "each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.",
    "I wonder how it is for him now",
    "there in the ward where whiteness can\u2019t hide",
    "the cold blank that\u2019s ahead. When the whales",
    "beached, spectators came like pilgrims,",
    "each new arrival scanning the faces",
    "of those heading back to their cars",
    "to see how it changed them",
    "to survey so much death. Nothing showed.",
    "Their eyes followed the asphalt,",
    "heads bent in private devotion.",
    "There in a room",
    "where others have died, my father",
    "keeps a record of each test and drug.",
    "He watches medicine drip into his arm",
    "and circle in the dark of his blood.",
    "I believe it will heal him, as I believe",
    "in the strength of my blood",
    "to protect me from failures of will. Once",
    "when my grandmother at ninety-six",
    "lay delirious with pneumonia,",
    "pitching on her high horsehair bed,",
    "she saw three crows perched on the dresser.",
    "she said.",
    "It was my father who did what she asked.",
    "And the crows flew out, carrying her fever",
    "over the treeline, dissolving into sky,",
    "and she lived. Whatever she saw,",
    "by love, luck or dumb Yankee will,",
    "it was true. That\u2019s what I mean by medicine."

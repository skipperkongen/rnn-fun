    "But prayer was not enough, after all, for my father.",
    "His last two brothers died five weeks apart.",
    "He couldn\u2019t get to sleep, had no appetite, sat",
    "staring. Though he prayed,",
    "he could find no peace until he tried",
    "to write about his brothers, tell a story",
    "for each one: Perry\u2019s long travail",
    "with the steamfitters\u2019 union, which he worked for;",
    "and Harvey\u2014here the handwriting changes,",
    "he bears down\u2014Harvey loved his children.",
    "I discovered those few sheets of paper",
    "as I looked through my father\u2019s old Bible",
    "on the morning of his funeral. The others",
    "in the family had seen them long ago;",
    "they had all known the story,",
    "and they told me I had not, most probably, because",
    "I am a writer,",
    "and my father was embarrassed by his effort. Yet",
    "who has seen him as I can: risen",
    "in the middle of the night, bending over",
    "the paper, working close",
    "to the heart of all greatness, he is so lost."

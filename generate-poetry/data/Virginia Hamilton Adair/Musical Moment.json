    "Always the caravan of sound made us halt",
    "to admire the swinging and the swift go-by",
    "of beasts with enormous hooves and heads",
    "beating the earth or reared against the sky.",
    "Do not reread, I mean glance ahead to see",
    "what has become of the colossal forms:",
    "everything happened at the instant of passing:",
    "the hoof-beat, the whinny, the bells on the harness,",
    "the creak of the wheels, the monkey\u2019s fandango",
    "in double time over the elephant\u2019s back.",
    "When the marching was over and we were free to go on",
    "there was never before us a dungfall or a track",
    "on the road-sands of any kind:",
    "only the motion of footprints being made",
    "crossing and recrossing in the trampled mind."

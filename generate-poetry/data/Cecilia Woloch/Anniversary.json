    "Didn\u2019t I stand there once,",
    "white-knuckled, gripping the just-lit taper,",
    "swearing I\u2019d never go back?",
    "And hadn\u2019t you kissed the rain from my mouth?",
    "And weren\u2019t we gentle and awed and afraid,",
    "knowing we\u2019d stepped from the room of desire",
    "into the further room of love?",
    "And wasn\u2019t it sacred, the sweetness",
    "we licked from each other\u2019s hands?",
    "And were we not lovely, then, were we not",
    "as lovely as thunder, and damp grass, and flame?"

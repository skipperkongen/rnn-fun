    "The telephone never rings. Still",
    "you pick it up, smile into the static,",
    "the breath of those you\u2019ve loved; long dead.",
    "The leaf you pick from the fall",
    "rises and dips away with every ridge.",
    "Fingers stiff from time, you trace.",
    "Staring off into a distance limned",
    "by cataracts and other collected debris,",
    "you have forgotten none of the long-ago joy",
    "of an ice-cream truck and its summer song.",
    "Between the paving stones;",
    "between tea, a cup, and the sound",
    "of you pouring;",
    "between the time you woke that morning",
    "and the time when the letter came,",
    "a tired sorrow: like an old flagellant",
    "able only to tease with a weak sting.",
    "Riding the elevator all day,",
    "floor after floor after floor,",
    "each stop some small victory whittled",
    "from the hard stone of death, you smile.",
    "They used to write epics about moments like this."

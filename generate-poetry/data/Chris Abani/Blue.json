    "I",
    "Africans in the hold fold themselves",
    "to make room for hope. In the afternoon\u2019s",
    "ferocity, tar, grouting the planks like the glue",
    "of family, melts to the run of a child\u2019s licorice stick.",
    "Wet decks crack, testing the wood\u2019s mettle.",
    "Distilled from evaporating brine, salt",
    "dusts the floor, tickling with the measure",
    "into time and the thirst trapped below.",
    "II",
    "The captain\u2019s new cargo of Igbos disturbs him.",
    "They stand, computing the swim back to land.",
    "Haitians still say:",
    "But we do not hang ourselves in cowardice.",
    "III",
    "Sold six times on the journey to the coast,",
    "once for a gun, then cloth, then iron",
    "manilas, her pride was masticated like husks",
    "of chewing sticks, spat from morning-rank mouths.",
    "Breaking loose, edge of handcuffs held high",
    "like the blade of a vengeful axe, she runs",
    "across the salt scratch of deck,",
    "pain deeper than the blue inside a flame.",
    "IV",
    "The sound, like the break of bone",
    "could have been the Captain\u2019s skull",
    "or the musket shot dropping her",
    "over the side, her chains wrapped",
    "around his neck in dance."

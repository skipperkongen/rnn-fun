    "The body is a nation I have not known.",
    "The pure joy of air: the moment between leaping",
    "from a cliff into the wall of blue below. Like that.",
    "Or to feel the rub of tired lungs against skin-",
    "covered bone, like a hand against the rough of bark.",
    "Like that. \u201cThe body is a savage,\u201d I said.",
    "For years I said that: the body is a savage.",
    "As if this safety of the mind were virtue",
    "not cowardice. For years I have snubbed",
    "the dark rub of it, said, \u201cI am better, Lord,",
    "I am better,\u201d but sometimes, in an unguarded",
    "moment of sun, I remember the cowdung-scent",
    "of my childhood skin thick with dirt and sweat",
    "and the screaming grass.",
    "But this distance I keep is not divine,",
    "for what was Christ if not God\u2019s desire",
    "to smell his own armpit? And when I",
    "see him, I know he will smile,",
    "fingers glued to his nose, and say, \u201cNext time",
    "I will send you a down as a dog",
    "to taste this pure hunger.\u201d"

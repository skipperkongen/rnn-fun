    "But of course these poems are",
    "about men,",
    "which we become by defining how",
    "we are not women",
    "and",
    "so becoming",
    "a shadow devouring the light to find the limits",
    "which is what Richard Pryor would have told Joan of Arc",
    "in a joke funnier for being sexist",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s a man thang.\u201d",
    "And of course there is God",
    "and its problematic relationship to light",
    "not to mention the question",
    "of permission",
    "Who builds the box, the shape?",
    "It makes sense that Jesus, the new man 2,000 years ago",
    "was a carpenter.",
    "You need that craft, the precision of measurement",
    "angles of angels",
    "who incidentally are never women.",
    "Just ask the Romans, who called them Angelo, Angelus",
    "never Angela\u2014",
    "that lie was coined by a dissident nun hiding",
    "her feminism under the cover of rapture",
    "but",
    "is it enough to announce yourself?",
    "To beat your chest in contrition calling",
    "Mea culpa! Mea culpa?",
    "Guilt can never be enough",
    "Mere intent\u2014where is its purpose?",
    "Yet there are no answers",
    "there are only lines that disappear",
    "into horizons that girder us with safety",
    "just as there is no way to end this poem."

    "my mother put down her knife and fork,",
    "pulled her wedding ring from its groove,",
    "placing it contemplatively on her middle",
    "finger. So natural was the move,",
    "so tender, I almost didn\u2019t notice.",
    "Five years, she said, five years, once a week,",
    "I wrote a letter to your father. And waited",
    "until time was like ash on my tongue.",
    "Not one letter back, not a single note.",
    "She sighed, smiling, the weight gone. This",
    "prime rib is really tender, isn\u2019t it? she asked."

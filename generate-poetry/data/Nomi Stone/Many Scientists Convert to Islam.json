    "So, if you don\u2019t believe in full it means you don\u2019t",
    "believe. Words tumble onto the rock. A book",
    "happens.",
    "food and women. Who are these women?",
    "My friend says, \u201cThis life is like a twenty-minute train ride.\u201d",
    "He says, \u201cI live inside my",
    "faith more fully every day.\u201d",
    "I am standing on soaked pavement outside",

    "hornets, stinging the sky to let in",
    "what is on the other side.",
    "about the body, denied in the first?",
    "\u201cDo you know the Prophet knew the exact number of bones in the human",
    "body? And why do you ask so many questions? You ask",
    "more questions than you take in breaths of air.\u201d",
    "The birds beat. They crumple in",

    "Kierkegaard says there are three kinds of despair: despair",
    "at not being conscious of having a self, despair at not being",

    "In the cold November current, there is a whirring of wings. Sometimes",
    "they cloud into petals, sometimes they don\u2019t.",
    "When the forehead presses to the earth, the blood moves",
    "down. In the joining, the self lightens. You must count the three perfect",
    "joints of each finger to keep time. Make no mistake, you leave the body only",
    "through the body. The train ride. This quiet voice that is borrowed or my own."

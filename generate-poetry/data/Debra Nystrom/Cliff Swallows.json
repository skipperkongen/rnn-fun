    "Is it some turn of wind",
    "that funnels them all down at once, or",
    "is it their own voices netting",
    "to bring them in\u2014the roll and churr",
    "of hundreds searing through river light",
    "and cliff dust, each to its precise",
    "mud nest on the face",
    "none of our own isolate",
    "groping, wishing need could be sent",
    "so unerringly to solace. But",
    "this silk-skein flashing is like heaven",
    "brought down: not to meet ground",
    "or water\u2014to enter",
    "the riven earth and disappear."

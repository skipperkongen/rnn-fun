    "Little Chihuahita shadowed beside Segundo barrio.",
    "A dead German sheperd with a broken neck lies",
    "on the side of the street for days. The stench",
    "of El Paso\u2019s sewage in the air, a Mexican flag hugely",
    "flaps itself above the chain-linked fence",
    "topped with razor wire. In the morning blue mountains",
    "smog. South side of the border a man jogs.",
    "The river\u2019s bank green, small trees bob in the wind",
    "like truffle-treats, mirage. Each day thousands cross",
    "the open bridge, both ways,",
    "each night they go home to sleep silence. Cars hum",
    "and wait for hours like sleeping cats. A cemented river",
    "half-dried, even the canal drains away. Some say droves",
    "of shadows at night move ghost-like through the dying river.",
    "These people grow invisible, as if air, irrelevant and holy;",
    "at night I can hear the whisper of my grandfather,",
    "\u201call the angels live in Ju\u00e1rez.\u201d",
    "There is an old language broken in my throat.",
    "Some eyes mistake me for shadow. When I speak my voice",
    "a fearful phantom. In spring dust storms come, the sky",
    "browns, my visage half-forms beneath the Italian cypress;",
    "and when the day\u2019s moon is full in its silence,",
    "I am afraid of my own darkness."

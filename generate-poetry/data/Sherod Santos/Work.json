    "Pushing off on her back out",
    "Into the fishpond\u2019s cold",
    "Archaic glitter, my naked wife",
    "Could not have guessed how",
    "High she rode into the noon",
    "Sky, a brightened polestar",
    "Gliding out between nothing",
    "And nothing, between a sun-",
    "Lit vacancy and its ancient,",
    "Reflected, weightless",
    "Hour unrippling back",
    "From the sedges. The just-",
    "Cut grasses fumed around her",
    "Like gasoline, a few",
    "Spent bees dozed above",
    "The compost, and in my arms",
    "The steady",
    "of the mower",
    "Carried on, though I\u2019d",
    "Shut it off to sit down",
    "And watch: but so fond of her,",
    "The water parted to take",
    "Her back from that aimless",
    "Sky, where light-",
    "Headed and slippery as a star",
    "She turtled under the still",
    "Simmering Indian summer",
    "To startle the sunfish",
    "At the margins\u2014then punctured",
    "Back with a blow-frog\u2019s gasp,",
    "An amazed stranger",
    "Conjured into the world",
    "By a willow shadow",
    "Spread out on the grass",
    "Like an extravagant Old",
    "World gesture no",
    "One believes in anymore.",
    "On that stalled shore she climbed",
    "Back out among the cool",
    "And slightly washed-",
    "Out leaves to towel off,",
    "Put on her clothes, and shake",
    "Her hair out in no time",
    "Which slips off into the past,",
    "Or future, into nothing",
    "But the pure unburnished hum-",
    "Drum of that moment, that place,",
    "From which we turned away",
    "Eventually and went back to work."

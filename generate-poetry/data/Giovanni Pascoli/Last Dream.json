    "Out of a motionless infernal",
    "shudder and clang of steel on steel",
    "as wagons moved toward the eternal,",
    "a sudden silence: I was healed.",
    "The stormcloud of my sickness fled",
    "on a breath. A flickering of eyes,",
    "and I saw my mother by my bed",
    "and gazed at her without surprise.",
    "Free! Helpless, yes, to move the hands",
    "clasped on my chest\u2014but I had no",
    "desire to move. The rustling sounds",
    "(like cypress trees, like streams that flow",
    "across vast prairies seeking seas",
    "that don\u2019t exist) were thin, insistent:",
    "I followed after those vain sighs,",
    "ever the same, ever more distant."

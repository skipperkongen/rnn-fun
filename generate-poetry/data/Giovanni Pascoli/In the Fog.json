    "I stared into the valley: it was gone\u2014",
    "wholly submerged! A vast flat sea remained,",
    "gray, with no waves, no beaches; all was one.",
    "And here and there I noticed, when I strained,",
    "the alien clamoring of small, wild voices:",
    "birds that had lost their way in that vain land.",
    "And high above, the skeletons of beeches,",
    "as if suspended, and the reveries",
    "of ruins and of the hermit\u2019s hidden reaches.",
    "And a dog yelped and yelped, as if in fear,",
    "I knew not where nor why. Perhaps he heard",
    "strange footsteps, neither far away nor near\u2014",
    "echoing footsteps, neither slow nor quick,",
    "alternating, eternal. Down I stared,",
    "but I saw nothing, no one, looking back.",
    "The reveries of ruins asked: \u201cWill no",
    "one come?\u201d The skeletons of trees inquired:",
    "\u201cAnd who are you, forever on the go?\u201d",
    "I may have seen a shadow then, an errant",
    "shadow, bearing a bundle on its head.",
    "I saw\u2014and no more saw, in the same instant.",
    "All I could hear were the uneasy screeches",
    "of the lost birds, the yelping of the stray,",
    "and, on that sea that lacked both waves and beaches,",
    "the footsteps, neither near nor far away."

    "Dad would come home after too long at work",
    "and I\u2019d sit on his lap to hear",
    "the story of Ferdinand the Bull; every night,",
    "me handing him the red book until I knew",
    "every word, couldn\u2019t read,",
    "just recite along with drawings",
    "of a gentle bull, frustrated matadors,",
    "the all-important bee, and flowers\u2014",
    "flowers in meadows and flowers",
    "thrown by the Spanish ladies.",
    "Its lesson, really,",
    "about not being what you\u2019re born into",
    "but what you\u2019re born to be,",
    "even if that means",
    "not caring about the capes they wave in your face",
    "or the spears they cut into your shoulders.",
    "And Dad, wonderful Dad, came home",
    "after too long at work",
    "and read to me",
    "the same story every night",
    "until I knew every word, couldn\u2019t read,",
    "just recite."

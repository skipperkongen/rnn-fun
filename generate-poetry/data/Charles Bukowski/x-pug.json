    "he hooked to the body hard",
    "took it well",
    "and loved to fight",
    "had seven in a row and a small fleck",
    "over one eye,",
    "and then he met a kid from Camden",
    "with arms thin as wires\u2014",
    "it was a good one,",
    "the safe lions roared and threw money;",
    "they were both up and down many times,",
    "but he lost that one",
    "and he lost the rematch",
    "in which neither of them fought at all,",
    "hanging on to each other like lovers through the boos,",
    "and now he\u2019s over at Mike\u2019s",
    "changing tires and oil and batteries,",

    "you think the sun\u2019s gonna come out?",
    "to which he\u2019ll usually answer",
    "hell no,",
    "but you\u2019ll have your important tank of gas",
    "and drive off."

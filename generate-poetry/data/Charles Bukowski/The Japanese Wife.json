    "O lord, he said, Japanese women,",
    "real women, they have not forgotten,",
    "bowing and smiling",
    "closing the wounds men have made;",
    "but American women will kill you like they",
    "tear a lampshade,",
    "American women care less than a dime,",
    "they\u2019ve gotten derailed,",
    "they\u2019re too nervous to make good:",
    "always scowling, belly-aching,",
    "disillusioned, overwrought;",
    "but oh lord, say, the Japanese women:",
    "there was this one,",
    "I came home and the door was locked",
    "and when I broke in she broke out the bread knife",
    "and chased me under the bed",
    "and her sister came",
    "and they kept me under that bed for two days,",
    "and when I came out, at last,",
    "she didn\u2019t mention attorneys,",
    "just said, you will never wrong me again,",
    "and I didn\u2019t; but she died on me,",
    "and dying, said, you can wrong me now,",
    "and I did,",
    "but you know, I felt worse then",
    "than when she was living;",
    "there was no voice, no knife,",
    "nothing but little Japanese prints on the wall,",
    "all those tiny people sitting by red rivers",
    "with flying green birds,",
    "and I took them down and put them face down",
    "in a drawer with my shirts,",
    "and it was the first time I realized",
    "that she was dead, even though I buried her;",
    "and some day I\u2019ll take them all out again,",
    "all the tan-faced little people",
    "sitting happily by their bridges and huts",
    "and mountains\u2014",
    "but not right now,",
    "not just yet."

    "Their pens sustain him. At ten, alone,",
    "he walks by the ghosts of a college town,",
    "the bootleggers painted solemn on",
    "the gallery walls, Chicago beamed",
    "into the multiplex, the gnash of police dogs",
    "pantomimed through a flickering reel,",
    "the bus stopping by the curb to take him",
    "to his next one-night stand, the headlights gold",
    "as the waitress shuts out the light,",
    "unscarred,",
    "and heads for the dead of home."

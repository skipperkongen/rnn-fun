    "The first to arrive when the sleepy-eyed coach",
    "grunts good morning and undoes the rusty lock,",

    "before the water tames him back\u2014cutting meat",
    "and treading at the Y each weekend only keeping",

    "his fake leg stretched before him, the coach rasps",

    "the slowest tries standing tough, his feet buckled",
    "in at the water\u2019s edge and every still joint its own",
    "heady fix. When he moves, he moves to reach",
    "the finish line. The team is mired in last, not quailing",
    "from the season\u2019s end the only victory left. All around,",
    "hungry, he eyes the greater meets: the varsity team",
    "that shreds the water twice as fast, the seniors\u2019 cars",
    "and flaunted car keys. Is every test decided",
    "by the one before? Do the mind, the joints ever forget?",
    "He stares down the water, his body cold and primed",
    "for the tournament, finals, anything assigned."

    ", they used to call it\u2014",
    "four passes with the giant round saw",
    "and you had a crosstie, 7 inches by 9 of white oak\u2014",
    "at two hundred pounds nearly twice my weight",
    "and ready to break finger or toe\u2014",
    "like coffin lids, those leftover slabs,",
    "their new-sawn faces turning gold and brown",
    "as my own in the hot Virginia sun,",
    "drying toward the winter and the woodsaw",
    "and on the day of that chore",
    "I turned over a good, thick one",
    "looking for the balance point",
    "and roused a three-foot copperhead,",
    "gold and brown like the wood,",
    "disdaining the shoe it muscled across,",
    "each rib distinct as a needle stitching leather,",
    "heavy on my foot as a crosstie."

  "text": [
    "In early youth\u2019s unclouded scene,",
    "The brilliant morning of eighteen,",
    "With health and sprightly joy elate,",
    "We gazed on youth\u2019s enchanting spring,",
    "Nor thought how quickly time would bring",
    "The mournful period \u2014",
    "!",
    "Then the starch maid, or matron sage,",
    "Already of the sober age,",
    "We viewed with mingled scorn and hate;",
    "In whose sharp words, or sharper face,",
    "With thoughtless mirth, we loved to trace",
    "The sad effects of \u2014",
    "!",
    "Till, saddening, sickening at the view,",
    "We learned to dread what time might do;",
    "And then preferred a prayer to Fate",
    "To end our days ere that arrived,",
    "When (power and pleasure long survived)",
    "We meet neglect, and \u2014",
    "!",
    "But Time, in spite of wishes, flies;",
    "And Fate our simple prayer denies,",
    "And bids us Death\u2019s own hour await!",
    "The auburn locks are mixed with grey,",
    "The transient roses fade away,",
    "But reason comes at \u2014",
    "!",
    "Her voice the anguish contradicts",
    "That dying vanity inflicts;",
    "Her hand new pleasures can create,",
    "For us she opens to the view",
    "Prospect less bright \u2014 but far more true,",
    "And bids us smile at \u2014",
    "!",
    "No more shall Scandal\u2019s breath destroy",
    "The social converse we enjoy",
    "With bard or critic,",
    "\u2014",
    "O\u2019er youth\u2019s bright blooms her blight shall pour,",
    "But spare the improving, friendly hour",
    "Which Science gives at \u2014",
    "!",
    "Stripped of their gaudy hues by Truth,",
    "We view the glittering toys of youth,",
    "And blush to think how poor the bait",
    "For which to public scenes we ran,",
    "And scorned of sober sense the plan",
    "Which gives content at \u2014",
    "!",
    "O may her blessings now arise,",
    "Like stars that mildly light the skies,",
    "When the sun\u2019s ardent rays abate!",
    "And in the luxuries of mind \u2014",
    "In friendship, science \u2014 may we find",
    "Increasing joys at \u2014",
    "!",
    "Though Time\u2019s inexorable sway",
    "Has torn the myrtle bands away,",
    "For other wreaths \u2014 \u2019tis not too late:",
    "The amaranth\u2019s purple glow survives,",
    "And still Minerva\u2019s olive thrives",
    "On the calm brow of \u2014",
    "!",
    "With eye more steady, we engage",
    "To contemplate approaching age,",
    "And life more justly estimate;",
    "With firmer souls and stronger powers,",
    "With reason, faith, and friendship ours,",
    "We\u2019ll not regret the stealing hours",
    "That lead from",
    "e\u2019en to",
    "!"

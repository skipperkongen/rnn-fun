    "Is there a solitary wretch who hies",
    "To the tall cliff, with starting pace or slow,",
    "And, measuring, views with wild and hollow eyes",
    "Its distance from the waves that chide below;",
    "Who, as the sea-born gale with frequent sighs",
    "Chills his cold bed upon the mountain turf,",
    "With hoarse, half-uttered lamentation, lies",
    "Murmuring responses to the dashing surf?",
    "In moody sadness, on the giddy brink,",
    "I see him more with envy than with fear;",
    "has no",
    "that shrink",
    "From giant horrors; wildly wandering here,",
    "He seems (uncursed with reason) not to know",
    "The depth or the duration of his woe."

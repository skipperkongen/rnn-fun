    "Mute is thy wild harp, now, O Bard sublime!",
    "Who, amid Scotia\u2019s mountain solitude,",
    "Great Nature taught to \u201cbuild the lofty rhyme,\u201d",
    "And even beneath the daily pressure, rude,",
    "Of laboring Poverty, thy generous blood,",
    "Fired with the love of freedom\u2014Not subdued",
    "Wert thou by thy low fortune: But a time",
    "Like this we live in, when the abject chime",
    "Of echoing Parasite is best approved,",
    "Was not for thee\u2014Indignantly is fled",
    "Thy noble Spirit; and no longer moved",
    "By all the ills o\u2019er which thine heart has bled,",
    "Associate worthy of the illustrious dead,",
    "Enjoys with them \u201cthe Liberty it loved.\u201d"

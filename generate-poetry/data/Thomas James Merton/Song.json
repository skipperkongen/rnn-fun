    "The bottom of the sea has come",
    "And builded in my noiseless room",
    "The fishes\u2019 and the mermaids\u2019 home,",
    "Whose it is most, most hell to be",
    "Out of the heavy-hanging sea",
    "And in the thin, thin changeable air",
    "Or unroom sleep some other where;",
    "But play their coral violins",
    "Where waters most lock music in:",
    "The bottom of my room, the sea.",
    "Full of voiceless curtaindeep",
    "There mermaid somnambules come sleep",
    "Where fluted half-lights show the way,",
    "And there, there lost orchestras play",
    "And down the many quarterlights come",
    "To the dim mirth of my aquadrome:",
    "The bottom of my sea, the room."

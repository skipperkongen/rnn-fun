    "1",
    "One royal afternoon",
    "When I was young and easily surprised",
    "By uncles coming from the park",
    "At the command of nurses and of guards,",
    "I wondered, over trees and ponds,",
    "At the sorry, rude walls",
    "And the white windows of the apartments.",
    "\u201cThese,\u201d said my uncle, \u201care the tallest houses.\u201d",
    "2",
    "Yes, in the spring of my joy",
    "When I was visibly affected by a gaitered bishop,",
    "Large and unsteady in the flagged yard,",
    "Guards, dogs and blackbirds fled on every hand.",
    "\u201cHe is an old one,\u201d said uncle,",
    "\u201cThe gaiters are real.\u201d",
    "3",
    "Rippled, fistfed windows of your",
    "Dun high houses! Then",
    "Come cages made of pretty willows",
    "Where they put the palace girls!",
    "Green ducks wade slowly from the marble water.",
    "One swan reproves a saucy daughter.",
    "I consider my own true pond,",
    "Look for the beginning and the end.",
    "I lead the bishop down lanes and islands.",
    "4",
    "Yes, in the windows of my first existence",
    "Before my yawns became seasons,",
    "When nurses and uncles were sure,",
    "Chinese fowl fought the frosty water",
    "Startled by this old pontifex.",
    "\u201cNo bridge\u201d (He smiled",
    "Between the budding branches),",
    "\u201cNo crossing to the cage",
    "Of the paradise bird!\u201d",
    "Astounded by the sermons in the leaves",
    "I cried, \u201cNo! No! The stars have higher houses!\u201d",
    "Kicking the robins and ganders",
    "From the floor of his insular world",
    "The magic bishop leaned his blessing on the children.",
    "5",
    "That was the bold day when",
    "Moved by the unexpected summons",
    "I opened all the palace aviaries",
    "As by a king\u2019s representative",
    "I was appointed fowler."

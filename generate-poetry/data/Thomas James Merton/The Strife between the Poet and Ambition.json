    "Money and fame break in the room",
    "And find the poet all alone.",
    "They lock the door, so he won\u2019t run,",

    "Tomorrow, tomorrow Death will come",
    "And find you sitting dumb and senseless",
    "With your epics unbegun,",
    "And take away your pens and pencils\u2014",
    "There\u2019ll be no sculptures on your tomb",
    "And other bards will occupy",

    "And my poetic pocketfox,",
    "My case of literary deers,",

    "They broke the cages and let go",
    "My aviary of metric birds,",
    "And all the diction in my zoo",
    "Was let out by the amateurs!",
    "The fishpond of my Friday words",
    "Is fished out by the days and years.",
    "My whole menagerie of verse",
    "Is ruined by these sly monsieurs!\u201d",
    "The days and years run down the beach",
    "And throw his ideas in the air",
    "And wind his similes up to pitch",
    "And bat his verses out of reach.",
    "He mopes along the empty shore",
    "With gullcries in his windfilled ear.",
    "The hours and minutes, playing catch",
    "With every image they can snatch,",
    "Bat his metaphors to the birds",
    "And cheer him with these bullying words:",

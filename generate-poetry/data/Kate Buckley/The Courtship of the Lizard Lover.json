    "He crawls through the cracks",
    "of my stone foundation,",
    "sly and sleek as",
    "I tempt him with food.",
    "He stays out of habit; I cook",
    "out of love for things that move.",
    "We grow accustomed to each other\u2019s",
    "trails and smells, the skins we\u2019ve shed",
    "along the long, long road",
    "of rubbing each other smooth.",
    "Till all the skins we\u2019ve shed lie sparkling",
    "like so many stones in this desert land.",
    "I scoop him up in my hand",
    "and eat him."

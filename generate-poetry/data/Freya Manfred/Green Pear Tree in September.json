    "On a hill overlooking the Rock River",
    "my father\u2019s pear tree shimmers,",
    "in perfect peace,",
    "covered with hundreds of ripe pears",
    "with pert tops, plump bottoms,",
    "and long curved leaves.",
    "Until the green-haloed tree",
    "rose up and sang hello,",
    "I had forgotten. . .",
    "He planted it twelve years ago,",
    "when he was seventy-three,",
    "so that in September",
    "he could stroll down",
    "with the sound of the crickets",
    "rising and falling around him,",
    "and stand, naked to the waist,",
    "slightly bent, sucking juice",
    "from a ripe pear."

    "Charles Augustus Howell (1869) unshoveled the grave",

    "in their second life as art on a museum wall; a world where",
    "the \u201cconversion pool\u201d saw swimmers step in white robes",
    "from its farther end, reborn to new religion; and the lumbering",
    "land animals said",
    ", and gave up legs, and so their legs rolled up",

    "to the waters, and birthed and breached in the waters,",

    "and spouted out their great Ionic columns of air and water",
    "in the touch of the changing mind of Earth,",
    "that\u2019s sunlit at times",
    "and at other times darkened."

    "O Donald! ye are just the man",
    "Who, when he\u2019s got a wife,",
    "Begins to fratch\u2014 nae notice ta\u2019en\u2014",
    "They\u2019re strangers a\u2019 their life.",

    "Now, truly, these slights are but toys;",
    "But frae neglects like these,",
    "The wife may soon a slattern grow,",
    "And strive nae mair to please.",
    "For wooers ay do all they can",
    "To trifle wi\u2019 the mind;",
    "They hold the blaze of beauty up,",
    "And keep the poor things blind.",
    "But wedlock tears away the veil,",
    "The goddess is nae mair;",
    "He thinks his wife a silly thing,",
    "She thinks her man a bear.",
    "Let then the lover be the friend\u2014",
    "The loving friend for life;",
    "Think but thysel the happiest spouse,",
    "She\u2019ll be the happiest wife."

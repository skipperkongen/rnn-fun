    "How is it that the snow",
    "amplifies the silence,",
    "slathers the black bark on limbs,",
    "heaps along the brush rows?",
    "Some deer have stood on their hind legs",
    "to pull the berries down.",
    "Now they are ghosts along the path,",
    "snow flecked with red wine stains.",
    "This silence in the timbers.",
    "A woodpecker on one of the trees",
    "taps out its story,",
    "stopping now and then in the lapse",
    "of one white moment into another."

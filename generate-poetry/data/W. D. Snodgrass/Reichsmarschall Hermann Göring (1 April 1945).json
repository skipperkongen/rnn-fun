    "And why, Herr Reichsmarschall, is Italy",
    "Just like schnitzel?",
    "Either one will just get bigger.",
    "Neither cuts too firm a figure.",
    "Still, all this humble pie you\u2019ve eaten",
    "Lately, fills you out quite prettily.",
    "Why then, Herr G\u00f6ring, how can we",
    "Tell you and Italy apart?",
    "I, just the opposite, by using",
    "High skills and cunning learned the art",
    "Of flat pratfalls through victory.",
    "You've led our Flying Circus; how",
    "Could our war ace turn to a clown?",
    "Both keep alive doing slick stunts",
    "And, even so, both get shot down.",

    "Either\u2019s bound to follow ordures;",
    "They both expand and play the swell",
    "Though something\u2019s getting spoiled somewhere.",
    "Then answer one more question, which is",
    "Are politicians like whipped cream?",
    "Also they both puff up your ass",
    "Till you\u2019re exposed like some bad dream",
    "Where you\u2019ve grown too big for your britches.",
    "Herr President, can\u2019t we tell apart",
    "An artful statesman and an ass?",
    "One makes low rumblings after meals.",
    "But that\u2019s the threat of leaking gas",
    "Which all men fear!",
    "Last, could you give one simple rule",
    "To tell a medal from a turd?",
    "Conveying their opinion of you.",
    "Right! Here\u2019s your new medal, conferred",
    "For vast achievements: April Fool!"

    "There is a better thing, dear heart,",

    "The heart that yearns for all in need,",

    "To selfish thought or lowly deed.",
    "All that we ever dreamed, dear wife,",
    "Seems drab and common by the truth,",
    "The sweet sad mellow things of life",
    "Are more than golden dreams of youth."

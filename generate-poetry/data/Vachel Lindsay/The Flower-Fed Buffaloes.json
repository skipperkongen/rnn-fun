    "The flower-fed buffaloes of the spring",
    "In the days of long ago,",
    "Ranged where the locomotives sing",
    "And the prairie flowers lie low:\u2014",
    "The tossing, blooming, perfumed grass",
    "Is swept away by the wheat,",
    "Wheels and wheels and wheels spin by",
    "In the spring that still is sweet.",
    "But the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring",
    "Left us, long ago.",
    "They gore no more, they bellow no more,",
    "They trundle around the hills no more:\u2014",
    "With the Blackfeet, lying low,",
    "With the Pawnees, lying low,",
    "Lying low."

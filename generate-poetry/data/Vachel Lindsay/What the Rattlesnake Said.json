    "The Moon's a little prairie-dog.",
    "He shivers through the night.",
    "He sits upon his hill and cries",
    "For fear that I will bite.",
    "The Sun's a broncho. He's afraid",
    "Like every other thing,",
    "And trembles morning, noon and night",
    "Lest I should spring and sting."

    "What are we bound for? What\u2019s the yield",
    "Of all this energy and waste?",
    "Why do we spend ourselves and build",
    "With such an empty haste?",
    "Wherefore the bravery we boast?",
    "How can we spend one laughing breath",
    "When at the end all things are lost",
    "In ignorance and death? . . .",
    "The stars have found a blazing course",
    "In a vast curve that cuts through space;",
    "Enough for us to feel that force",
    "Swinging us through the days.",
    "Enough that we have strength to sing",
    "And fight and somehow scorn the grave;",
    "That Life\u2019s too bold and bright a thing",
    "To question or to save."

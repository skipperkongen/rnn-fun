    "Why are the things that have no death",
    "The ones with neither sight nor breath!",
    "Eternity is thrust upon",
    "A bit of earth, a senseless stone.",
    "A grain of dust, a casual clod",
    "Receives the greatest gift of God.",
    "A pebble in the roadway lies\u0097",
    "It never dies.",
    "The grass our fathers cut away",
    "Is growing on their graves today;",
    "The tiniest brooks that scarcely flow",
    "Eternally will come and go.",
    "There is no kind of death to kill",
    "The sands that lie so meek and still. . . .",
    "But Man is great and strong and wise\u0097",
    "And so he dies."

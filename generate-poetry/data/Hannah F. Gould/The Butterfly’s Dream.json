    "A tulip, just opened, had offered to hold",
    "A butterfly, gaudy and gay;",
    "And, rocked in a cradle of crimson and gold,",
    "The careless young slumberer lay.",
    "For the butterfly slept, as such thoughtless ones will,",
    "At ease, and reclining on flowers,",
    "If ever they study, \u2019t is how they may kill",
    "The best of their mid-summer hours.",
    "And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case",
    "With",
    "lovers of change,",
    "Who, keeping the body at ease in its place,",
    "Give fancy permission to range.",
    "He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise,",
    "The swarm from a neighbouring hive;",
    "Which, having come out for their winter supplies,",
    "Had made the whole garden alive.",
    "He looked with disgust, as the proud often do,",
    "On the diligent movements of those,",
    "Who, keeping both present and future in view,",
    "Improve every hour as it goes.",
    "As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro,",
    "With anger the butterfly swelled;",
    "And called them mechanics \u2013 a rabble too low",
    "To come near the station he held.",
    "\u2018Away from my presence!\u2019 said he, in his sleep,",
    "\u2018Ye humbled plebeians! nor dare",
    "Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep",
    "The king of this brilliant parterre!\u2019",
    "He thought, at these words, that together they flew,",
    "And, facing about, made a stand;",
    "And then, to a terrible army they grew,",
    "And fenced him on every hand.",
    "Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes",
    "Seemed spreading to measureless size:",
    "Their wings with a mighty expansion arose,",
    "And stretched like a veil o\u2019er the skies.",
    "Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,\u2014",
    "Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,\u2014",
    "Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire,",
    "And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne.",
    "He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound,",
    "His head ached \u2013 his throne reeled and fell;",
    "His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground,",
    "And cried, \u2018King Papilio, farewell!\u2019",
    "His fall chased the vision \u2013 the sleeper awoke,",
    "The wonderful dream to expound;",
    "The lightning\u2019s bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke,",
    "And hail-stones were rattling around.",
    "He\u2019d slumbered so long, that now, over his head,",
    "The tempest\u2019s artillery rolled;",
    "The tulip was shattered \u2013 the whirl-blast had fled,",
    "And borne off its crimson and gold.",
    "\u2019T is said, for the fall and the pelting, combined",
    "With suppressed ebullitions of pride,",
    "This vain son of summer no balsam could find,",
    "But he crept under covert and died."

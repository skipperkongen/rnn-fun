    "Driving to the new dentist\u2019s office",
    "the slow drive of a new place",

    "road signs that break apart, the fork in the road",
    "that looks nothing like a fork or a spoon, in fact",
    "at best, maybe a knife bent in a dishwasher",
    "that leans to one side. And I know the dentist",
    "will ask about my last visit and want to know",
    "in months that I can\u2019t say some time ago",
    "and I know he will ask me about flossing",
    "and saying when I\u2019m in the mood won\u2019t be",
    "the appropriate answer.",
    "He will call out my cavities",
    "as if they were names in a class.",
    "I brush my teeth before going in.",
    "It\u2019s like cleaning before the cleaning person",
    "but I don\u2019t want him to know I keep an untidy",
    "mouth. That I am the type of person who shoves",
    "things in the closet before guests arrive."

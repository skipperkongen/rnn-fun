    "Beside the rivers of the midnight town",
    "Where four-foot couples love and paupers drown,",
    "Shots of quick hell we took, our final kiss,",
    "The great and swinging bridge a bower for this.",
    "Your cheek lay burning in my fingers\u2019 cup;",
    "Often my lip moved downward and yours up",
    "Till both adjusted, tightened, locksmith-true:",
    "The flesh precise, the crazy brain askew.",
    "Roughly the train with grim and piston knee",
    "Pounded apart our pleasure, you from me;",
    "Flare warned and ticket whispered and bell cried.",
    "Time and the locks of bitter rail divide.",
    "For ease remember, all that parted lie:",
    "Men who in camp of shot or doldrum die,",
    "Who at land\u2019s-end eternal furlough take",
    "\u2014This for memento as alone you wake."

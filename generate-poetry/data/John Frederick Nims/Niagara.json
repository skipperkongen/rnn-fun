    "I",
    "Driving westward near Niagara, that transfiguring of the waters,",
    "I was torn\u2014as moon from orbit by a warping of gravitation\u2014",
    "From coercion of the freeway to the cataract\u2019s prodigality,",
    "Had to stand there, breathe its rapture, inebriety of the precipice . . .",
    "Fingers clamped to iron railings in a tremor of earth\u2019s vibration,",
    "I look upstream: foam and boulders wail with a biblical desolation,",
    "Tree roots, broken oar, a pier end, wrack of the continent dissolving . . .",
    "Braced, like tunnel workers hunching from implosion of locomotives,",
    "I look down: to ancient chaos, scrawl of the fog for commentary,",
    "Misty scripture\u2014Delphic, Jungian\u2014all mythology in gestation,",
    "Mists that chill our face in passing, soar to a mushroom luminescence . . .",
    "In between, where halos dazzle\u2014as, on a high wire, spangled dancers\u2014",
    "On the brink those waters sluice to, in the devil-may-care insouciance",
    "Of their roistering to glory, no forewarning of what impends, till",
    "Solid earth dissolves beneath them; all they had banked on once, vacuity . . .",
    "Kindled in the hollow wind they flare to a greenish incandescence;",
    "Channels they defined so smartly in the gusto of their careening",
    "All behind them now; before them, blinding haze and the noon\u2019s diffusion . . .",
    "II",
    "Ten feet over those, our railing perched on a spur where verge and void\u2014there!\u2014",
    "Hiss and arc to touch each other, matter and shadow-matter fuming,",
    "We stare through the flow to bedrock, flashing its Kodachrome geology.",
    "Images swirl by\u2014real, fancied\u2014bits of hallucinated litter:",
    "Gold of oak leaf, taffy wrapper, lavender airmail\u2014assignation?",
    "Yellow Kodak pack, pied comics, tissue a crimson lip had stippled",
    "(Let\u2019s imagine). Some shows vivid, fresh-shellacked in the river\u2019s sepia,",
    "All no sooner seen than vanished\u2014on to the brink, its foaming rotos",
    "Hoarse as all earth\u2019s turbines turning in a thunder of synchronicity.",
    "How deep toward the edge? waist? shoulder? as through a woozy lens we scan its",
    "Floor, old temple tesselation\u2014",
    "No, terrain of the moon! Medusa\u2019s",
    "Ancient face, and we stare frozen: stony glare in its vipers\u2019 tangle . . .",
    "Still a thought returns and troubles: \u201cno forewarning of what impends, till\u2014\u201d",
    "Shadow of",
    "\u2014more menace coiled in the word than fact itself has:",
    "Fact erodes in action: Athens, in the arroyos of her theater,",
    "Leaned to watch the self-destructing of her blinded grandiosities,",
    "Willfulness and Will, a crash course; then, too late for it, anagnorisis;",
    "Purged of trivia through immersion in the clotted baths of tragedy,",
    "Then she knew and was transfigured by contrarious exaltations . . .",
    "III",
    "Eyes can\u2019t leave the livid seething, its reiterative",
    "Reading, in this bubble chamber, stuff of the world as effervescence,",
    "Reading every life as half-life, reading in foam the one prognosis . . .",
    "Mac the trucker\u2014checkered mackinaw, sort of a baseball cap with earflaps,",
    "Fists to crinkle up his beer cans\u2014here at the falls is philosophical:",
    "\u201cDown the tube. That\u2019s life\u201d\u2014he\u2019s waggish, nudging his cozy blonde\u2014\u201cYou",
    "know, hon?\u201d",
    "And she knows. We all know: Nature, making a splendor of our banalities,",
    "Lavishes Niagara on us, nudging our knack for the anagogical . . .",
    "Meanwhile, earth itself rolls over, nations caught in its tug of traction,",
    "From the brink of noon to darkness (but the grandeur of the transition!)",
    "Gone, like taffy wrapper, tissue:",
    "ferny world of the stegosaurus,",
    "Heraclitus, toe in rivers, Coriolanus in Corioli,",
    "Dancing T\u2019ang girl, belles of Bali, kings of France with the Roman numerals,",

    "All things",
    ", things current\u2014what a word with the gorge before us!\u2014",
    "All our bookshelves, facts in folio, paleontology, agronomy,",
    "Jewels from that cluttered dump, statistics\u2014",
    "many a scuffed Aladdin\u2019s lamp there:",
    "As: one cell\u2019s genetic lore\u2019d fill seventy-five Manhattan phone books;",
    "As: for each poor soul among us, many a galaxy out there somewhere,",
    "Each of us more precious\u2014rarer!\u2014than a glittering island universe . . .",
    "We could catalogue forever; there\u2019s no end to the world\u2019s diversity,",
    "All that affluence from somewhere, more than a continent behind it;",
    "There\u2019s no diminution either from the torrential cornucopia",

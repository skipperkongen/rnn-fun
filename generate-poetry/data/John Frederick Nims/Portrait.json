    "Seeing in crowded restaurants the one you love",
    "You wave at the door, tall girl in imperious fur,",
    "And make for him, bumping waiters, dropping a glove,",
    "Arriving soft with affectionate slur.",
    "As ladies half-turn, gazing, and men appraise",
    "You heap the linen with purse, scarf, cigarettes, lighter,",
    "Laughing some instantaneous droll phrase.",
    "As if sudden sun came out, the table is brighter.",
    "All moods: at a party everybody\u2019s delight;",
    "Intent while brown curls shadow the serious page;",
    "When people are stuffy (more correct than right)",
    "The stamp and turn on heel of a little girl\u2019s rage.",
    "But woman mostly, as winter moonlight sees,",
    "Impetuous midnight, and the dune\u2019s dark trees."

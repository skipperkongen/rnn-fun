    "Down here, no light but what we carry with us.",
    "Everywhere we point our hands we scrawl",
    "color: bulging eyes, spines, teeth or clinging tentacles.",
    "At negative buoyancy, when heavy hands",
    "seem to grasp & pull us down, we let them,",
    "we don\u2019t inflate our vests, but let the scrubbed cheeks",
    "of rocks slide past in amniotic calm.",
    "At sixty feet we douse our lights, cemented",
    "by the weight of the dark, of water, the grip",
    "of the sea\u2019s absolute silence. Our groping",
    "hands brush the open mouths of anemones,",
    "which shower us in particles of phosphor",
    "radiant as halos. As in meditation,",
    "or in deepest prayer,",
    "there is no knowing what we will see."

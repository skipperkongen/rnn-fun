    "Fawns in the winter wood",
    "Who feel their horns, and leap,",

    "Of evening stirs from sleep,",
    "Tall flowers that unfurl",
    "As a moth, driven, flies,",
    "Flowers with the breasts of a girl",
    "And sea-cold eyes.",
    "The bare bright mirrors glow",
    "For their enchanted shapes.",
    "Each is a flame, and so,",
    "Like flame, escapes."

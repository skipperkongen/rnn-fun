    "Into this net of leaves, green as old glass",
    "That the sun fondles, trembling like images",
    "In water, this live net, swung overhead",
    "From branch to branch, what swam? The spider\u2019s thread",
    "Is less passive, where it appears to float",
    "Like a bright hair clinging to the wind\u2019s coat.",
    "Hot at work, history neither schemes nor grieves",
    "Here where the soaking dead are last year\u2019s leaves,",
    "And over them slung, meshed with sun, a net",
    "No creature wove, none frantically tried to fret.",
    "The huge weight of time without its sting",
    "Hangs in that greenly cradling woof. A wing",
    "Has caught there, held. Held. But not to stay,",
    "We know, who, how slowly, walk away."

    "\u201cPainting a wave requires no system,\u201d",
    "The painter said, painting a wave.",
    "\u201cSystems may get you flotsam and jetsam,",
    "Seaweed and so forth. But never a wave.\u201d",
    "There was a scroll or fine-lined curve",
    "On the canvas first, and then what looked",
    "Like hair flying or grayish nerves,",
    "Which began to move as the painter worked.",
    "\u201cPainting the sea is a lot of trouble;",
    "It never stops still for a moment, so",
    "I try to make it internal, mental,",
    "As though I stopped it, then let it go.\u201d",
    "Something began to pulse and tumble",
    "Out of the brushes, the ink, the chalk;",
    "A long black line commenced to tremble,",
    "Then, like a fishline, started to jerk . . .",
    "With what at the end? \u201cI think I\u2019ve caught it.\u201d",
    "A drop of water hung by a hair.",
    "\u201cIf I could only stop it a minute!\u201d",
    "The drop began to race somewhere,",
    "Spreading out in every direction,",
    "A bird of thread, caught in a storm,",
    "Trying to say, \u201cConnection! Action!\u201d",
    "But in the end it was very calm.",
    "Soon there was water under water,",
    "And over the sand a sun . . . a moon?",
    "Who could have seen that wave of water",
    "One night ago? Or a thousand and one?",
    "Who could have seen the lid of water",
    "With its thin mascara of buoys and corks,",
    "With its lined horizon\u2019s distant glimmer",
    "Of maybe a skyline like New York\u2019s?",
    "Now there will be that morning evening",
    "Tide dyeing the water\u2019s pulse,",
    "The wave drying in ink.",
    ".",
    "Moving, momentous, motionless."

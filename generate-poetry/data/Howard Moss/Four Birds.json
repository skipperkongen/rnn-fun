    "\u201cWake to the sun,\u201d the rooster croaked,",
    "First bird of the day. The world, light-flecked,",
    "Chiselled its lineaments into form.",
    "Where was all that fine light coming from?",
    "\u201cTrance at the wonder,\u201d the second sang.",
    "Whose five dry notes urged the ongoing",
    "Afternoon on. \u201cWhy wake and stir?\u201d",
    "It asked. And asked. There was no answer.",
    "\u201cLive through the muddle.\u201d That from the next one.",
    "Not very helpful. It looked like rain,",
    "Or fog in the offing. Twilight. Then",
    "It sang again from an oak or pine.",
    "Silence. How I waited for the fourth!",
    "Time was a negative dipped into its bath,",
    "The dark a fixative that slowly made",
    "For every windowpane its window shade.",
    "No messages arrived. No music bared",
    "The soul for its penitence. Up the stairs",
    "No hint of a footfall. The night passed.",
    "\u201cCroak by your hand,\u201d said the crow at last."

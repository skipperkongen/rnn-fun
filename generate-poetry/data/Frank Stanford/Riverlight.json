    "My father and I lie down together.",
    "He is dead.",
    "We look up at the stars, the steady sound",
    "Of the wind turning the night like a ceiling fan.",
    "This is our home.",
    "I remember the work in him",
    "Like bitterness in persimmons before a frost.",
    "And I imagine the way he had fear,",
    "The ground turning dark in a rain.",
    "Now he gets up.",
    "And I dream he looks down in my eyes",
    "And watches me die."

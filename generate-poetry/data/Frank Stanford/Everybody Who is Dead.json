    "When a man knows another man",
    "Is looking for him",
    "He doesn\u2019t hide.",
    "He doesn\u2019t wait",
    "To spend another night",
    "With his wife",
    "Or put his children to sleep.",
    "He puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit",
    "And goes to the barber shop",
    "To let another man shave him.",
    "He shuts his eyes",
    "Remembers himself as a boy",
    "Lying naked on a rock by the water.",
    "Then he asks for the special lotion.",
    "The old men line up by the chair",
    "And the barber pours a little",
    "In each of their hands."

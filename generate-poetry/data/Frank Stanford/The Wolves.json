    "at night while the dogs",
    "were barking",
    "Baby Gauge and I crawled under the fence",
    "with knives",
    "we made out like the rattlesnake melons",
    "were men we didn\u2019t like",
    "the new moon ones were wolves",
    "I would cut a belly this way",
    "he would cut a belly that way",
    "the flies",
    "came around the sweet juice",
    "it was blood to us",
    "we tasted it we licked it off the blades",
    "we decided not to kill the wolves",
    "we wanted to be wolves",
    "we stuck the knives in the ground",
    "the moon shined on them",
    "we turned the pilot caps inside out",
    "so the fur would show",
    "that way when we crawled",
    "under the bob wire",
    "a little piece would get caught",
    "we wouldn\u2019t though",
    "we wanted to leave trails",
    "but no scents",
    "we tore the melons open we licked the blood off our paws",
    "we wanted to be wolves",
    "and in the morning all those dead men",
    "with their hearts eat out"

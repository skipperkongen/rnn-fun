    "Sundays too my father got up early",
    "and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,",
    "then with cracked hands that ached",
    "from labor in the weekday weather made",
    "banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.",
    "I\u2019d wake and hear the cold splintering,",
    "the rooms were warm, he\u2019d call,",
    "and slowly I would rise and dress,",
    "fearing the chronic angers of that house,",
    "Speaking indifferently to him,",
    "driven out the cold",
    "and polished my good shoes as well.",
    "What did I know, what did I know",
    "of love\u2019s",
    "and lonely offices?"

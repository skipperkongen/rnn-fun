    "Her hand is at the feedbag at her waist,",
    "sunk to the wrist in the rustling grain",
    "that nuzzles her fingertips when laced",
    "around a sifting handful. It\u2019s like rain,",
    "like cupping water in your hand, she thinks,",
    "the cracks between the fingers like a sieve,",
    "except that less escapes you through the chinks",
    "when handling grain. She likes to feel it give",
    "beneath her hand\u2019s slow plummet, and the smell,",
    "so rich a fragrance she has never quite",
    "got used to it, under the seeming spell",
    "of the charm of the commonplace. The white",
    "hens bunch and strut, heads cocked, with tilted eyes,",
    "till her hand sweeps out and the small grain flies."

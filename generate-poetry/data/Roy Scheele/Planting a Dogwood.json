    "Tree, we take leave of you; you\u2019re on your own.",
    "Put down your taproot with its probing hairs",
    "that sluice the darkness and create unseen",
    "the tree that mirrors you below the ground.",
    "For when we plant a tree, two trees take root:",
    "the one that lifts its leaves into the air,",
    "and the inverted one that cleaves the soil",
    "to find the runnel\u2019s sweet, dull silver trace",
    "and spreads not up but down, each drop a leaf",
    "in the eternal blackness of that sky.",
    "The leaves you show uncurl like tiny fists",
    "and bear small button blossoms, greenish white,",
    "that quicken you. Now put your roots down deep;",
    "draw light from shadow, break in on earth\u2019s sleep."

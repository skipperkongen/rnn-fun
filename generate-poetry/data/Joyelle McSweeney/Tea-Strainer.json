    "Leaf-keep, un-sibyl; if the soul",
    "Has the weight of a swallow, what less",

    "This riddle, unposed in your dish",
    "As a hand at rest in a lap. Held to,",
    "You hold back what can't be",
    "Prevented, what's no more palatable",
    "For that: the unfine; formerly, our future."

    "What bright soft thing is this?",
    "Sweet Mary, the fair eyes\u2019 expense?",
    "A moist spark it is,",
    "A wat\u2019ry diamond; from whence",
    "The very term, I think, was found",
    "The water of a diamond.",
    "O \u2019tis not a tear,",
    "\u2019Tis a star about to drop",
    "From thine eye its sphere;",
    "The sun will stoop and take it up.",
    "Proud will his sister be to wear",
    "This thine eyes\u2019 jewel in her ear.",
    "O \u2019tis a tear",
    "Too true a tear; for no sad eyne,",
    "How sad so e\u2019re,",
    "Rain so true a teare as thine;",
    "Each drop leaving a place so dear,",
    "Weeps for itself, is its own tear.",
    "Such a pearl as this is,",
    "(Slipped from Aurora\u2019s dewy breast)",
    "The rose bud\u2019s sweet lip kisses;",
    "And such the rose itself, when vexed",
    "With ungentle flames, does shed,",
    "Sweating in too warm a bed.",
    "Such the maiden gem,",
    "By the wanton spring put on,",
    "Peeps from her parent stem,",
    "And blushes on the manly sun:",
    "This wat\u2019ry blossom of thy eyne,",
    "Ripe, will make the richer wine.",
    "Faire drop, why quak\u2019st thou so?",
    "\u2019Cause thou straight must lay thy head",
    "In the dust? o no;",
    "The dust shall never be thy bed:",
    "A pillow for thee will I bring,",
    "Stuffed with down of angels\u2019 wing.",
    "Thus carried up on high,",
    "(For to Heaven thou must go)",
    "Sweetly shalt thou lie",
    "And in soft slumbers bathe thy woe;",
    "Till the singing orbs awake thee,",
    "And one of their bright chorus make thee.",
    "There thy self shalt be",
    "An eye, but not a weeping one,",
    "Yet I doubt of thee,",
    "Whether th\u2019hadst rather there have shone",
    "An eye of Heaven; or still shine here,",
    "In th\u2019Heaven of Mary\u2019s eye, a tear."

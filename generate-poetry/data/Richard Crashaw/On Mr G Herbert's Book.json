    "Know you fair, on what you look;",
    "Divinest love lies in this book,",
    "Expecting fire from your eyes,",
    "To kindle this his sacrifice.",
    "When your hands untie these strings,",
    "Think you\u2019have an angel by th\u2019 wings.",
    "One that gladly will be nigh,",
    "To wait upon each morning sigh.",
    "To flutter in the balmy air",
    "Of your well-perfumed prayer.",
    "These white plumes of his he\u2019ll lend you,",
    "Which every day to heaven will send you,",
    "To take acquaintance of the sphere,",
    "And all the smooth-fac\u2019d kindred there.",
    "And though Herbert\u2019s name do owe",
    "These devotions, fairest, know",
    "That while I lay them on the shrine",
    "Of your white hand, they are mine."

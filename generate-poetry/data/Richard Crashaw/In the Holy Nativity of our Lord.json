    "CHORUS",
    "Come we shepherds whose blest sight",
    "Hath met love\u2019s noon in nature\u2019s night;",
    "Come lift we up our loftier song",
    "And wake the sun that lies too long.",
    "To all our world of well-stol\u2019n joy",
    "He slept, and dreamt of no such thing,",
    "While we found out heav\u2019n\u2019s fairer eye,",
    "And kiss\u2019d the cradle of our King.",
    "Tell him he rises now too late",
    "To show us aught worth looking at.",
    "Tell him we now can show him more",
    "Than he e\u2019er show\u2019d to mortal sight,",
    "Than he himself e\u2019er saw before,",
    "Which to be seen needs not his light.",
    "Tell him, Tityrus, where th\u2019 hast been;",
    "Tell him, Thyrsis, what th\u2019 hast seen.",
    "TITYRUS",
    "Gloomy night embrac\u2019d the place",
    "Where the Noble Infant lay;",
    "The Babe look\u2019d up and show\u2019d his face,",
    "In spite of darkness, it was day.",
    "It was thy day, Sweet! and did rise",
    "Not from the east, but from thine eyes.",
    "CHORUS",
    "It was thy day, Sweet! and did rise",
    "Not from the east, but from thine eyes.",
    "THYRSIS",
    "Winter chid aloud, and sent",
    "The angry North to wage his wars;",
    "The North forgot his fierce intent,",
    "And left perfumes instead of scars.",
    "By those sweet eyes\u2019 persuasive pow\u2019rs,",
    "Where he meant frost, he scatter\u2019d flow\u2019rs.",
    "CHORUS",
    "By those sweet eyes\u2019 persuasive pow\u2019rs,",
    "Where he meant frost, he scatter\u2019d flow\u2019rs.",
    "BOTH",
    "We saw thee in thy balmy nest,",
    "Young dawn of our eternal day!",
    "We saw thine eyes break from their east",
    "And chase the trembling shades away.",
    "We saw thee, and we bless\u2019d the sight,",
    "We saw thee by thine own sweet light.",
    "TITYRUS",
    "Poor World, said I, what wilt thou do",
    "To entertain this starry stranger?",
    "Is this the best thou canst bestow,",
    "A cold, and not too cleanly, manger?",
    "Contend, ye powers of heav\u2019n and earth,",
    "To fit a bed for this huge birth.",
    "CHORUS",
    "Contend, ye powers of heav\u2019n and earth,",
    "To fit a bed for this huge birth.",
    "THYRSIS",
    "Proud World, said I, cease your contest,",
    "And let the Mighty Babe alone;",
    "The phoenix builds the phoenix\u2019 nest,",
    "Love\u2019s architecture is his own;",
    "The Babe whose birth embraves this morn,",
    "Made his own bed ere he was born.",
    "CHORUS",
    "The Babe whose birth embraves this morn,",
    "Made his own bed ere he was born.",
    "TITYRUS",
    "I saw the curl\u2019d drops, soft and slow,",
    "Come hovering o\u2019er the place\u2019s head,",
    "Off\u2019ring their whitest sheets of snow",
    "To furnish the fair Infant\u2019s bed.",
    "Forbear, said I, be not too bold;",
    "Your fleece is white, but \u2019tis too cold.",
    "CHORUS",
    "Forbear, said I, be not too bold;",
    "Your fleece is white, but \u2019tis too cold.",
    "THYRSIS",
    "I saw the obsequious Seraphims",
    "Their rosy fleece of fire bestow;",
    "For well they now can spare their wings,",
    "Since Heav\u2019n itself lies here below.",
    "Well done, said I, but are you sure",
    "Your down so warm will pass for pure?",
    "CHORUS",
    "Well done, said I, but are you sure",
    "Your down so warm will pass for pure?",
    "TITYRUS",
    "No no, your King\u2019s not yet to seek",
    "Where to repose his royal head;",
    "See see, how soon his new-bloom\u2019d cheek",
    "\u2019Twixt\u2019s mother\u2019s breasts is gone to bed.",
    "Sweet choice, said we! no way but so,",
    "Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow.",
    "CHORUS",
    "Sweet choice, said we! no way but so,",
    "Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow.",
    "BOTH",
    "We saw thee in thy balmy nest,",
    "Bright dawn of our eternal day!",
    "We saw thine eyes break from their east,",
    "And chase the trembling shades away.",
    "We saw thee, and we bless\u2019d the sight,",
    "We saw thee, by thine own sweet light.",
    "CHORUS",
    "We saw thee, and we bless\u2019d the sight,",
    "We saw thee, by thine own sweet light.",
    "FULL CHORUS",
    "Welcome, all wonders in one sight!",
    "Eternity shut in a span;",
    "Summer in winter; day in night;",
    "Heaven in earth, and God in man.",
    "Great little one, whose all-embracing birth",
    "Lifts earth to heaven, stoops heav\u2019n to earth.",
    "Welcome; though nor to gold nor silk,",
    "To more than Caesar\u2019s birthright is;",
    "Two sister seas of virgin-milk,",
    "With many a rarely temper\u2019d kiss,",
    "That breathes at once both maid and mother,",
    "Warms in the one, cools in the other.",
    "Welcome, though not to those gay flies",
    "Gilded i\u2019 th\u2019 beams of earthly kings,",
    "Slippery souls in smiling eyes;",
    "But to poor shepherds, homespun things,",
    "Whose wealth\u2019s their flock, whose wit, to be",
    "Well read in their simplicity.",
    "Yet when young April\u2019s husband-show\u2019rs",
    "Shall bless the fruitful Maia\u2019s bed,",
    "We\u2019ll bring the first-born of her flow\u2019rs",
    "To kiss thy feet and crown thy head.",
    "To thee, dread Lamb! whose love must keep",
    "The shepherds more than they the sheep.",
    "To thee, meek Majesty! soft King",
    "Of simple graces and sweet loves,",
    "Each of us his lamb will bring,",
    "Each his pair of silver doves;",
    "Till burnt at last in fire of thy fair eyes,",
    "Ourselves become our own best sacrifice."

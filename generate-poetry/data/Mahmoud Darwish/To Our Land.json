    "To our land,",
    "and it is the one near the word of god,",
    "a ceiling of clouds",
    "To our land,",
    "and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns,",
    "the map of absence",
    "To our land,",
    "and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed,",
    "a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasm",
    "To our land,",
    "and it is the one poor as a grouse\u2019s wings,",
    "holy books ... and an identity wound",
    "To our land,",
    "and it is the one surrounded with torn hills,",
    "the ambush of a new past",
    "To our land, and it is a prize of war,",
    "the freedom to die from longing and burning",
    "and our land, in its bloodied night,",
    "is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the far",
    "and illuminates what\u2019s outside it ...",
    "As for us, inside,",
    "we suffocate more!"

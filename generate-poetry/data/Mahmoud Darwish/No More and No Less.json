    "I am a woman. No more and no less",
    "I live my life as it is",
    "thread by thread",
    "and I spin my wool to wear, not",
    "to complete Homer\u2019s story, or his sun.",
    "And I see what I see",
    "as it is, in its shape,",
    "though I stare every once",
    "in a while in its shade",
    "to sense the pulse of defeat,",
    "and I write tomorrow",
    "on yesterday\u2019s sheets: there\u2019s no sound",
    "other than echo.",
    "I love the necessary vagueness in",
    "what a night traveler says to the absence",
    "of birds over the slopes of speech",
    "and above the roofs of villages",
    "I am a woman, no more and no less",
    "The almond blossom sends me flying",
    "in March, from my balcony,",
    "in longing for what the faraway says:",
    "\u201cTouch me and I\u2019ll bring my horses to the water springs.\u201d",
    "I cry for no clear reason, and I love you",
    "as you are, not as a strut",
    "nor in vain",
    "and from my shoulders a morning rises onto you",
    "and falls into you, when I embrace you, a night.",
    "But I am neither one nor the other",
    "no, I am not a sun or a moon",
    "I am a woman, no more and no less",
    "So be the Qyss of longing,",
    "if you wish. As for me",
    "I like to be loved as I am",
    "not as a color photo",
    "in the paper, or as an idea",
    "composed in a poem amid the stags \u2026",
    "I hear Laila\u2019s faraway scream",
    "from the bedroom: Do not leave me",
    "a prisoner of rhyme in the tribal nights",
    "do not leave me to them as news \u2026",
    "I am a woman, no more and no less",
    "I am who I am, as",
    "you are who you are: you live in me",
    "and I live in you, to and for you",
    "I love the necessary clarity of our mutual puzzle",
    "I am yours when I overflow the night",
    "but I am not a land",
    "or a journey",
    "I am a woman, no more and no less",
    "And I tire",
    "from the moon\u2019s feminine cycle",
    "and my guitar falls ill",
    "string",
    "by string",
    "I am a woman,",
    "no more",
    "and no less!"

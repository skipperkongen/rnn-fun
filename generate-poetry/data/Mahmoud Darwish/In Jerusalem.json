    "In Jerusalem, and I mean within the ancient walls,",
    "I walk from one epoch to another without a memory",
    "to guide me. The prophets over there are sharing",
    "the history of the holy ... ascending to heaven",
    "and returning less discouraged and melancholy, because love",
    "and peace are holy and are coming to town.",
    "I was walking down a slope and thinking to myself: How",
    "do the narrators disagree over what light said about a stone?",
    "Is it from a dimly lit stone that wars flare up?",
    "I walk in my sleep. I stare in my sleep. I see",
    "no one behind me. I see no one ahead of me.",
    "All this light is for me. I walk. I become lighter. I fly",
    "then I become another. Transfigured. Words",
    "sprout like grass from Isaiah\u2019s messenger",
    "mouth: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe you won\u2019t be safe.\u201d",
    "I walk as if I were another. And my wound a white",
    "biblical rose. And my hands like two doves",
    "on the cross hovering and carrying the earth.",
    "I don\u2019t walk, I fly, I become another,",
    "transfigured. No place and no time. So who am I?",
    "I am no I in ascension\u2019s presence. But I",
    "think to myself: Alone, the prophet Muhammad",
    "spoke classical Arabic. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d",
    "Then what? A woman soldier shouted:",
    "Is that you again? Didn\u2019t I kill you?",
    "I said: You killed me ... and I forgot, like you, to die."

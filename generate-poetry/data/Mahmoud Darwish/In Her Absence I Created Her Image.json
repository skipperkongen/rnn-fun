    "In her absence I created her image: out of the earthly",
    "the hidden heavenly commences. I am here weighing",
    "the expanse with the Jahili odes ... and absence",
    "is the guide, it is the guide. For each rhyme a tent",
    "is pitched. And for each thing blowing in the wind",
    "a rhyme. Absence teaches me its lesson: If it weren\u2019t",
    "for the mirage you wouldn\u2019t have been steadfast ...",
    "Then in the emptiness, I disassembled a letter from one",
    "of the ancient alphabets, and I leaned on absence. So who am I",
    "after the visitation? A bird, or a passerby amid the symbols",
    "and the memory vendors? As if I were an antique piece,",
    "as if I were a ghost sneaking in from Yabous, telling myself:",
    "Let\u2019s go to the seven hills. Then I placed",
    "my mask on a stone, and walked as the sleepless",
    "walk, led by my dream. And from one moon",
    "to another I leapt. There is enough of unconsciousness",
    "to liberate things from their history. And there",
    "is enough of history to liberate unconsciousness",
    "from its ascension. Take me to our early",
    "years\u2014my first girlfriend says. Leave",
    "the windows open for the house sparrow to enter",
    "your dream\u2014I say ... then I awaken, and no city is in",
    "the city. No \u201chere\u201d except \u201cthere.\u201d And no there",
    "but here. If it weren\u2019t for the mirage",
    "I wouldn\u2019t have walked to the seven hills ...",
    "if it weren\u2019t for the mirage!"

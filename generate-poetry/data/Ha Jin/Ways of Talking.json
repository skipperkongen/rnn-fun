    "We used to like talking about grief",
    "Our journals and letters were packed",
    "with losses, complaints, and sorrows.",
    "Even if there was no grief",
    "we wouldn\u2019t stop lamenting",
    "as though longing for the charm",
    "of a distressed face.",
    "Then we couldn\u2019t help expressing grief",
    "So many things descended without warning:",
    "labor wasted, loves lost, houses gone,",
    "marriages broken, friends estranged,",
    "ambitions worn away by immediate needs.",
    "Words lined up in our throats",
    "for a good whining.",
    "Grief seemed like an endless river\u2014",
    "the only immortal flow of life.",
    "After losing a land and then giving up a tongue,",
    "we stopped talking of grief",
    "Smiles began to brighten our faces.",
    "We laugh a lot, at our own mess.",
    "Things become beautiful,",
    "even hailstones in the strawberry fields."

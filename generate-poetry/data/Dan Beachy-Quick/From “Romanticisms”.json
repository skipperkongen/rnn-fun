    "Mortal oddment, there\u2019s no wish in the blood",
    "But beat, but stay gift-strong, but make demands",
    "To keep within veins this ore\u2019s diffuse gold,",
    "These voices that know without being known \u2014",
    "These voices that riddle thought with herself,",
    "Ridicule thought in her flimsy eternal",
    "Gowns a child can tear in half with a breath \u2014",
    "That chorus arterial, unbribable,",
    "Blowing song through self as a child blows",
    "A dandelion apart \u2014",
    "All those weeds? \u2014",
    "Thistle\u2019s down and thistle\u2019s thorn, dumb yellow",
    "Globes below that bind grass to their hollow creed,",
    "Wind\u2019s meager flute, sere song, the whole field\u2019s late",
    "Doom? Heart-blood? Voices, you? That\u2019s my portrait? \u2014",
    "I kept repeating, repeating, kept re \u2014",
    "To repair, to repair my, or not my \u2014",
    "Mind\u2019s bower, but whose \u2014 who mines urgency \u2014",
    "Or whose mind regrets all those violets rooted",
    "In violence \u2014 or I only mean thought, in thought,",
    "Not violence, thinking, and the stupid leaf",
    "Unfolding, mine, mine, mind. Here\u2019s the plot",
    "All untended: Psyche and, and \u2014 some thief",
    "Unnamed \u2014 no, some unnamed leaf, and the sun,",
    "Yes, only the sun that through open eyes",
    "Turns the livid leaf green. Not leaf. Meant wound \u2014",
    "Or is it wind, is it wind that split in half by",
    "A gnat, by a blade of grass, always heals its gale \u2014",
    "What is the wound that is being healed, healed \u2014"

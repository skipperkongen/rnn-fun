    "To make beauty out of pain, it damns the eyes\u2014",
    "No, dams the eyes. See how they overflow?",
    "No damns them, damns them, and so they cry.",
    "What shape can I swallow to make me whole?",
    "Baby\u2019s bird-shaped block, blue-painted wood",
    "That fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood box?",
    "The skeleton leaf? The skeleton key? Loud",
    "Knock when the shape won\u2019t unlock any locks.",
    "I hear it through the static in the baby\u2019s room",
    "When the monitor clicks on and off, sound",
    "Of sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocks,",
    "Laughing gull in the gale. What is it dives down",
    "Past sight, down there dark with the other blocks?",
    "It can\u2019t be seen, only heard. A kind of curse,",
    "This kind curse. Forgive me. Blessing that hurts."

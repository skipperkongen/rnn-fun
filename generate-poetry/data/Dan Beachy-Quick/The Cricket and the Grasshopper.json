    "The senseless leaf in the fevered hand",
    "Grows hot, near blood-heat, but never grows",
    "Green. Weeks ago the dove\u2019s last cooing strain",
    "Settled silent in the nest to brood slow",
    "Absence from song. The dropped leaf cools",
    "On the uncut grass, supple still, still green,",
    "Twining still these fingers as they listless pull",
    "The tangle straight until the tangle tightens",
    "And the hand is caught, another fallen leaf.",
    "The poetry of the earth never ceases",
    "Ceasing \u2014 one blade of grass denies belief",
    "Until its mere thread bears the grasshopper\u2019s",
    "Whole weight, and the black cricket sings unseen,",
    "Desire living in a hole beneath the tangle\u2019s green."

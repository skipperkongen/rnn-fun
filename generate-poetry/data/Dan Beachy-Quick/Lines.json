    "The lightning struck him and left a scar.",
    "The wind stopped blowing and the wheat stood up.",
    "Self-tensed self, who is this I that says I ?",
    "I had a scar in the shape of lightning",
    "That split in half when I opened my mouth.",
    "The sun just a circle of heat in the sky",
    "Throwing absence in the shape of clouds",
    "Down on the field. Another life placed",
    "In the middle of the life I called my own.",
    "A lesser god commanded the front: return.",
    "A little god knocked about in the germ.",
    "The third person put me outside my own sphere.",
    "A small god chanting lightning in the synapse.",
    "Wind blows the wheat down. He calls it prayer."

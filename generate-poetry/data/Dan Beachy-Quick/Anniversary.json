    "For yourself, chaos without demand",
    "To speak, the amethyst nothing",
    "Hidden inside the trinket shop\u2019s stone,",
    "Dark eyes dark asterisks where light",
    "Footnotes a margin left blank. You",
    "Don\u2019t look up to look up at the sky.",
    "Your ears parenthesize nothing",
    "That occurs, that I keep from occurring,",
    "In the poem, on the page, as you are",
    "For me, not a shadow, but a shade",
    "Whose darkness drops from no object",
    "But is itself yourself, a form of time",
    "Spanning nothing, never is your name."

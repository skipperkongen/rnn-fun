    "And at the picnic table under the ancient elms,",
    "one of my parents turned to me and said:",
    "\u201cWe hope you end up here,\u201d",
    "after my ether life: the ratio, in all dappling,",
    "of dark to bright; and yet how brief my stay would be",
    "under the trees, because the voice I\u2019d heard",
    "could not cradle me, could no longer keep me",
    "in greenery; and I would have to say good-bye",
    "again, make my way across the white",
    "California sand and back: or am I now creating",
    "the helplessness I heard those words express,",
    "the psalm torn like a map in my hands?"

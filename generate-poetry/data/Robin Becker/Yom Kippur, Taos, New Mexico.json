    "I\u2019ve expanded like the swollen door in summer",
    "to fit my own dimension. Your loneliness",
    "is a letter I read and put away, a daily reminder",
    "in the cry of the magpie that I am",
    "still capable of inflicting pain",
    "at this distance.",
    "Like a painting, our talk is dense with description,",
    "half-truths, landscapes, phrases layered",
    "with a patina over time. When she came into my life",
    "I didn\u2019t hesitate.",
    "Or is that only how it seems now, looking back?",
    "Or is that only how you accuse me, looking back?",
    "Long ago, this desert was an inland sea. In the mountains",
    "you can still find shells.",
    "It\u2019s these strange divagations I\u2019ve come to love: midday sun",
    "on pink escarpments; dusk on gray sandstone;",
    "toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot",
    "climb to",
    ", where the spirit",
    "of the dead hovers about its earthly home",
    "four days, before the prayer sticks drive it away.",
    "Today all good Jews collect their crimes like old clothes",
    "to be washed and given to the poor.",
    "I remember how my father held his father around the shoulders",
    "as they walked to the old synagogue in Philadelphia."

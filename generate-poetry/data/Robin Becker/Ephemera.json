    "The snake, alphabet of one glide, swims",
    "with its keepsake head, periscoping, and then",
    "we lose it in the pond grass, lashed",
    "among the bottom-feeders. Pocketing goggles,",
    "my gaze tends pineward, to the driest sky",
    "in twenty years (also passing, rain predicted),",
    "a month of sun days. In Fairbanks, all-night baseball",
    "and a picnic breakfast Alaskan-style. Someone\u2019s",
    "driving south, to Anchorage, in that luscious uplift",
    "that here will linger long enough for us",
    "to get a sunburn, to get down, to get stung,",
    "to get the hang of happiness and get going.",
    "Get the picture? I do, but just for the moment,",
    "which is why I want it monumental, equestrian,",
    "astride, however I can get it. What\u2019s",
    "passing is June, another; peony\u2019s scent; postcards",
    "from the lower forty-eight. The frog I trod sprang back",
    "intact, all its receptors set on July."

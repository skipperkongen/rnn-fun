    "If love is like a doll\u2019s shoe \u2014",
    "the color of nascent snow",
    "that laces over the ankle",
    "or the polychromatic beaded baby moccasins",
    "we saw lying in the museum drawer",
    "that belonged to an infant from a sea tribe of seal hunters.",
    "Or the rutilant pink blossoms",
    "of the locust tree that bloomed in the dark",
    "while I slept dreaming of my arrival",
    "on a red-eye wearing a long to the floor skirt \u2014",
    "not of a postulant, but of a flower vendor",
    "or a woman covering disfigurement.",
    "Freud believed that religious faith",
    "is a wish-fulfilling illusion.",
    "I can\u2019t locate faith in a carved or uncarved pew.",
    "I\u2019m more focused on the altar boy\u2019s shoes.",
    "Under his white robe he\u2019s wearing a man\u2019s black loafers",
    "vastly oversized for his small feet with",
    "sufficient spare space for a coyote den in each toe.",
    "I want to buy him a kite.",
    "If love is a mezzanine floor we will not fall from,",
    "a hand holding back my hair from my face",
    "as I\u2019m sick on the side of the bus.",
    "The mouth so at home in the vicinity of pavement.",
    "Pew also means to enclose, as in men who were",
    ".",
    "Freud also believed civilized life imposes suffering,",
    "yet he always wore a dinner jacket.",
    "We delaminate layers of old paint",
    "bleach sheets in the shade.",
    "I take out the oily ham from the beans,",
    "the unflattering photos from the folio,",
    "the quotes about repressed homosexuality",
    "being the reason Sigmund\u2019s patient Little Hans",
    "is afraid of horses."

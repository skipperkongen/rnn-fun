    "You dwell deep within\u2014",
    "you\u2019ve fixed the ends of creation.",
    "You stand, a tower for the near,",
    "refuge to those far off.",
    "You\u2019ve lain above the Ark, here,",
    "yet live in the highest heavens.",
    "Exalted among your hosts,",
    "although beyond their hymns\u2014",
    "no heavenly sphere",
    "could ever contain you,",
    "let alone a chamber within.",
    "In being borne above them",
    "on an exalted throne,",
    "you are closer to them",
    "than their breath and skin.",
    "Their mouths bear witness for them,",
    "that you alone gave them form.",
    "Your kingdom\u2019s burden is theirs;",
    "who wouldn\u2019t fear you?",
    "And who could fail",
    "to search for you\u2014",
    "who sends down food when it is due?",
    "I sought your nearness.",
    "With all my heart I called you.",
    "And in my going out to meet you,",
    "I found you coming toward me,",
    "as in the wonders of your might",
    "and holy works I saw you.",
    "Who would say he hasn\u2019t seen",
    "your glory as the heavens\u2019",
    "hordes declare",
    "their awe of you",
    "without a sound being heard?",
    "But could the Lord, in truth,",
    "dwell in men on earth?",
    "How would men you made",
    "from the dust and clay",
    "fathom your presence there,",
    "enthroned upon their praise?",
    "The creatures hovering over",
    "the world praise your wonders\u2014",
    "your throne borne high",
    "above their heads,",
    "as you bear all forever."

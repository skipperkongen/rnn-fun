    "At bedtime, my grandson\u2019s breath",
    "rasps in and out of fragile lungs.",

    "over his nose and mouth,",
    "I rock him on my lap and hum",
    "a lullaby to comfort him.",
    "The nebulizer hisses as steroids",
    "stream into his struggling chest,",
    "and suddenly he also starts to hum,",
    "his infant voice rising and falling",
    "on the same few notes\u2014some hymn",
    "he must have learned while in the womb",
    "or carried here from where he was before\u2014",
    "a kind of plainsong, holy and hypnotic",
    "in the dark."

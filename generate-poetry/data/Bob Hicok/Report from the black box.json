    "A cooler",
    "head of lettuce prevailed, but when the actor",
    "asked his question and paused",
    "for us to watch him pause and think",
    "inside the pause, I almost answered",
    "as if we were in a bar, just the two of us",
    "and a balcony and spotlight. The two of us",
    "and programs and makeup and a sofa",
    "from the director\u2019s living room and the black/",
    "womb/agora/s\u00e9ance of theater inviting us to feel",
    "together alone. I recall I don\u2019t recall",
    "the question but its scope on his face",
    "was immense, as if he were the Milky Way",
    "asking",
    "for long and my breath was the quiet yessing",
    "of tall grass against the shoulders of a cat",
    "stalking the night. I actually opened my mouth",
    "before I actually thought you will be stoned",
    "and not in the good way, not with stones",
    "of tongues, stones of fingers against my forehead",
    "but the play was messy and tangible and full",
    "of the etceteras I am full of and why",
    "wouldn\u2019t I want to talk with that is a question",
    "the poem is asking you to answer wherever",
    "you are without me is the problem",
    "theater solves, since we sit together",
    "in the dark with the dark because the dark",
    "deserves a face a soliloquy a lover a bow",
    "at the end. When I always wonder if the players",
    "regret that the lights come up and they see us",
    "as we are seeing them as they were,",
    "what a weird mirror that is, showing one side",
    "sudden appreciation and the resumption",
    "of loose ends, the other the vast",
    "and devotional possibilities of being kidnapped",
    "by a dream and which side is which side",
    "are you on?"

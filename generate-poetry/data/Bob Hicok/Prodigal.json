    "You could drive out of this country",
    "and attack the world with your ambition,",
    "invent wonder plasmas,",
    "become an artist of the provocative gesture,",
    "the suggestive nod, you could leave",
    "wanting the world and return",
    "carrying it, a noisy bundle",
    "of steam and libido, a ball of fire",
    "balanced on your tongue,",
    "you might reclaim Main Street in a limo",
    "longer than a sermon, wave at our red faces",
    "while remembering that you were born",
    "a clod hopper, a farmer\u2019s kid,",
    "and get over that hump once and for all",
    "by telling A Great Man\u2019s stories\u2014",
    "the dirty jokes of dictators, tidbits",
    "of presidential hygiene, insights",
    "into the psychotropic qualities of power",
    "and the American tradition of kissing",
    "moneyed ass. Your uncle would still",
    "call you Roy Boy, pheasants",
    "sun themselves beside the tracks,",
    "waiting for the dew to burn off",
    "before their first flight, and corn",
    "grow so high that if you stood",
    "in the field you\u2019d disappear, the fact",
    "aiming your eyes down the road."

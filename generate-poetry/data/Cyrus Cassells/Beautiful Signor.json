    "Whenever we wake,",
    "still joined, enraptured\u2014",
    "at the window,",
    "each clear night\u2019s finish",
    "the black pulse of dominoes",
    "dropping to land;",
    "whenever we embrace,",
    "haunted, upwelling,",
    "I know",
    "a reunion is taking place\u2014",
    "Hear me when I say",
    "our love\u2019s not meant to be",
    "an opiate;",
    "helpmate,",
    "you are the reachable mirror",
    "that dares me to risk",
    "the caravan back",
    "to the apogee, the longed-for",
    "arms of the Beloved\u2014",
    "dusks of jasmine,",
    "intimate beyond belief",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "no dread of nakedness",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "my long ship,",
    "my opulence,",
    "my garland",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "extinguishing the beggar\u2019s tin,",
    "the wind of longing",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "laving the ruined country,",
    "the heart wedded to war",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "the kiln-blaze",
    "in my body,",
    "the turning heaven",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "you cover me with pollen",
    "beautiful Signor",
    "into your sweet mouth\u2014",
    "This is the taproot:",
    "against all strictures,",
    "desecrations,",
    "I\u2019ll never renounce,",
    "never relinquish",
    "the first radiance, the first",
    "moment you took my hand\u2014",
    "This is the endless wanderlust:",
    "dervish,",
    "yours is the April-upon-April love",
    "that kept me spinning even beyond",
    "your eventful arms",
    "toward the unsurpassed:",
    "the one vast claiming heart,",
    "the glimmering,",
    "the beautiful and revealed Signor."

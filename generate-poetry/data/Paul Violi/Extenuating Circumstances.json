    "I don\u2019t know how fast I was going",
    "but, even so, that\u2019s still",
    "an intriguing question, officer,",

    "Particularly on a parkway as lovely",
    "as the one you\u2019re fortunate enough",
    "to patrol\u2014and patrol so diligently.",
    "A loveliness that, if observed",
    "at an appropriate rate of speed,",
    "affords the kind of pleasure",
    "which is in itself a reminder",
    "of how civilization depends",
    "on an assurance of order and measure,",

    "reignited above a snowfall\u2019s last",
    "flurry, cockeyed headlights scanning",
    "the girders overhead, eggshell",
    "snowcrust flying off the hood,",

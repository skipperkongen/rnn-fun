    "I don\u2019t like what the moon is supposed to do.",
    "Confuse me, ovulate me,",
    "spoon-feed me longing. A kind of ancient",
    "date-rape drug. So I\u2019ll howl at you, moon,",
    "I\u2019m angry. I\u2019ll take back the night. Using me to",
    "swoon at your questionable light,",
    "you had me chasing you,",
    "the world\u2019s worst lover, over and over",
    "hoping for a mirror, a whisper, insight.",
    "But you disappear for nights on end",
    "with all my erotic mysteries",
    "and my entire unconscious mind.",
    "How long do I try to get water from a stone?",
    "It\u2019s like having a bad boyfriend in a good band.",
    "Better off alone. I\u2019m going to write hard",
    "and fast into you, moon, face-fucking.",
    "Something you wouldn\u2019t understand.",
    "You with no swampy sexual",
    "promise but what we glue onto you.",
    "That\u2019s not real. You have no begging",
    "cunt. No panties ripped off and the crotch",
    "sucked. No lacerating spasms",
    "sending electrical sparks through the toes.",
    "Stars have those.",
    "What do you have? You\u2019re a tool, moon.",
    "Now, noon. There\u2019s a hero.",
    "The obvious sun, no bullshit, the enemy",
    "of poets and lovers, sleepers and creatures.",
    "But my lovers have never been able to read",
    "my mind. I\u2019ve had to learn to be direct.",
    "It\u2019s hard to learn that, hard to do.",
    "The sun is worth ten of you.",
    "You don\u2019t hold a candle",
    "to that complexity, that solid craze.",
    "Like an animal carcass on the road at night,",
    "picked at by crows,",
    "taunting walkers and drivers. Your face",
    "regularly sliced up by the moving",
    "frames of car windows. Your light is drawn,",
    "quartered, your dreams are stolen.",
    "You change shape and turn away,",
    "letting night solve all night\u2019s problems alone."

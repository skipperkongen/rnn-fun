    "There are two kinds of people, soldiers and women,",
    "as Virginia Woolf said. Both for decoration only.",
    "Now that is too kind. It\u2019s technical: virgins and wolves.",
    "We have choices now. Two little girls walk into a bar,",

    "comes over and says you won\u2019t be sorry. She\u2019s a fine",
    "piece of work but she don\u2019t come cheap. Myself, I\u2019m",
    "in less fear of predators than of walking around",
    "in my mother\u2019s body. That\u2019s sneaky, that\u2019s more",
    "than naked. Let\u2019s even it up: you go on fuming in your",

    "Ascetic or carnivore. Men will crack your glaze",
    "even if you leave them before morning. Pigs",
    "ride the sirens in packs. Ah, flesh, technoflesh,",
    "there are two kinds of people. Hot with mixed",
    "light, drunk on insult. You and me."

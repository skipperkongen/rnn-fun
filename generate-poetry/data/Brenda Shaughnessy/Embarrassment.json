    "On the subject of our names.",
    "They\u2019re so embracing,",
    "thinking they\u2019re all us",
    "and swallowing themselves",
    "into our nausea.",
    "Yet we never quite die on the spot.",
    "We put off being what we\u2019re called,",
    "we take the hint.",
    "Time is never wasted.",
    "It is always spent.",

    "And the mirror multiplies inside.",
    "The world is no bigger, but next time",

    "4. The Principle of the Borg",
    "Saying \u201cThere\u2019s no one like me\u201d",
    "accomplishes the exact opposite",
    "of what you mean.",

    "for everyone equally.",
    "So it means you are not special",
    "in any way. Which should be enough for you.",
    "5. Documentary",
    "This clothing, a maladaptive wrapping,",
    "cuts me up. I am a vignette,",
    "floated knowingly",
    "since I pulled myself through myself,",
    "like a unitard. Too many eyeholes",

    "Even the clumsiest fate is perfectly shaped,",
    "so the view took over looking",
    "but the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever known",

    "sugar rotted down to its truth.",
    "Loving you a serious accidental shame",
    "and day flatulates into night,",
    "trips and falls in front of millions",
    "into morning.",
    "In thrall to this pocus:",
    "the end of fear starts",
    "with such an annihilating blush,",
    "with such a stutter."

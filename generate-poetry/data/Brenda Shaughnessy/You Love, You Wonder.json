    "You love a woman and you wonder where she goes all night in some tricked-",
    "out taxicab, with her high heels and her corset and her big, fat mouth.",
    "You love how she only wears her glasses with you, how thick",
    "and cow-eyed she swears it\u2019s only ever you she wants to see.",
    "You love her, you want her very ugly. If she is lovely big, you want her",
    "scrawny. If she is perfect lithe, you want her ballooned, a cosmonaut.",
    "How not to love her, her bouillabaisse, her orangina. When you took her",
    "to the doctor the doctor said, \u201cWow, look at that!\u201d and you were proud,",
    "you asshole, you love and that\u2019s how you are in love. Any expert, observing",
    "human bodies, can see how she\u2019s exceptional, how she ruins us all.",
    "But you really love this woman, how come no one can see this? Everyone must",
    "become suddenly very clumsy at recognizing beauty if you are to keep her.",
    "You don\u2019t want to lose anything, at all, ever. You want her sex depilated, you",
    "want everyone else not blind, but perhaps paralyzed, from the eyes down.",
    "You wonder where she goes all night. If she leaves you, you will know",
    "everything about love. If she\u2019s leaving you now, you already know it."

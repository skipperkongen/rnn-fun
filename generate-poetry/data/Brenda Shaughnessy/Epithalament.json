    "Other weddings are so shrewd on the sofa, short",
    "and baffled, bassett-legged. All things",
    "knuckled, I have no winter left, in my sore rememory,",
    "to melt down for drinking water. Shrunk down.",
    "Your wedding slides the way wiry dark hairs do, down",
    "a swimming pool drain. So I am drained.",
    "Sincerely. I wish you every chapped bird on this",
    "pilgrimage to hold your hem up from the dust.",
    "Dust is plural: infinite dust. I will sink in the sun,",
    "I will crawl towards the heavy drawing",
    "and design the curtains in the room",
    "of never marrying you. Because it is a sinking,",
    "because today\u2019s perfect weather is a later life\u2019s",
    "smut. This soiled future unplans love.",
    "I keep unplanning the same Sunday. Leg",
    "and flower, breeze and terrier, I have no garden",
    "and couldn\u2019t be happier. Please, don\u2019t lose me",
    "here. I am sorry my clutch is all",
    "tendon and no discipline: the heart is a severed",
    "kind of muscle and alone.",
    "I can hear yours in your room. I hear mine",
    "in another room. In another\u2019s."

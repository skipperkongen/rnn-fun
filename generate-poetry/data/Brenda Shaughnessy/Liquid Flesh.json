    "In a light chocolatine room",
    "with blackout windows,",
    "a loud clock drowns in soft dawn\u2019s",
    "syllables, crisscrossed",
    "with a broken cloudiness",
    "I\u2019d choose as my own bedcovers",
    "but cannot. My choice of sleep",
    "or sky has no music of its own.",
    "There\u2019s no \u201cits own\u201d while the baby cries.",
    "Oh, the baby cries. He howls and claws",
    "like a wrongly minor red wolf",
    "who doesn\u2019t know his mother.",
    "I know I am his mother, but I can\u2019t",
    "quite click on the word\u2019s essential aspects,",
    "can\u2019t denude the flora",
    "or disrobe the kind of housecoat",
    "\u201cmother\u201d always is. Something",
    "cunty, something used.",
    "Whatever meaning the word itself",
    "is covering, like underwear,",
    "that meaning is so mere and meager",
    "this morning. Mother. Baby.",
    "Chicken and egg. It\u2019s so obnoxious",
    "of me: I was an egg",
    "who had an egg",
    "and now I\u2019m a chicken,",
    "as usual scooping up",
    "both possibilities,",
    "or what I used to call",
    "possibilities. I used",
    "to be this way, so ontologically",
    "greedy, wanting to be it all.",
    "Serves me right.",
    "My belief in the fluidity",
    "of the self turns out to mean",
    "my me is a flow of wellwater,",
    "without the well, or the bucket,",
    "a hole dug and seeping.",
    "A kind of unwell, where",
    "the ground reabsorbs",
    "what it was displaced to give.",
    "The drain gives meaning to the sieve.",
    "As I said: a chicken who still",
    "wants to be all potential.",
    "Someone who springs",
    "and falls, who cannot see",
    "how many of us I have",
    "in me\u2014and I do not like them all.",
    "Do I like us? Can I love us?",
    "If anyone comes",
    "first it\u2019s him, but how can that be?",
    "I was here way, way first.",
    "I have the breasts, godawful, and he",
    "the lungs and we share the despair.",
    "For we are a we, aren\u2019t we? We split",
    "a self in such a way that there isn\u2019t",
    "enough for either of us.",
    "The father of the baby is sleepy",
    "and present in his way, in the way",
    "of fathers. He is devoted like",
    "few fathers, and maybe hurts",
    "like I hurt, like no fathers.",
    "I don\u2019t know what someone else",
    "feels, not even these someones",
    "who are also me. Do they hurt",
    "like I do? Why can\u2019t they",
    "tell me, or morse or sign: let",
    "me know they know where and how",
    "and why it hurts? Or something?",
    "What is the point of other people,",
    "being so separate, if we can\u2019t",
    "help a person get that pain",
    "will stick its shiv into anything,",
    "just to get rid of the weapon",
    "and because it can? For if we share",
    "ourselves then they, too, must",
    "also be in so much pain.",
    "I can hear it. Oh, my loves.",
    "The wood of the crib, the white",
    "glow of the milk (which must",
    "have siphoned off the one",
    "and only pure part of me, leaving",
    "me with what, toxicity",
    "or sin or mush?), the awful softness.",
    "I\u2019ve been melted into something",
    "too easy to spill. I make more",
    "and more of myself in order",
    "to make more and more of the baby.",
    "He takes it, this making. And somehow",
    "he\u2019s made more of me, too.",
    "I\u2019m a mother now.",
    "I run to the bathroom, run",
    "to the kitchen, run to the crib",
    "and I\u2019m not even running.",
    "These places just scare up as needed,",
    "the wires that move my hands",
    "to the sink, to the baby,",
    "to the breast are electrical.",
    "I\u2019m in shock.",
    "One must be in shock to say so,",
    "as if one\u2019s own state is assessable,",
    "like a car accident or Minnesota taxes.",
    "A total disaster, this sack of liquid",
    "flesh which yowls and leaks",
    "and I\u2019m talking about me",
    "not the baby. Me, this puddle",
    "of a middle, this utilized vessel,",
    "cracked hull, divine",
    "design. It\u2019s how it works. It\u2019s how",
    "we all got here. Deform",
    "following the function . . .",
    "I whisper",
    "secretly and to think,",
    "around these parts used to be",
    "the joyful place of sex,",
    "what is now this intimate",
    "terror and squalor.",
    "My eyes burned out at three a.m. and again",
    "at six and eleven. This is why the clock",
    "is drowning, as I said earlier.",
    "I\u2019m trying to explain it.",
    "I repeat myself, or haven\u2019t I already?",
    "Tiny self, along with a tiny self.",
    "I\u2019ll say it: he hurt me, this new",
    "babe, then and now.",
    "Perhaps he always will,",
    "though thoughts of the future",
    "seem like science fiction novels",
    "I never finished reading.",
    "Their ends like red nerves",
    "chopped off by cleaver, not aliens,",
    "this very moment, saving nothing for later.",
    "He howls with such fury and clarity",
    "I must believe him.",
    "No god has the power",
    "to make me believe anything,",
    "yet I happen to know",
    "this baby knows a way out.",
    "This dark hole closing in on me",
    "all around: he\u2019ll show me",
    "how to get through",
    "the shock and the godlessness",
    "and the rictus of crushed flesh,",
    "into the rest of my life."

    "When you show yourself to the woman",
    "you love, you don\u2019t know your fear",
    "is not fear, itself. You have never been good,",
    "but now you are so good,",
    "who are you? Is it the liquidity of her skin",
    "that bathes the world for you,",
    "or her face, captured like a she-lion",
    "in your own flesh?",
    "This summerbed is soft with ring upon ring",
    "upon ring of wedding, the kind",
    "that doesn\u2019t clink upon contact, the kind",
    "with no contract,",
    "the kind in which the gold is only (only!) light.",
    "Cloud covers and lifts,",
    "and sleep and night and soon enough, love\u2019s",
    "big fire laughs at a terrible burn,",
    "but only (only!) because pain absorbs excess",
    "joy and you shouldn\u2019t flaunt",
    "your treasures in front of all day\u2019s eyes."

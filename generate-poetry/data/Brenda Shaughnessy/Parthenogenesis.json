    "It\u2019s easy to make more of myself by eating,",
    "and sometimes easy\u2019s the thing.",
    "To be double-me, half the trouble",
    "but not lonely.",
    "Making cakes to celebrate any old day.",
    "Eating too much: the emperor of being used.",
    "Nature, mature and feminized,",
    "naturalizes me naturally by creating",
    "the feeling of being a natural woman,",
    "like a sixteen-year-old getting knocked up",
    "again. To solve that problem,",
    "there\u2019s the crispness of not eating,",
    "a pane of glass with a bloody-edged",
    "body, that is, having the baby at the prom",
    "undetected and, in a trance of self-preservation,",
    "throwing it away in the girls\u2019 room trash.",
    "Buried under paper towels, silent.",
    "Nothing could be better, for the teenager.",
    "For me, starving, that coreless, useful feeling,",
    "is not making myself smaller",
    "but making myself bigger, inside.",
    "It\u2019s prince and pauper both, it\u2019s starving artist",
    "and good model in one masterpiece.",
    "It rhymes with",
    "and that\u2019s no accident.",
    "Fullness is dullness. Dreaming\u2019s too easy.",
    "But sometimes I don\u2019t care.",
    "Sometimes I put in just the right amount,",
    "but then I\u2019m the worst kinds of patsy, a chump",
    "giving myself over to myself like a criminal",
    "to the law, with nothing to show for it.",
    "No reward, no news, no truth.",
    "It\u2019s too sad to be so ordinary every day.",
    "Like some kind of employee.",
    "Being told what to do. Chop off a finger",
    "to plant in fertilizer (that is, in used animal",
    "food), to grow a finger tree.",
    "More fingers for me. Stop saying",
    ".",
    "I\u2019m the one in charge here.",
    "Stop the madness and just eat the mirror.",
    "Put it in sideways or crush it",
    "into a powder. It doesn\u2019t hurt and it works.",
    "Mouth full, don\u2019t talk.",
    "Nothing to say. I\u2019ll be a whole new person.",
    "I\u2019ll make her myself. Then we\u2019ll walk away.",
    "We\u2019ll say to each other how she\u2019s changed.",
    "How we wouldn\u2019t have recognized us."

    "Now that I\u2019m fifty, let me take my showers",
    "at night, no light, eyes closed. And let me swim",
    "in cover-ups. My skin\u2019s tattooed with hours",
    "and days and decades, head to foot, and slim",
    "is just a faded photograph. It\u2019s strange",
    "how people look away who once would look.",
    "I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d undergo this change",
    "and be the unseen cover of a book",
    "whose plot, though swift, just keeps on getting thicker.",
    "One reaches for the pleasures of the mind",
    "and heart to counteract the loss of quicker",
    "knowledge. One feels old urgencies unwind,",
    "although I still pluck chin hairs with a tweezer,",
    "in case I might attract another geezer."

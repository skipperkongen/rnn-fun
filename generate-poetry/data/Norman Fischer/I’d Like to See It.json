    "A compendium of words was stored here",
    "Just underneath the chimney",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "Fortune won\u2019t stand still for that",
    "And pressure of the air flattens paper",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "One comes into the room groomed, a pleasure",
    "There\u2019s a patch of glitter in the glamor",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "Each moment opens up sudden as an umbrella",
    "On a day storms gather like wool",
    "A way I\u2019d really like to see it",
    "So you can\u2019t assume a face again",
    "Before the non-face puts in its appearance",
    "Nor can you push at the door expecting satisfaction on the other side",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "Many\u2019s the time and time for reflection",
    "Truer than truth the subject\u2019s interconnections",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "I was born on a day absolutely unique in world history",
    "Birds grasp their path in air",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "It\u2019s standard to pack half a dozen at a clip",
    "Imagine the red thing yours alone at last",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "The image almost takes shape superimposed",
    "As a mist on top of ordinary daily objects",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "Life goes on forever like a dusty road",
    "Down which we peer as we drink a glass of water",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "We return again and again born into wombs",
    "The shape of inverted ice cream cones",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "So I could relax, put on my enormous suit",
    "And ring your doorbell holding my breath and flowers",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "In order to be able to end war but",
    "Would war ever end or would my wanting",
    "To end it ever end if nothing ever ended",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "Everything is standing up and falling down again",
    "Constantly like hair in wind",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "For the good of the nation behind bars",
    "For my own good bundled up into piles",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "I blow continuously on this thing the landscape",
    "Crumples around me like a felt hat",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way",
    "But the problem is I put out my hand",
    "And only clutch air wanting to understand",
    "I\u2019d like to see it some way",
    "Any way so long as I could know it was there",
    "And could pull back the covers at will",
    "To reveal my heart\u2019s desire and measure it",
    "I\u2019d like to see it that way"

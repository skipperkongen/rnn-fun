    "So I would hear out those lungs,",
    "The air split into nine levels,",
    "Some gift of tongues of the whistler",
    "In the invalid\u2019s bed: my mother,",
    "Warbling all day to herself",
    "The thousand variations of one song;",
    "It is called Buckdancer\u2019s Choice.",
    "For years, they have all been dying",
    "Out, the classic buck-and-wing men",
    "Of traveling minstrel shows;",
    "With them also an old woman",
    "Was dying of breathless angina,",
    "Yet still found breath enough",
    "To whistle up in my head",
    "A sight like a one-man band,",
    "Freed black, with cymbals at heel,",
    "An ex-slave who thrivingly danced",
    "To the ring of his own clashing light",
    "Through the thousand variations of one song",
    "All day to my mother\u2019s prone music,",
    "The invalid\u2019s warbler\u2019s note,",
    "While I crept close to the wall",
    "Sock-footed, to hear the sounds alter,",
    "Her tongue like a mockingbird\u2019s break",
    "Through stratum after stratum of a tone",
    "Proclaiming what choices there are",
    "For the last dancers of their kind,",
    "For ill women and for all slaves",
    "Of death, and children enchanted at walls",
    "With a brass-beating glow underfoot,",
    "Not dancing but nearly risen",
    "Through barnlike, theatrelike houses",
    "On the wings of the buck and wing."

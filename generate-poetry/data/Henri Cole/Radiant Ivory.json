    "After the death of my father, I locked",
    "myself in my room, bored and animal-like.",
    "The travel clock, the Johnnie Walker bottle,",
    "the parrot tulips\u2014everything possessed his face,",
    "chaste and obscure. Snow and rain battered the air",
    "white, insane, slathery. Nothing poured",
    "out of me except sensibility, dilated.",
    "It was as if I were",
    "-born\u2014preverbal,",
    "truculent, pure\u2014with hard ivory arms",
    "reaching out into a dark and crowded space,",
    "illuminated like a perforated silver box",
    "or a little room in which glowing cigarettes",
    "came and went, like souls losing magnitude,",
    "but none with the battered hand I knew."

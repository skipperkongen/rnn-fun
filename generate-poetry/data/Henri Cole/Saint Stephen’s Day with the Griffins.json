    "Half-eagle, half-lion, the fabulous",
    "animal struts, saber-clawed but saintly,",
    "a candlewicked ornament dangling",
    "from our rickety sugar pine. Butternut",
    "pudding in our bellies. His reindeer",
    "and sleigh hurried here and gone\u2014thank God",
    "for us childless folks. Almost: the lovelocked",
    "Griffins on the sofa, sockfooted, hearing",
    "gas and a kiddy heart in her tummy\u2014",
    "a life more imaginary than real,",
    "though one is dazzled by gold that fills",
    "the egg unbroken. We feed her crumpets",
    "and listen again: The lamb\u2019s a hungry",
    "bugger, even snug from earth\u2019s",
    "imponderable fury. Tomorrow, in a spurt",
    "by jet I\u2019m home. Clumsy as a puppy",
    "I\u2019ll scale the flightstairs into the nosecone,",
    "luggage banging at my sides, enter the egg-",
    "shaped cabin and await the infrared",
    "climb toward space. Tell me one",
    "thing true? If I could count the way",
    "things slip from us: Mother\u2019s fur gloves,",
    "Sunday\u2019s benediction, the dead gone before us,",
    "love\u2019s rambler on the prairie\u2014all displaced",
    "as we buckle in our shuttle,",
    "jetbound on a screaming runway,",
    "gravity pulling at us castaways,",
    "more mammal than bird, subtle",
    "leg-weary griffins made manifest,",
    "arrowing towards home. How do we",
    "ignore it: the attenuated being",
    "of our age, the bittersweet collapse",
    "of dominoes mooned around our pine?",
    "Withered with hatred from his quarter,",
    "Saint Stephen even at death rolled mercifully over",
    "in high holiness. Sonless, wifeless, nine",
    "thousand feet from land, I roll the lozenge",
    "on my tongue, youthful habit for ache",
    "of any kind, parting a survivor (Wait!),",
    "love rescuing me from the fringe."

    "The worst for him was his friend turned wolf,",
    "and the blood that splattered as he ran. The worst",
    "for us: the hospital, his upper lip tugged back",
    "to show the gash\u2014the flesh halved deeply,",
    "cleanly\u2014while I hold him for the needle",
    "that rubs pain out. He submits",
    "to the quick stitch, the thread black",
    "against pink skin, calm now he sees",
    "the doctor can be trusted, his voice",
    "soothing, his face clean shaven,",
    "the clues that signal kindness to a child.",
    "He\u2019s worried, though, about his pet",
    "who",
    "His voice is flat.",
    "He knows the months he\u2019s tried to woo this dog",
    "were over when it leapt for his throat",
    "and caught his mouth. The scars, at least,",
    "will be invisible. At home, he\u2019ll sleep,",
    "big boy between his parents, till he\u2019s sure",
    "no beast will tear into his dreams. And we",
    "will want him there, our bodies makeshift walls.",
    "We who led the stranger to our home,",
    "fixed him a bowl, taught him to sleep",
    "under our blankets, we who taught our son",
    "to rub the muzzle that sheathes the teeth."

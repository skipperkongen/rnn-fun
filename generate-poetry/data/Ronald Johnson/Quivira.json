    "to Coronado, meant \u2018buffalo\u2019",
    "to the Indians, but onward, to El Dorado, \u2018The Gilded One\u2019,",
    "a country where",
    "boats were incrusted with gold, where",
    "golden bells hung from trees",
    "(tho the food there,",
    "said to be served on gold,",
    "was buffalo).",
    "\u2018We took the hump from both sides of the hump ribs, of all the carcasses. In taking out the hump we inserted the knife at the coupling of the loin, cutting forward down the lower side, as far forward as the perpendicular ribs ran; then, starting at the loin again, would cut down the upper side, thus taking out a strip from a full-grown animal about three feet long. Near the front of the hump ribs it would be ten or twelve inches wide & four or five inches thick. When first taken out it was hung up for a couple of days with the big end down. It became shrunken, tender & brittle, with no taint. The front end had a streak of lean alternating with fat & when fried in tallow, made a feast for the gods\u2019.",
    "The prairie soil was \u2018black & fat\u2019 &,",
    "according to Castaneda, the marrow of the land.",
    "On that soil, later to be stripped",

    "bitter",
    "with china-berries.",
    "The coyotes,",
    "their eyes aglow on the dark horizon, barked at a moon",
    "above the lowing",
    "of buffalo, heard twenty miles",
    "away.",
    "And cottonwood trees, from whose buds",
    "the Indians",
    "made clear yellow, scattered their drift in spring",
    "filling the gullies.",

    "were to tell Coranado",

    "As Coronado turned to retrace his steps,",
    "the Smoky Hills were visible north across a stream",

    "the Indians had said, \u2018of great",
    "importance\u2019.",
    "The country they traveled over",
    "was so level,",
    "if one looked at the buffalo",
    "the sky could be seen between their legs,",
    "so that at a distance they appeared",
    "to be smooth-trunked pines whose tops jointed\u2014",
    "& if there was",
    "one bull, it seemed four",
    "pines.",

    "sight",
    "of the ground.",
    "Did Coronado see also in that late summer storm,",
    "before he turned south,",
    "an horizon of dark funnels tapering",
    "toward the earth, coming with the thunderous sound of a buffalo herd",
    "out of the plains\u2014a calm & sulphurous air",
    "in which clouds were drawn like lightning toward the funnels\u2014",
    "scattering his men",
    "to hide among grassy hollows?",
    "A tornado against the sky",
    "like buffalo",

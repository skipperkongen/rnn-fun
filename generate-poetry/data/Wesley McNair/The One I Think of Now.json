    "At the end of my stepfather\u2019s life",
    "when his anger was gone,",
    "and the saplings of his failed",
    "nursery had grown into trees,",
    "my newly feminist mother had him",

    "she would say as he looked",
    "for a knife to cut the cheese",
    "and a tray to serve it with,",

    "as a girl. He is the one I think of now,",
    "lifting the tray for my family,",
    "the guests, until at last he comes",
    "to me. And I, no less confused,",

    "and not this bafflement, these",
    "almost tender hands that once",
    "swung hammers and drove machines",
    "and insisted that I learn to be a man."

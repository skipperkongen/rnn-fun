    "How were we to know, leaving your two kids",
    "behind in New Hampshire for our honeymoon",
    "at twenty-one, that it was a trick of cheap",
    "hotels in New York City to draw customers",
    "like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby?",
    "Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found",
    "a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door",
    "with a cut on one side the exact shape",
    "of the toilet bowl that was in its way",
    "when I closed it. I opened and shut the door,",
    "admiring the fit and despairing of it. You",
    "discovered the initials of lovers carved",
    "on the bureau\u2019s top in a zigzag, breaking heart.",
    "How wrong the place was to us then,",
    "unable to see the portents of our future",
    "that seem so clear now in the naivete\u0301",
    "of the arrangements we made, the hotel\u2019s",
    "disdain for those with little money,",
    "the carving of pain and love. Yet in that room",
    "we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay",
    "our love down, and in this way began our unwise",
    "and persistent and lucky life together."

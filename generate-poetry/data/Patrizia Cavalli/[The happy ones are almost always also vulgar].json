    "The happy ones are almost always also vulgar;",
    "happiness has a way of thinking",
    "that's rushed and has no time to look",
    "but keeps on moving, compact and manic,",
    "with contempt in passing for the dying:",
    "Get on with your life, come on, buck up!",
    "Those stilled by pain don't mix",
    "with the cheerful, self-assured runners",
    "but with those who walk at the same slow pace.",
    "If one wheel locks and the other's turning",
    "the turning one doesn't stop turning",
    "but goes as far as it can, dragging the other",
    "in a poor, skewed race until the cart",
    "either comes to a halt or falls apart."

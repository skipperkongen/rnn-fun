    "The Goddess who created this passing world",
    "Said Let there be lightbulbs & liquefaction",
    "Life spilled out onto the street, colors whirled",
    "Cars & the variously shod feet were born",
    "And the past & future & I born too",
    "Light as airmail paper away she flew",
    "To Annapurna or Mt. McKinley",
    "Or both but instantly",
    "Clarified, composed, forever was I",
    "Meant by her to recognize a painting",
    "As beautiful or a movie stunning",
    "And to adore the finitude of words",
    "And understand as surfaces my dreams",
    "Know the eye the organ of affection",
    "And depths to be inflections",
    "Of her voice & wrist & smile"

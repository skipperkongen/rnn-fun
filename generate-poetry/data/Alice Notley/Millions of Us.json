    "Purportedly a chain of civilians, soldiers, voices",
    "lice they were called. It is sometimes sufficient to beg",
    "Lice creeping over one, kill them with a chemical;",

    "Walked over the scorch; what are values when there\u2019s nothing here?",
    "The wing of a dead soul grows into all the lace you see through,",
    "foreigner, lice-ridden article of divestment. Splendid vices",
    "pouring outcomes over the eager cash flow promotions.",
    "So many of the dead came to me that their transparencies",
    "covered my visage, I\u2019m too near you. Don\u2019t you want to",
    "We came from faraway camps, forsaking the human because it",
    "broke our bodies into pieces for the torturer\u2019s pet, who",
    "propositions you. There is always a slant on it. The trees",
    "go down; or light affects your eyes badly. We pleaded for an",
    "adjustment, before we\u2019d recognizably died. You",
    "told me you were a heart, but you were guarding a tower. You",
    "said you were a failure, but you helped destroy us.",
    "Wings all over me, stuck to my skin, there\u2019s no point to it",
    "why are you here when there\u2019s nothing? We just don\u2019t believe it.",
    "my name is irretrievable. No one letting you go because you",
    "are prized for not existing except as a body, now not.",
    "No I don\u2019t exist, alighting and ghoulishly begging you for a",
    "drop of your blood, a morsel of your flesh. Yes take some of",
    "me, though there are so many others with flesh. But they\u2019re too",
    "rich to give. I know they will never let you in, you beautiful",
    "kids who haunt the corridors extending through",
    "the invisible world, so you can find your way. So you can see",
    "past the smoke of disastrous fear acting out of dreams:",
    "it creeps everywhere. See how it took them over, for",
    "they had no mind to stand against any fantasy the instigators",
    "chose. Had no minds at all. When I was little, no one told",
    "me I\u2019d have to suffer. Who can be a child? And the ghoul",
    "patiently explains how the wing of a word can extend till the",
    "barrier is made, so they can\u2019t see us. If you say",
    "that",
    "will be ignored, and we can hide. It was his name a long time ago,",
    "before the auctions began. Her face then was large and younger.",
    "She can be lice or ghoul. I want that, I don\u2019t want action. But I",
    "will have to live off bits of you."

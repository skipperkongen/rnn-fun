    "An early sadness for the future",
    "(as in dreams of myself young and sad)",
    "accompanies my departure towards",
    "a conventional story: a town",
    "of girls a New York City dormitory.",
    "And so a trail proceeds from",
    "our house on the top of the hill",
    "down the back way of former army barracks",
    "and past the borrowed church (ours had no tank)",
    "where I was baptized",
    "reasoning \u201cit must be true\u201d out of",
    "the love I had for my mother.",
    "And Tony\u2019s house there across the street from it",
    "absolutely in the Mexican gully",
    "in dreams of which he and I still fight armed enemies",
    "he stepped on a land mine in Nam",
    "when I remind my brother, twenty years after",
    "his face contorts he knows the look of that death",
    "a week before he himself dies",
    "blood-tinged ruddy-winged, but that\u2019s another",
    "dream-site the Needles Cemetery inelegant",
    "unbeautiful and dear and dry.",
    "See how many loves, how much thus sadness",
    "in the future begins to",
    "haunt that walk down that hill",
    "towards the highway away to the dormitory",
    "as I go to New York to sever love\u2019s connections",
    "and make the \u201creal ones\u201d generated by",
    "actual mating by beauty and clothes",
    "the black wool suit with its three button jacket",
    "the oddly puffed-sleeved orange sweater",
    "and an orange and midnight-",
    "blue paisley waistless dress.",
    "New trail there,",
    "Brett knows my future love though I don\u2019t",
    "hitchhikes with him to California",
    "years before I catch up to the poets in Iowa City",
    "that will be in \u201969, my brother",
    "hasn\u2019t yet signed up for Nam then",
    "when he gives me rattles off a rattler",
    "which I keep in my wooden India box I still have",
    "until they stink.",
    "I can\u2019t keep track of the track there\u2019s nothing but",
    "sidetrails of love and sadness so love is",
    "all that makes my people act they go to war for love",
    "you know, of who and what you are",
    "like I was baptized by",
    "the cruellest-lipped prissiest-mouthed man in the world",
    "for love, but I could just have gone swimming",
    "walked back up love\u2019s hill",
    "back up at the house you can get to the pool",
    "barefoot if you can find enough",
    "bush or telephone-pole shadows.",
    "We\u2019d all swim together",
    "I\u2019d tread water dreaming of the future",
    "but a wilder larger eye birdlike",
    "distant holds the pool in its pupil",
    "anyone\u2019s that too, and hold the enlarging",
    "water sad how not be",
    "why don\u2019t the smart girls in New York know this",
    "why don\u2019t you or I know what we know",
    "the eye and the water both enlarge still why don\u2019t",
    "smart girls in Paris, yes larger but will never flood",
    "the containing eye, but why not",
    "and sometimes it does",
    "when you or your own are the news."

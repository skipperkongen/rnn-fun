    "At a bus stop in Arles a fellow wounded in the Last War",
    "winced into sunlight:",
    "les juifs again, and the Moors. France is an old man!",
    "An old pink thing lacking one eye, with his good one he gazed",
    "through and past me to something which held his interest",
    "and at which, after a silence not uncomfortable, he smiled.",
    "Were I to tell this to acquaintances they would brand him senile.",
    "Below a ridge in the Dr\u00f4me, a goatherd huddled in mists.",
    "His little carboniferous eyes glinted. He was not clean.",
    "A kid bucked and sprang. I asked him how long a goat lives.",
    "He stared, shrugged, and up the slope of wonder intoned,",
    "I asked how many in his herd, and discussed income.",
    "I started to turn over figures in my alien mind, doing",
    "sums and multiples on his eighty head, with calvings pyramiding",
    "upward through geometric promise. He watched me.",
    "He knew what I was thinking, and what I was going to propose.",
    ", he chuckled,",
    "And were I to relate this t0 the literati, they\u2019d call it anecdote."

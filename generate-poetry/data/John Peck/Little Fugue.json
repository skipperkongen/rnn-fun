    "An apple paring",
    "curled from the knife wetly",
    "down my thumb\u2014",
    "and what I had failed",
    "to do rightly touching that life",
    "next to mine, wearing",
    "late afternoon\u2019s numb",
    "luminosity, impaled me.",
    "A hunter knee-deep",
    "in salt marsh, whom Anton Chekov",
    "might have set there and then left,",
    "back to doctoring,",
    "or choked off as too dark, wanton,",
    "met the steep",
    "flailing of teal, trailed their shrill lift,",
    "but stood only, hearing them.",
    "Pouring the last tea",
    "of an evening, dark amber",
    "alive, breathing in quintessence",
    "of India,",
    "I felt limber bark",
    "sheathing the shrub of my life\u2019s tree",
    "with root good, but dense,",
    "dark, local, raw there,",
    "and so in dark woke,",
    "the seeing doctor, two simple",
    "profiles of linked characters",
    "in his air,",
    "cruel, good, a pair ample, true",
    "across that split yoke,",
    "true to its splayed force\u2014",
    "simple so rare, though."

    "We, the Fairies, blithe and antic,",
    "Of dimensions not gigantic,",
    "Though the moonshine mostly keep us,",

    "Stolen sweets are always sweeter,",
    "Stolen kisses much completer,",
    "Stolen looks are nice in chapels,",
    "Stolen, stolen, be your apples.",
    "When to bed the world are bobbing,",
    "Then's the time for orchard-robbing;",
    "Yet the fruit were scarce worth peeling,",
    "Were it not for stealing, stealing."

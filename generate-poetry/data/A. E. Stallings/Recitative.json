    "Every night, we couldn\u2019t sleep.",
    "Our upstairs neighbors had to keep",
    "Dropping something down the hall\u2014",
    "A barbell or a bowling ball,",
    "And from the window by the bed,",
    "Echoing inside my head,",
    "Alley cats expended breath",
    "In arias of love and death.",
    "Dawn again, across the street,",
    "Jackhammers began to beat",
    "Like hangovers, and you would frown\u2014",
    "Noon, the radiator grill",
    "Groaned, gave off a lesser chill",
    "So that we could take off our coats.",
    "The pipes coughed to clear their throats.",
    "Our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves,",
    "We cherished each our minor griefs",
    "To keep them warm until the night,",
    "When it was time again to fight;",
    "But we were young, did not need much",
    "To make us laugh instead, and touch,",
    "And could not hear ourselves above",
    "The arias of death and love."

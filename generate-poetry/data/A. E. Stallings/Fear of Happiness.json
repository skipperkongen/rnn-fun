    "Looking back, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always had:",
    "As a kid, it was a glass-floored elevator",
    "I crouched at the bottom of, my eyes squinched tight,",
    "Or staircase whose gaps I was afraid I\u2019d slip through,",

    "(The nothing rising underfoot). Then later",
    "The high-dive at the pool, the tree-house perch,",
    "Ferris wheels, balconies, cliffs, a penthouse view,",
    "The merest thought of airplanes. You can call",
    "It a fear of heights, a horror of the deep;",
    "But it isn\u2019t the unfathomable fall",
    "That makes me giddy, makes my stomach lurch,",
    "It\u2019s that the ledge itself invents the leap."

    "\u201cBut can you forge a nail?\u201d the blond boy asks,",
    "And the blacksmith shoves a length of iron rod",
    "Deep in the coal fire cherished by the bellows",
    "Until it glows volcanic. He was a god",
    "Before anachronism, before the tasks",
    "That had been craft were jobbed out to machine.",
    "By dint of hammer-song he makes his keen,",
    "Raw point, and crowns utility with rose:",
    "Quincunx of facets petaling its head.",
    "The breeze-made-visible sidewinds. The boy\u2019s",
    "Blonde mother shifts and coughs.",
    "\u2014 sweat-faced, swarthy from soot, he",
    "Reminds us with the old saw he employs",
    "(And doesn\u2019t miss a beat): \u201cSmoke follows beauty.\u201d"

    "Something about the way they drop",

    "And do not wilt so much as faint,",

    "Wearing decay like diadems,",
    "Parading \ufb01nishes like starts,",
    "Something about the way they twist",
    "As if to catch the last applause,",
    "And drink the moment through long straws,",
    "And how, tomorrow, they\u2019ll be missed.",
    "The way they\u2019re somehow getting clearer,",

    "The one who can\u2019t tell left from right),",
    "Glance now over the wrong shoulder",
    "To watch them get a little older",
    "And give themselves up to the light."

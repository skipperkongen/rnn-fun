    "That it was shy when alive goes without saying.",
    "We know it vanished at the sound of voices",
    "Or footsteps. It took wing at the slightest noises,",
    "Though it could be approached by someone praying.",
    "We have no recordings of it, though of course",
    "In the basement of the Museum, we have some stuffed",
    "Moth-eaten specimens\u2014the Lesser Ruffed",

    "A species of Quiet, or of another feather,",
    "No researcher can know. Not even whether",
    "A breeding pair still nests deep in the bayou,",
    "Where legend has it some once common bird",
    "Decades ago was first not seen, not heard."

    "Something has come between us\u2014",
    "It will not sleep.",
    "Every night it rises like a fish",
    "Out of the deep.",
    "It cries with a human voice,",
    "It aches to be fed.",
    "Every night we heave it weeping",
    "Into our bed,",
    "With its heavy head lolled back,",
    "Its limbs hanging down,",
    "Like a mer-creature fetched up",
    "From the weeds of the drowned.",
    "Damp in the tidal dark, it whimpers,",
    "Tossing the cover,",
    "Separating husband from wife,",
    "Lover from lover.",
    "It settles in the interstice,",
    "It spreads out its arms,",
    "While its cool underwater face",
    "Sharpens and warms:",
    "This is the third thing that makes",
    "Father and mother,",
    "The fierce love of our fashioning",
    "That will have no brother."

    "I never glimpse her but she goes",
    "Who had been basking in the sun,",
    "Her links of chain mail one by one",
    "Aglint with pewter, bronze and rose.",
    "I never see her lying coiled",
    "Atop the garden step, or under",
    "A dark leaf, unless I blunder",
    "And by some motion she is foiled.",
    "Too late I notice as she passes",
    "Zither of chromatic scale\u2014",
    "I only ever see her tail",
    "Quicksilver into tall grasses.",
    "I know her only by her flowing,",
    "By her glamour disappearing",
    "Into shadow as I\u2019m nearing\u2014",
    "I only recognize her going."

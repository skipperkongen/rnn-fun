    "Since we still had a little",
    "Of the rusk left, what fools",
    "To eat, against the rules,",

    "Each ox huge as a tank \u2014",
    "A wall you\u2019d have to siege",
    "For forty years to reach",
    "A star, a hero\u2019s rank.",
    "We starved on the back of the earth,",
    "But when we\u2019d stuffed ourselves,",
    "We tumbled to these delves,",
    "Numbskulls, fed up with dearth."

    "You squeezed its leash in your fist,",
    "It followed where you led:",
    "Tick, tock, tick, tock,",
    "Nodding its wooden head.",
    "Wagging a tail on a spring,",
    "Its wheels gearing lackety-clack,",
    "Dogging your heels the length of the house,",
    "Though you seldom glanced back.",
    "It didn\u2019t mind being dragged",
    "When it toppled on its side",
    "Scraping its coat of primary colors:",
    "Love has no pride.",
    "But now that you run and climb",
    "And leap, it has no hope",
    "Of keeping up, so it sits, hunched",
    "At the end of its short rope",
    "And dreams of a rummage sale",
    "Where it\u2019s snapped up for a song,",
    "And of somebody\u2014somebody just like you\u2014",
    "Stringing it along."

    "When is the smell of a blackberry tree",
    "a harbinger of violent movement",
    "rather than simply the recollection of",
    "a childhood Sunday dress hem-dipped",
    "in mud, handprinted with juice and seeds?",
    "Hard to say. A mind, when playing tricks",
    "is at its most sincere \u2014 at home raking",
    "through the body\u2019s history, repeating",
    "the strange and nostalgic. The taste of",
    "dirty copper, the imagined cockroach",
    "in the corner, the sluggish slow of the clock",
    "\u2014 doctors call these strange little prophets",
    "warning signs of a seizure, synaptic misfires",
    "looming like a song discordant, until the body",
    "\u2014 an unplucked string \u2014 is finally strummed."

    "How long will the bed that we made together",
    "hold us there? \ufeffYour stubbled cheeks grazed my skin\ufeff",
    "from evening to dawn, a cloud of scattered",
    "particles now, islands of shaving foam",
    "slowly spiraling down the drain, blood drops",
    "stippling the water pink as I kiss",
    "the back of your neck, our faces framed inside",
    "a medicine cabinet mirror. The blade",
    "of your hand carves a portal out of steam,",
    "the two of us like boys behind frosted glass",
    "who wave goodbye while a car shoves off",
    "into winter. All that went unnoticed",
    "till now \u2014 empty cups of coffee stacked up",
    "in the sink, the neighborhood kids",
    "up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves.",
    "How months on a kitchen calendar drop",
    "like frozen flies, the flu season at its peak",
    "followed by a train of magic-markered",
    "xxx\u2019\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffs \u2014 nights we\u2019\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffd spend apart. Death must work",
    "that way, a string of long distance calls",
    "that only gets through to the sound of your voice",
    "on our machine, my heart\u2019\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffs mute confession",
    "screened out. How long before we turn away",
    "from flowers altogether, your blind hand",
    "reaching past our bedridden shoulders",
    "to hit that digital alarm at delayed",
    "intervals \u2014 till you shut it off completely."

    "It was a way of punishing the house, setting it ablaze",
    "in ruddy, golden flames; smoke",
    "in billows up the front stairs; walls",
    "cringing like leaves.",
    "I say, I am afraid",
    "in my own house. Do not believe",
    "started this, it was",
    "that man, who was to portray the park alone, mind you,",
    "but then became",
    "enamored of the music room.",
    "And now what have we: floods",
    "of fire rolling from room to room, furniture wrecked",
    "in seethe, my wife",
    "Lady Amelia turned",
    "wraith, God knows what fish",
    "and drowning slaves cast up in the tide",
    "along with pocket Bibles, snuffboxes, antimacassars, the",
    "familiar bric-a-brac of the well-kept house.",
    "Where are Edward, Lavinia, Jane? Why",
    "is no one crying, \u201cFire! Fire!\u201d? Am I",
    "alone?",
    "The man has no sense of proportion.",
    "He had himself lashed to the mast, once, it is said,",
    "on a steamboat off the harbor mouth",
    "in full blizzard: sailors blinded by snow, the boat",
    "crippled, led by the lead, they damn near died to a man, and he\u2014",
    "he was observing \u201cthe light at sea,\u201d he said.",
    "The painting? \u201cSoapsuds and whitewash,\u201d",
    "the critics described it so.",
    "But here, in our house, it is catastrophe",
    "of flame, not weather, he loosed.",
    "He is a man",
    "in love with last things, clearly,",
    "last things, but",
    "never understood the first, it seems to me,",
    "and certainly not the genial",
    "of decorous, daily life.",
    "What tea-times we\u2019ve known in these chambers, what sonatinas,",
    "of an evening, whist,",
    "Emmeline embroidering, the hounds calm at the hearth, now all",
    "dissolved.",
    "Perhaps there are no flames.",
    "A bloody haze arises, it could be",
    "my own eyes that fail.",
    "I hear nothing, but fear",
    "the upstairs rooms, cramped rooms",
    "I have not entered in ages, only remember",
    "the draughts, creakings, grime in closet corners,",
    "windows too tight to lean from, the smell",
    "of antique damp. And now, who knows",
    "what acts unroll",
    "on narrow beds, on floorboards warped askew?",
    "As steam is rising, rising? As heat",
    "buoys the house up into an atmosphere",
    "all of its own creation?",
    "Who are",
    "the participants? Where has Amelia gone?",
    "Why, in this furnace, can I hear no sound,",
    "or feel my own skin begin to peel?"

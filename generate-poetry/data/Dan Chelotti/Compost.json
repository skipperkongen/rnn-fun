    "With my daughter in my backpack",
    "And I opened my email",
    "On my phone and Duffie",

    "Let\u2019s rot together but not until",
    "We\u2019ve drained what sap",
    "Is left in these trees.",
    "And I wake in the morning",
    "And think of the coroner",
    "Calling to ask what color",
    "My father\u2019s eyes were,",
    "And I asked, Why? Why can\u2019t",
    "You just look \u2014 and the coroner,",
    "Matter-of-factly says, Decay.",
    "Do you want some eggs, my love?",
    "I have a new way of preparing them.",
    "And look, look outside, I think this weather",
    "Has the chance of holding."

    "There is the torch and the only thing",
    "That will prevent us from using it",
    "Is whether or not we can allow",
    "Jellyfish in the otherwise",
    "Crystalline surf. It would be easy",
    "To dismiss this view as beautiful and walk away",
    "Because it is buggy and we forgot",
    "The spray, to cancel the conversation",
    "Because its ease is perilous with conjunctions,",
    "To not touch because the sky would",
    "Separate from the sky and the mothership",
    "Would fall through with a banner",
    "Waving in a language we wouldn\u2019t",
    "Understand though the meaning is",
    "As clear as these intercontinental",
    "Contrails hatching mackerel sky",
    "Saying we are full we are full",
    "Of sound and fury, we are signifying",
    "Nothing. Damned universal law.",
    "Damned categorical imperative",
    "Elbowing its way between my hands",
    "And your face. The sparrows again",
    "Exploding against windows",
    "As a circle of men sitting outside",
    "The cafe while away their intentions",
    "With invisible motor tics they can\u2019t",
    "Even feel unless the right empire of light",
    "Covers every last inch of them",
    "And brings to the surface the names \u2014",
    "Those loves they chose",
    "To stable. And there it is:",
    "The choice \u2014 if only the metaphor",
    "Were more complex if I could only",
    "Adverb away my existence",
    "And say what a remarkable Sunday",
    "This is a perfect Sunday",
    "And turn my breath to stone.",
    "I\u2019ve done it before, I spoke",
    "The language of sweating cavern walls",
    "And electric light. But I won\u2019t go there again.",
    "We are all and only our distances",
    "And when we touch that is what we touch.",
    "Our messy shelves. Our sullen privations",
    "And overabundance of lemons.",
    "Our grief, our mountains and fields",
    "And rivers of grief. Our dismissals",
    "And the love we ignore when we don\u2019t run",
    "After the sparrows because the sparrows",
    "Will fly away. My sparrow, fly away if you have to",
    "But know that I am coming.",
    "I am low in the grass. I am burning",
    "With patience. I am every song.",
    "I know all the math in the shore",
    "Says you shouldn\u2019t but my distance",
    "Is yours if you want it. And it is yours",
    "If you don\u2019t. Dandelions and honeysuckle",
    "Surround me, the world\u2019s ineluctable fire",
    "Is looking right at me, and I am making my stand."

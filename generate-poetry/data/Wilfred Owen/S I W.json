    "I. THE PROLOGUE",
    "Patting good-bye, doubtless they told the lad",
    "He\u2019d always show the Hun a brave man\u2019s face;",
    "Father would sooner him dead than in disgrace,\u2014",
    "Was proud to see him going, aye, and glad.",
    "Perhaps his mother whimpered how she\u2019d fret",
    "Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse.",
    "Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse \u2026",
    "Brothers\u2014would send his favourite cigarette.",
    "Each week, month after month, they wrote the same,",
    "Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut,",
    "Because he said so, writing on his butt",
    "Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim",
    "And misses teased the hunger of his brain.",
    "His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand",
    "Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand",
    "From the best sand-bags after years of rain.",
    "But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,",
    "Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld",
    "For torture of lying machinally shelled,",
    "At the pleasure of this world\u2019s Powers who\u2019d run amok.",
    "He\u2019d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol.",
    "Their people never knew. Yet they were vile.",
    "\u2018Death sooner than dishonour, that\u2019s the style!\u2019",
    "So Father said.",
    "II. THE ACTION",
    "One dawn, our wire patrol",
    "Carried him. This time, Death had not missed.",
    "We could do nothing but wipe his bleeding cough.",
    "Could it be accident? - Rifles go off\u2026",
    "Not sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)",
    "III. THE POEM",
    "It was the reasoned crisis of his soul",
    "Against more days of inescapable thrall,",
    "Against infrangibly wired and blind trench wall",
    "Curtained with fire, roofed in with creeping fire,",
    "Slow grazing fire, that would not burn him whole",
    "But kept him for death\u2019s promises and scoff,",
    "And life\u2019s half-promising, and both their riling.",
    "IV. THE EPILOGUE",
    "With him they buried the muzzle his teeth had kissed,",
    "And truthfully wrote the Mother, \u2018Tim died smiling\u2019."

    "\u2018O Jesus Christ! I\u2019m hit,\u2019 he said; and died.",
    "Whether he vainly cursed or prayed indeed,",
    "The Bullets chirped\u2014In vain, vain, vain!",
    "Machine-guns chuckled\u2014Tut-tut! Tut-tut!",
    "And the Big Gun guffawed.",
    "Another sighed,\u2014\u2018O Mother,\u2014mother,\u2014Dad!\u2019",
    "Then smiled at nothing, childlike, being dead.",
    "And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud",
    "Leisurely gestured,\u2014Fool!",
    "\u2018My Love!\u2019 one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood,",
    "Till slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud.",
    "And the Bayonets\u2019 long teeth grinned;",
    "Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned;",
    "And the Gas hissed."

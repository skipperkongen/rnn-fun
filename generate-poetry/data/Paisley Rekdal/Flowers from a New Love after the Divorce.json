    "So instructs the florist\u2019s note",
    "enclosed inside the flowers.",
    "Who knew what was cut",
    "could heal again, the green wounds close,",
    "stitching themselves together?",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter. The flowers, red",
    "and white, will bloom awhile, then wither.",
    "You sit in an unlit room and watch",
    "the vase throw crystal shadows through the dark.",
    "The flowers\u2019 colors are so lovely they\u2019re painful.",
    "In a week, you\u2019ll have to throw them out.",
    "It\u2019s only hope that makes you take out scissors,",
    "separate each bloom and cut",
    "where you last measured. Did you know",
    "Venus was said to turn into a virgin",
    "each time she bathed? She did it",
    "as a mark of love. She did it",
    "so as to please her lovers. Perhaps,",
    "overwhelmed by pain,",
    "she eventually stopped bathing",
    "altogether. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a pleasure",
    "to feel the green nubs stripped, watch the stems",
    "refresh under your blade. They\u2019re here",
    "because they\u2019re beautiful. They glow",
    "inside your crystal vase. And yet",
    "the flowers by themselves are nothing:",
    "only a refraction of color that,",
    "in a week or two, will be thrown out.",
    "Day by day, the water lowers. The red-",
    "and-white heads droop, blacken at the stems.",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter. Even cut stems heal.",
    "But what is the point of pain if it heals?",
    "instructs",
    "the florist\u2019s note.",
    "says one god.",
    "says another.",
    "Venus heads, they call these flowers.",
    "In a week or two, you\u2019ll lose the note,",
    "have to call the florist up.",
    "you\u2019ll think he says.",
    "Perhaps:",
    "It doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "You\u2019ve stopped bathing. Alone,",
    "you sit before the crystal",
    "vase refracting you in pieces",
    "through the dark. You watch",
    "the pale skin bloom inside it, wither.",
    "You petal, inch by inch.",
    "You turn red and white together."

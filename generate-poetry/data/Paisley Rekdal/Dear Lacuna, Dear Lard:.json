    "I\u2019m here, one fat cherry",
    "blossom blooming like a clod,",
    "one sad groat glazing, a needle puling thread,",
    "so what, so sue me. These days what else to do but leer",
    "at any boy with just the right hairline.",
    "I say,",
    "Tart Darkling,",
    "if I could I\u2019d gin, I\u2019d bargain, I\u2019d take a little troll",
    "this moolit night, let you radish me awhile,",
    "let you gag and confound me. How much I\u2019ve struggled",
    "with despicing you, always; your false poppets, relentless",
    "distances. Yet plea-bargaining and lack of conversation",
    "continue to make me",
    "your faithful indefile. I\u2019m lonely. I\u2019ve turned",
    "all rage to rag, all pratfalls fast to fatfalls for you,",
    "My Farmer in the Dwell. So struggle, strife,",
    "so strew me, to bell with these clucking mediocrities,",
    "these anxieties over such beings thirty, still smitten",
    "with this heaven never meant for, never heard from.",
    "You\u2019ve said we\u2019re each pockmarked like a golf course",
    "with what can\u2019t be said of us, bred in us,",
    "isn\u2019t our tasty piece of nature. But I tell you",
    "I\u2019ve stars, I\u2019ve true blue depths, have learned to use",
    "the loo, the crew, the whole slough of pill-popping",
    "devices without you, your intelligent and pitiless graze.",
    "Everyone knows",
    "is just a euphemism",
    "for",
    "anyway. So screw me.",
    "Bartering Yam, regardless of want I\u2019m nothing",
    "without scope, hope, nothing",
    "without your possibility. So let\u2019s laugh",
    "like the thieves we are together, the sieves:",
    "you, my janus gate, my Sigmund Fraud,",
    "my crawling, crack-crazed street sprawled out,",
    "revisible, spell-bound.",
    "Hello, joy. I\u2019m thirsty. I\u2019m Pasty Rectum.",
    "In your absence I\u2019ve learned to fill myself",
    "with starts. Here\u2019s my paters. Here\u2019s my blue.",
    "I just wanted to write again and say",
    "how much I\u2019ve failed you."

    "And the black water under the boats with their pools",
    "of bilge rainbowed out like rinds",
    "of steak fat, the salt thick",
    "in my nostrils, but pleasant, too: details",
    "I still remember from Bishop\u2019s poem, everything",
    "else about it lost. At the docks,",
    "I watched my friend slip",
    "in her rubber boots; the wide, wet planks",
    "glossy with mosses. You must walk",
    "duckfooted to get to the boats, the black and orange",
    "fishing barrels, the air with its tang",
    "of rusted metals. There are always hooks",
    "and anchors to be found, nets and scrapings",
    "of wood planed by chisel, the way",
    "my great-grandmother was said",
    "to have worked, employed as a shipwright",
    "on the city\u2019s waterways in the \u201930s according",
    "to the newspaper clipping my grandmother",
    "photocopies for me each Christmas.",
    "The description of her gunmetal hair",
    "and slim torso clad in overalls, the hands",
    "she held out for the",
    "reporter",
    "(\u201cCallused,\u201d he noted, \u201cstrong as a man\u2019s\u201d)",
    "does not recall the woman",
    "I remember for her farm in Bothell",
    "before it became a Seattle suburb, helping me gather",
    "raspberries from the long canes",
    "she planted by her porch. We spent an afternoon",
    "together sweating in the same long-sleeved",
    "checkered shirts she\u2019d sewn us, according",
    "to the photo I no longer have, and cannot remember",
    "whether is the source or confirmation",
    "of this memory: only the papery, gray-green",
    "streaks of road dust on the canes, a bowl",
    "of chipped porcelain inside of which",
    "were raspberries. Very red, very sweet, furred",
    "like my friend\u2019s upper lip I remember",
    "between my teeth as we stood",
    "on the docks. The smell",
    "of iron and winter mist, her mouth",
    "like nothing I have tasted since."

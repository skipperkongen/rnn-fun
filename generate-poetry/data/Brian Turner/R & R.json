    "The curve of her hip where I\u2019d lay my head,",
    "that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of now, her fingers",
    "gone slow through my hair on a blue day",
    "ten thousand miles off in the future somewhere,",
    "where the beer is so cold it sweats in your hand,",
    "cool as her kissing you with crushed ice,",
    "her tongue wet with blackberry and melon.",
    "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of now.",
    "Because I\u2019m all out of adrenaline,",
    "all out of smoking incendiaries.",
    "Somewhere deep in the landscape of the brain,",
    "under the skull\u2019s blue curving dome\u2014",
    "that\u2019s where I am now, swaying",
    "in a hammock by the water\u2019s edge",
    "as soldiers laugh and play volleyball",
    "just down the beach, while others tan",
    "and talk with the nurses who bring pills",
    "to help them sleep. And if this is crazy,",
    "then let this be my sanatorium,",
    "let the doctors walk among us here",
    "marking their charts as they will.",
    "I have a lover with hair that falls",
    "like autumn leaves on my skin.",
    "Water that rolls in smooth and cool",
    "as anesthesia. Birds that carry",
    "all my bullets into the barrel of the sun."

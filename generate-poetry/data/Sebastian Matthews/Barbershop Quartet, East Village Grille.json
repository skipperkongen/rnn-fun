    "Inside the standard lunch hour din they rise, four",
    "seamless voices fused into one, floating somewhere",
    "between a low hum and a vibration, like the sound",
    "of a train rumbling beneath noisy traffic.",
    "The men are hunched around a booth table,",
    "a fire circle of coffee cups and loose fists, leaning in",
    "around the thing they are summoning forth",
    "from inside this suddenly beating four-chambered",
    "heart. I\u2019ve taken Avery out on a whim, ordered quesadillas",
    "and onion rings, a kiddy milk with three straws.",
    "We\u2019re already deep in the meal, extra napkins",
    "and wipes for the grease coating our faces",
    "and hands like mid-summer sweat. And because",
    "we\u2019re happy, lost in the small pleasures of father",
    "and son, at first their voices seem to come from inside",
    "us.",
    "Avery asks, unable",
    "to see these men wrapped in their act. I let him",
    "keep looking, rapt. And when no one is paying",
    "attention, I put down my fork and take my boy\u2019s hand,",
    "and together we dive into the song. Or maybe it pours",
    "into us, and we\u2019re the ones brimming with it."

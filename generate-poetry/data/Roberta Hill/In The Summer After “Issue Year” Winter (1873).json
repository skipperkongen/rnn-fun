    "I scratch earth around",
    "on this hill, while below me,",
    "hanging in still air, a hawk",
    "searches the creekbed for my brothers.",
    "Squat leaves, I\u2019ll braid your roots",
    "into such long ropes, they\u2019ll cover",
    "the rump of my stallion.",
    "Withered flower, feed us now",
    "buffalo rot in the waist-high grass.",
    "Hear my sisters laugh?",
    "They dream of feasts, of warriors",
    "to owl dance with them",
    "when this war is over. They don\u2019t see",
    "our children eating treebark, cornstalks,",
    "these roots. Their eyes gleam",
    "in shallow cheeks. The wagon people",
    "do not think relationship is wealth.",
    "Sisters, last night the wind",
    "returned my prayer, allowing me to hear",
    "Dog Soldiers singing at Ash Hollow.",
    "I threw away my blanket",
    "stained with lies.",
    "Above the wings of my tipi,",
    "I heard the old woman in",
    "sigh for us. Then I knew",
    "the distance of High Back Bone\u2019s death-",
    "fire from another world away. Even they",
    "may never stop its motion.",
    "Yesterday at noon, I heard",
    "my Cheyenne sister moan as she waded",
    "through deep snow before soldiers",
    "cut up her corpse to sell",
    "as souvenirs. Are my brothers",
    "here? Ghosts bring all my joy.",
    "I walk this good road between rock",
    "and sky. They dare not threaten with death",
    "one already dead."

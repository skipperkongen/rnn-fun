    "Again we meet\u2014a flashing glance,",
    "And then, to scabbard, goes the lance,",
    "While thoughts troop on in cavalcade",
    "Adown the wide aisles time has made.",
    "Back in the glow of yesterday,",
    "With tender troth you rode away,",
    "The sheen of rainbows in our eyes,",
    "That swept the rim of other skies.",
    "And now a writhing worm am I,",
    "Beneath a doomed love\u2019s lensing eye,",
    "Let me but stagger, far from sight,",
    "To hide my anguish, in the night."

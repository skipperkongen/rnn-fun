    "A woman with a burning flame",
    "Deep covered through the years",
    "With ashes. Ah! she hid it deep,",
    "And smothered it with tears.",
    "Sometimes a baleful light would rise",
    "From out the dusky bed,",
    "And then the woman hushed it quick",
    "To slumber on, as dead.",
    "At last the weary war was done",
    "The tapers were alight,",
    "And with a sigh of victory",
    "She breathed a soft\u2014good-night!"

    "Your world is as big as you make it.",
    "I know, for I used to abide",
    "In the narrowest nest in a corner,",
    "My wings pressing close to my side.",
    "But I sighted the distant horizon",
    "Where the skyline encircled the sea",
    "And I throbbed with a burning desire",
    "To travel this immensity.",
    "I battered the cordons around me",
    "And cradled my wings on the breeze,",
    "Then soared to the uttermost reaches",
    "With rapture, with power, with ease!"

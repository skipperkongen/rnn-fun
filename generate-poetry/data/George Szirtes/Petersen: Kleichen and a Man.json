    "I have seen eternity and it is like this,",
    "a man and woman dancing in a bar",
    "in a poor street on an unswept floor.",
    "It clings and plots and is desperate,",
    "at a point between violence and abjection,",
    "between warmth and agoraphobic fear.",
    "Let me reverse this and accept the fear.",
    "Let me drop all objections to abjection,",
    "since life itself is desperate",
    "and has to tread the unswept floor",
    "carefully, lovingly, while the bar",
    "hovers in eternity. Like this."

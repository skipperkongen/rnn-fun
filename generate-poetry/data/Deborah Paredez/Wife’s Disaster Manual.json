    "When the forsaken city starts to burn,",
    "after the men and children have fled,",
    "stand still, silent as prey, and slowly turn",
    "back. Behold the curse. Stay and mourn",
    "the collapsing doorways, the unbroken bread",
    "in the forsaken city starting to burn.",
    "Don\u2019t flinch. Don\u2019t join in.",
    "Resist the righteous scurry and instead",
    "stand still, silent as prey. Slowly turn",
    "your thoughts away from escape: the iron",
    "gates unlatched, the responsibilities shed.",
    "When the forsaken city starts to burn,",
    "surrender to your calling, show concern",
    "for those who remain. Come to a dead",
    "standstill. Silent as prey, slowly turn",
    "into something essential. Learn",
    "the names of the fallen. Refuse to run ahead",
    "when the forsaken city starts to burn.",
    "Stand still and silent. Pray. Return."

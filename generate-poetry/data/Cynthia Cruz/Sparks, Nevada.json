    "In the middle of the night, father",
    "Brought me a falcon.",
    "By morning, it ripped the wire and flew the hill",
    "Into the highway.",
    "When they found me in that car",
    "My sleeve stemmed in blood,",
    "I didn\u2019t know what it was",
    "I was trying to kill.",
    "I saw a craft of orphans steaming down the river.",
    "They were dressed in white and silent as a s\u00e9ance.",
    "It was then I spoke to the bird.",
    "Already God is shaking his black seed",
    "Back into me."

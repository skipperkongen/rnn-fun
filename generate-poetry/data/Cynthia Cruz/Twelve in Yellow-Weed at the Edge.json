    "Then, the police arrive \u2014 they don\u2019t find me.",
    "I\u2019m disguised as a boy in a champagne wig",
    "And hid inside the gold rattle of a warm Appalachia wind.",
    "Beneath the trash of willow, I am. The sorrow",
    "Of trailer parks and carnie uncles. The poor",
    "Girl\u2019s underworld, a weedy thing. The night,",
    "With its kingdom of lanterns and awful blue lark.",
    "How we waited, how we hid",
    "Like wolves, in the revolving question of a field."

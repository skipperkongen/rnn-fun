    "Doors opened and shut,",
    "the director shouted orders",
    "through a bullhorn,",
    "or babbled just",

    "for the next production.",
    "All of this, and more,",
    "while the actors blocked it out,",
    "already living",
    "in that small square of light",
    "where silence reigned",
    "like a tiny theatre for the deaf.",
    "Now, almost a century later,",
    "it's peaceful, far",
    "from the center of action,",
    "the last voice on the street",
    "reduced to a whisper,",
    "then gone.",
    "Not even birdsong",
    "as evening's opening credits",
    "begin to roll.",
    "Only the film,",
    "shimmering out of a disc",
    "thinner than sound,",
    "characters moving",
    "like fish in their gray element\u2014",
    "less than fish\u2014",
    "not a hiss, not a bubble,",
    "not even a cry",
    "from that dim world of silence",
    "doubled by time."

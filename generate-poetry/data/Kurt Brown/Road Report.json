    "Driving west through sandstone\u2019s",
    "red arenas, a rodeo of slow erosion",
    "cleaves these plains, these ravaged cliffs.",
    "This is cowboy country. Desolate. Dull. Except",
    "on weekends, when caf\u00e9s bloom like cactus",
    "after drought. My rented Mustang bucks",
    "the wind\u2014I\u2019m strapped up, wide-eyed,",
    "busting speed with both heels, a sure grip",
    "on the wheel. Black clouds maneuver",
    "in the distance, but I don\u2019t care. Mileage",
    "is my obsession. I\u2019m always racing off,",
    "passing through, as though the present",
    "were a dying town I\u2019d rather flee.",
    "What matters is the future, its glittering",
    "Hotel. Clouds loom closer, big as Brahmas",
    "in the heavy air. The radio crackles",
    "like a shattered rib. I\u2019m in the chute.",
    "I check the gas and set my jaw. I\u2019m almost there."

    "Minutes ago those quick cleft hoofs",
    "lifted the dik-dik\u2019s speckled frame.",
    "Now the cheetah dips her delicate head",
    "to the still-pulsating guts. Our Rover\u2019s",
    "so close we need no zoom to fix the green",
    "shot of her eyes, the matted red mess",
    "of her face. You come here, recall a father",
    "hale in his ordinary life, not his last bed,",
    "not the long tasteless slide of tapioca.",
    "This is the Great Rift, where it all began,",
    "here where the warthogs and hartebeest",
    "feed in the scrub, giraffes splay to drink,",
    "and our rank diesel exhaust darkens the air",
    "for only a few moments before vanishing."

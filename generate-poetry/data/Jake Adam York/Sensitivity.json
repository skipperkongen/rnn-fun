    "recovered from the Pearl River, May 4, 1959",
    "Six weeks since that whisper rose",
    "into the window of a stage",
    "behind the Half Note's bar,",
    "whisper Mingus let spread like a bruise,",
    "six weeks",
    "since he fell from the sky,",
    "dead off the plane from Paris,",
    "and each night this goodbye's",
    "gone more",
    "Now",
    "the flats are hid, and Handy's learned",
    "to fold the sound of breath",
    "inside his notes\u2014the bleeding throat,",
    "tongue's last epileptic flutter\u2014",
    "while Mingus thrills the bass",
    "in waves of sound and fail",
    "no microphone can hold.",
    "Drinks tremble like the river",
    "halfway from here to the grave,",
    "pulled by wind or plummet,",
    "cough of strings beneath the hand,",
    "and uptown a tape is waiting",
    "for magnets to say this again,",
    "a teletype is writing a story",
    "for tomorrow's",
    "a body pulled from a river",
    "in Mississippi, with only fingers",
    "for a name. Here",
    "only the drinks are listening",
    "as Ervin rises, ghosting Handy's lead,",
    "and even they cannot hear",
    "how the rivers heal their quiet,",
    "how they fill their scars so perfectly",
    "that remember feels like forget.",
    "Then the breath is gone.",
    "The wood hums a moment longer,",
    "and each surface smoothes",
    "till the glasses and the waters",
    "are glass again and ready",
    "to catch each clap,",
    "each note that falls."

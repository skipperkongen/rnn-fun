    "I tell my attendants,",
    "When they rub me where it itches.",
    "They rub for a few seconds, then move on,",
    "There\u2019s so much of it to wash,",
    "\u201cIt\u201d being me, a former person,",
    "Now something that must be washed every day",
    "In so little time.",
    "Fifty minutes outside my breathing machine,",
    "And all I can do is stare",
    "As my breath recedes like the woman",
    "Who would not love me.",
    "It\u2019s almost over,",
    "I say over and over to myself",
    "As soon as the machine is turned off.",
    "An idiotic mantra perhaps,",
    "But it helps when the ache descends into my eyes",
    "And my words quit coming out right.",
    "I say.",
    "the attendant says, guessing.",
    "I begin to fantasize about gusts of air",
    "Rushing down my windpipe with hurricane force.",
    "Garish and impossible, they\u2019re respiratory porn.",
    "My re-entry is stalled",
    "By the attendant straightening a sheet",
    "That no one will see.",
    "Enraged, I squeeze my eyes closed.",
    "\u201cWhat?\u201d",
    "Once back in and turned on,",
    "I cough violently and with conviction.",
    "Shocked by the force of the inrushing air,",
    "I feel my lungs expand like birthday balloons,",
    "My terror-flattened mind pops up into 3-D,",
    "As I return to the land of breathing."

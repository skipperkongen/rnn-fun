    "Ravished lute, sing to her virgin ears,",

    "O speak, sweet numbers,",
    "That pity her heart may move",
    "Before she slumbers.",
    "Pale moth, that from the moon doth fly,",
    "Fickle enchantments weaving,",
    "Night faery, come my lady nigh",
    "When the rich masques are leaving;",
    "Tell her who lieth still alone",
    "Love is a treasure",
    "Fair as the frail lute\u2019s tone",
    "And perished measure."

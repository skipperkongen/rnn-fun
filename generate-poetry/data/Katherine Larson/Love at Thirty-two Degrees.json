    "will be bleeding. That was the thing:",
    "there",
    "no blood",
    "only textures of gills creased like satin,",
    "suction cups as planets in rows.",
    "not to cut your finger, he says. But I\u2019m thinking",
    "of fingertips on my lover\u2019s neck",

    "This brachial heart. After class,",
    "I stole one from the formaldehyde",
    "& watched it bloom in my bathroom sink",
    "between cubes of ice.",
    "Last night I threw my lab coat in the fire",
    "& drove all night through the Arizona desert",
    "with a thermos full of silver tequila.",
    "It was the last of what we bought",
    "on our way back from Guadalajara\u2014",
    "desert wind in the mouth, your mother\u2019s",
    "beat-up Honda, agaves",
    "twisting up from the soil",
    "like the limbs of cephalopods.",
    "Outside of Tucson, saguaros so lovely",
    "considering the cold, & the fact that you",
    "weren\u2019t there to warm me.",
    "Suddenly drunk I was shouting that I wanted to see the stars",
    "as my ancestors used to see them\u2014",

    "Then, there is the astronomer\u2019s wife",
    "ascending stairs to her bed.",

    "as a woman\u2019s slip",
    "against cracked floorboards.",
    "So he walks to the house",
    "inflamed by moonlight, & slips",
    "into the bed with his wife",
    "her hair & arms all",
    "in disarray",
    "like fish confused by waves.",
    "Science\u2014",
    "beyond pheromones, hormones, aesthetics of bone,",
    "every time I make love for love\u2019s sake alone,",
    "I betray you."

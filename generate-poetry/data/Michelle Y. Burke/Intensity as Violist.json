    "That she was not pretty she knew.",
    "The flowers delivered into her hands post-concert by the young girl, pretty, would be acknowledged only. To display was to invite comparison.",
    "Skilled at withholding, she withheld; it was a kind of giving. As when meditation is a kind of action,",
    "a way of leaning into music the way one leans into winter wind, the way a mule leans into a harness,",
    "the way a lover leans into the point of deepest penetration.",
    "After a ship\u2019s prow cuts the water, the water rushes back twice as hard."

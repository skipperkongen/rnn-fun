    "Why are the woods so alluring? A forest appears",
    "to a young girl one morning as she combs",
    "the dreams out of her hair. The trees rustle",
    "and whisper, shimmer and hiss. The forest",
    "opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges,",
    "banging in a strong wind. Everything in the dim",
    "kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn,",
    "snickers scornfully. In this way a maiden",
    "is driven toward the dangers of a forest,",
    "but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.",
    "She\u2019s glad to lie down with trees towering all around.",
    "A certain euphoria sets in. She feels molecular,",
    "bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair,",
    "tingles with kisses she won\u2019t receive for years.",
    "Three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate",
    "her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her,",
    "or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal",
    "restlessness ...",
    "intones",
    "the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence.",
    "squeaks the shattered sapling,",
    "blackened by lightning. Their words become metallic",
    "spangles shivering the air.",
    "the third blurts.",
    "the oldest prone pine wants to know.",
    "from matter? the sapling asks.",
    ",",
    "offers the third tree, by way of consolation.",
    "impossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling,",
    "adding in a panicky voice,",
    "The girl",
    "feels her hands attach to some distant body. She rises",
    "to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her."

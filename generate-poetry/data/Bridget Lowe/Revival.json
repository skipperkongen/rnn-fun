    "Here, I am blowing this little stream",
    "of blue vapor into your parted lips.",
    "Here, I am placing my hands on your chest",
    "in an X while my red nails distract",
    "the crowd of impostor lifeguards",
    "closing in. Here is the place to raise",
    "the tent, I can feel it in my bones.",
    "The snake has perfected his skin, he is",
    "ready to be lifted and passed. How",
    "did I do it? The process was messy,",
    "I\u2019d rather not share it, but look, look",
    "at us now. Lemon drops and cherry bombs.",
    "It\u2019s the eye of the tiger, went the song",
    "I used to sing in the basement alone."

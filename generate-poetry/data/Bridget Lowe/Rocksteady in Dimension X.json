    "No longer interested in evil,",
    "the soul turns on its back",
    "at the watering hole, kicks its muscled legs.",
    "Everything goes neon pink",
    "and green in the noonday sun",
    "when I press my thumbs",
    "to my little black eyes. My snout,",
    "wet with its own abundant grease,",
    "smells nothing of threat,",
    "of consequence. I put my hands",
    "behind my head, I have no",
    "bidding to do. My feet go up",
    "on the desk, a woman appears",
    "at my side. This is what I\u2019ve earned",
    "in Eden. The right to close my eyes",
    "when the camouflage trousers",
    "come wading through",
    "the apple blossom\u2019s slough \u2014",
    "and the dream of myself as a baby",
    "emerging from the mortal",
    "body, hoof by gleaming hoof."

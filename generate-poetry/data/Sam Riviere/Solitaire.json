    "I think I always liked the game",
    "because it sounded like my name",
    "combined with the concept of alone.",
    "(My name really does mean \u201calone\u201d",
    "in Slovenian!) We don\u2019t actually care",
    "if it\u2019s true, but we want to know",
    "the person telling us is telling us",
    "the truth. Say his name is \u201cHank,\u201d",
    "as in, \u201cof hair.\u201d (It\u2019s not.) My upbringing",
    "was classically smooth/chaotic, apart",
    "from traumatic events I\u2019ve never detailed,",
    "even to myself. Traumatic but methodical.",
    "But why say what happened even.",
    "In the tech block the blinds were down",
    "and I cleared my way to the final marble",
    "under the indistinct gaze of an indistinct",
    "master. My success had allowed me",
    "to become the bastard I always knew",
    "I could be. What did it mean, to clean",
    "the board like this, counting down to one?",
    "By these gradual and orderly subtractions",
    "my persona was configured. The goal",
    "was to remain single. Sometimes telling you",
    "the truth wouldn\u2019t be telling you anything",
    "much. For a while I\u2019ve felt torpid and detuned,",
    "as if I want to share a view with you,",
    "so we can both be absent in one place.",
    "Look, the sky is beautiful and sour.",
    "I\u2019m not here, too. I\u2019m staring out of this cloud",
    "like an anagram whose solution",
    "is probably itself. I am only the method",
    "that this stupid game was invented to explain."

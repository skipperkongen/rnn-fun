    "the rose stem, water into drops, glass",

    "been rent, divided, split? Broken",
    "the days into nights, the night sky",
    "into stars, the stars into patterns",
    "I make up as I trace them",
    "with a broken-off blade",
    "of grass. Possible, unthinkable,",
    "the cricket\u2019s tiny back as I lie",
    "on the lawn in the dark, my heart",
    "a blue cup fallen from someone\u2019s hands."

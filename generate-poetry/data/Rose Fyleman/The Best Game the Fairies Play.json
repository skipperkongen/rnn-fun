    "The best game the fairies play,",
    "The best game of all,",
    "Is sliding down steeples\u2014",
    "(You know they\u2019re very tall).",
    "You fly to the weathercock,",
    "And when you hear it crow,",
    "You fold your wings and clutch your things",
    "And then let go!",
    "They have a million other games\u2014",
    "Cloud-catching\u2019s one,",
    "And mud-mixing after rain",
    "Is heaps and heaps of fun;",
    "But when you go and stay with them",
    "Never mind the rest,",
    "Take my advice\u2014they\u2019re very nice,",
    "But steeple-sliding\u2019s best!"

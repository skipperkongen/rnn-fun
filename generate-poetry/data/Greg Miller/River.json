    "A loon dives in the swollen river.",
    "It followed the river first.",
    "The town lies between it and canals",
    "Diverted from the river.",
    "The beak of the loon is orange,",
    "Its wingspan broader than a duck\u2019s.",
    "My father\u2019s legs were swollen.",
    "His once thin ankles barely fit his shoes.",
    "His heart no longer fed his body.",
    "Toxins and liquids began to drown him.",
    "His silly doctors didn\u2019t see",
    "He couldn\u2019t breathe.",
    "My father took me to the river.",
    "We fished for bass and bluegill,",
    "Sunfish, cats. Fat suckers,",
    "Their lips like suction cups,",
    "We put back. Too many little bones",
    "To catch and make you choke.",
    "I no longer want to go fishing.",
    "I don\u2019t even want to play",
    "In the water. The boat",
    "Here has no oars, the current",
    "Is too swift. In the dark, teenagers",
    "Discover their body together.",
    "The body feels like a prison.",
    "I kneel by my father\u2019s stapled body.",
    "He suctions thick liquid from his lungs.",
    "He coughs to clear them; it hurts.",
    "He wants more air. He wants",
    "To live, the heart\u2019s valve's parachutes",
    "Opening with oxygen to feed",
    "The body\u2019s healing. A tube",
    "Empties the chest cavity. He excretes",
    "Liquids and poisons.",
    "His shocked kidneys come to life.",
    "His stunned heart beats. His lung",
    "Opens again. He eats. He poops.",
    "He walks. He wants to go home.",
    "On the phone, I catch my sister",
    "Taking him home. It\u2019s snowing.",
    "It\u2019s cold. My brother and mother",
    "Help him climb the stairs.",
    "I walk down the path",
    "By the shallow canal. I see",
    "A falcon fishing. The power plant",
    "Breathes steam. I hope",
    "The wind won\u2019t singe me.",
    "I come to the falls",
    "Where a little dog",
    "Barks and bounces hello. His owner",
    "Smiles and greets me. In the church",
    "Of Saint Laurence I kneel, I",
    "Give thanks, my heart jumps."

    "It begins in a cow lane",

    "courses along corn, rushes",
    "against rocks.",
    "It rises to a teetering pitch",
    "as I cross a shaky tree-bridge,",

    "of trash\u2014derelict icebox",
    "with a missing door,",
    "mohair loveseat sinking",
    "into thistle. It winds through green",
    "adder\u2019s mouth, faint as the bells",
    "of Holsteins heading home.",
    "Blue shadows lengthen,",
    "but the undertow",
    "of a harmony pulls me on",
    "through raspy Joe-pye-weed",
    "and staccato-barbed fence.",
    "It hums in a culvert",
    "beneath cars, then empties",
    "into a river that flows oboe-deep",
    "past Indian dance ground, waterwheel",
    "and town, past the bleached",
    "stones in the churchyard,",
    "the darkening hill."

    "The boy and the girl were mostly gesture,",
    "a clouded outline, the pencil lifting, lowering",
    "to get at the idea of childhood, not the sour milk",
    "and scraped knee of it. Her skirt was a swoop",
    "of ink, his hand invisible in an undrawn pocket.",
    "Circles make up the majority of the face. We are all circles",
    "and planar suggestion. If the girl wants to be a horse",
    "she need only walk into the outline of one",
    "and line up her body with the chest. We\u2019ll fill in",
    "the rest, and before you know it, she\u2019s a natural.",
    "Who will ride her? The boy doesn\u2019t know how.",
    "He has a hankering to sketch in a saddle.",
    "When she tosses her head, he mocks up a bridle.",
    "He mocks her. A bridle for a bride, he says,",
    "which doesn\u2019t seem like what little boys say,",
    "but he wasn\u2019t so little, and she didn\u2019t run away."

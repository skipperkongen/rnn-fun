    "Since you dare Brave me, with a Rivals Name,",
    "You shall prevail, and I will quite my Claime:",
    "For know, proud Maid, I Scorn to call him mine,",
    "Whom thou durst ever hope to have made thine:",
    "Yet I confess, I lov\u2019d him once so well,",
    "His presence was my Heav\u2019n, his absence Hell:",
    "With gen\u2019rous excellence I fill\u2019d his Brest,",
    "And in sweet Beauteous Forms his Person drest;",
    "For him I did heaven, and its Pow\u2019r despise,",
    "And onely lived by th\u2019Influence of his Eyes:",
    "I fear\u2019d not Rivals, for I thought that he",
    "That was possess\u2019d of such a Prize as me,",
    "All meaner Objects wou\u2019d Contemn, and Slight,",
    "Nor let an abject thing Usurpe my Right:",
    "But when I heard he was so wretched Base",
    "To pay devotion to thy wrinkled Face",
    "I Banish\u2019t him my sight, and told the Slave,",
    "He had not Worth, but what my Fancy gave:",
    "\u2019Twas I that rais\u2019d him to this Glorious State,",
    "And can as easily Annihilate:",
    "But let him live, Branded with Guilt and Shame,",
    "And Shrink into the Shade from whence he came;",
    "His Punishment shall be, the Loss of Me,",
    "And be Augumented, by his gaining Thee."

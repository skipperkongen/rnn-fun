    "My Love? alas! I must not call you Mine,",
    "But to your envy\u2019d Bride that Name resign:",
    "I must forget your lovely melting Charms,",
    "And be for ever Banisht from your Arms:",
    "For ever? oh! the Horror of that Sound!",
    "It gives my bleeding Heart a deadly wound:",
    "While I might hope, although my Hope was vain,",
    "It gave some Ease to my unpitty\u2019d Pain,",
    "But now your",
    "doth all Hope exclude,",
    "And but to think is Sin; yet you intrude",
    "On every Thought; if I but close my Eyes,",
    "Methinks your pleasing Form besides me lies;",
    "With every Sigh I gently breath your Name,",
    "Yet no ill Thoughts pollute my hallow\u2019d Flame;",
    "\u2019Tis pure and harmless, as a Lambent Fire,",
    "And never mingled with a warm Desire:",
    "All I have now to ask of Bounteous Heaven,",
    "Is, that your Perjuries may be forgiven:",
    "That she who you have with your Nuptials blest,",
    "As She\u2019s the Happiest Wife, may prove the Best:",
    "That all our Joys may light on you alone,",
    "Then I can be contented to have none:",
    "And never wish that you shou\u2019d kinder be,",
    "Than now and then, to cast a Thought on Me:",
    "And, Madam, though the Conquest you have won,",
    "Over my Strephon, has my hopes undone;",
    "I\u2019le daily beg of Heaven, he may be",
    "Kinder to You, than he has been to Me."

    "Kitten curious, or roaring down drinks",
    "in Soho sumps, small hours tour buses,",
    "satellite station green rooms, or conked",
    "out in the bathtubs of motorway hotels,",
    "there you were, with muck-about kisses,",
    "sharking for the snappers, before hell",
    "opened up for you and weeping sores",
    "of after fame appeared, the haphazardry",
    "and dwindling after three limelit years,",
    "recognized with catcalls, wads of spit,",
    "a nightclub fist, the scant camaraderie",
    "melts fast, like your flat on Air Street,",
    "the Lhasa Apso pups, the wraps and lines",
    "of chang, the poster pull-outs, fake tan",
    "smiles. It\u2019s paunch and palimony time",
    "on Lucifer\u2019s leash. But for a madcap few",
    "who cling, thin soup, one pillow Britain",
    "is simmering with hatred, just for you."

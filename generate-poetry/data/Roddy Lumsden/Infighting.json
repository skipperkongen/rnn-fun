    "Take this: for nothing here\u2019s chiming, vibrating",
    "and all this vainglory and self-deprecating",
    "just goads at the tender parts, gets irritating.",
    "You\u2019ll make no advance advocating monopoly",
    "on any vocabulary; even cacophony",
    "needs the needle to make its point properly.",
    "It\u2019s true that you find yourself fey and bewitching,",
    "yet always you feel that the itch that you\u2019re scratching\u2019s",
    "soothed better by far by bravadoes of bitching.",
    "The off-pat flyting, back-biting and threnody",
    "you render and throw up, at will, won\u2019t remedy",
    "the rot of your serenading, lute-laden wannabe.",
    "You can\u2019t see a barrier without pushing through it;",
    "it\u2019s a poor pearl of pathos you don\u2019t disintuit",
    "and you now give a doing when once you\u2019d just do it.",
    "You want my advice? Here it is: try removing",
    "the self from your argument - gluts of self-loving",
    "just pudding the gut of whatever you\u2019re proving.",
    "That\u2019s it on the chin and I\u2019m sure you can take it,",
    "but that shadow you\u2019re boxing is me, so please break it",
    "gently. Best wishes, I hope that you make it."

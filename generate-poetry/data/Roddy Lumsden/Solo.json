    "For once, I felt wanted, dead or alive,",
    "the day my fame outgrew the Famous Five.",
    "There came a time I could give no more",
    "to the other guys in the Gang of Four",
    "and I felt the dead weight fall from me",
    "when I unyoked the clowns of the Crucial Three.",
    "I considered all this as I boarded the bus",
    "to quit the town not big enough for both of us.",
    "One eye didn\u2019t seem so much to leave behind",
    "as I sped to my job in the kingdom of the blind."

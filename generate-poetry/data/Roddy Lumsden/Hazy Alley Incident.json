    "Girl shouting",
    "at the top of the cut-through",
    "by Jacob\u2019s Gallery, you have now entered",
    "the slenderest of histories, the skin-bound book",
    "I store between my temples; in that mean",
    "and moonless city, you must hang fraught",
    "in your too-long coat, not a winner, but placed,",
    "and in this cutty version of forever, forever",
    "calling on your unseen beau, one flake in",
    "a limbic blizzard, one spark in the synaptic blaze.",
    "And now the rain turns, light but going steady",
    "on the Willamette. Along the bank, I lift my pace",
    "from",
    "to",
    "and still your mouth in the haze calling is",
    "a ruby carbuncle woken by a miner\u2019s head-beam,",
    "the reddest berry in the hedgerow, which all",
    "but the bird in the fable know not to pluck."

    "A word you can\u2019t quite say",
    "without itching, flinching; it\u2019s not easy",
    "to ignore its squirming appetite, stay",
    "your primal juddering. And yes, at",
    "night, each microbe gurns in the salty sea",
    "of gut and gullet, born again, boldly eats",
    "as you ate it, brews its own queasy tea",
    "of proto-raunch which it will quickly sate,",
    "birthing wanderlusting vigors, as yet",
    "unknown to microscience. They sashay, set",
    "out for the toes or gape through your eyes at",
    "your drooping lids, your fat bunch of keys, at",
    "this internal motel\u2019s boss, bellhop, lackey, sat",
    "in the throne of his slumber, a mercy seat."

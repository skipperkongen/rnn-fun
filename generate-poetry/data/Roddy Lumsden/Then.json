    "For the first time, I listen to a lost",
    "and secret recording of us",
    "making love near-on ten years ago.",
    "I recognize your voice, your sounds,",
    "though if I knew no better,",
    "I could be any man in any room.",

    "and of dressing and once",
    "as you step up close to the deck,",

    "I call on you to hurry and we leave.",
    "It does not end then; the tape rolls on.",
    "A few late cars which sigh by",
    "might have passed us walking away",
    "triumphant, unaware we\u2019ve left behind",
    "this mop and mow mechanism",
    "of silence to which we may never return."

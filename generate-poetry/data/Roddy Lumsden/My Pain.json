    "I\u2019m trying to string together three words",
    "which I hate more than I hate myself:",
    "and...when I realise",
    "that words no longer count for much at all.",
    "And that\u2019s me back down, head on the floor.",
    "It\u2019s like Cathal Coughlan goes in his song:",
    "till I\u2019ve seen how low I can go.",
    "It\u2019s like what my ancestor told me in a dream:",
    "It\u2019s like what I told the lassie from the local paper:",
    "And face it, while we\u2019re at it, it\u2019s like",
    "what curly Shona said that night at Graffiti",
    "when all the gang were gathered for the show:",
    "how she reckoned I would be the first to die,",
    "or the time I slipped back from the bogs in Bo\u2019s",
    "to hear my best friend tell a stranger girl",
    "who\u2019d been sweet in my company,",
    "with Roddy, he\u2019s damaged goods, you know."

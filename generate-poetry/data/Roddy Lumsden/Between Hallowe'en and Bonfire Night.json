    "Just then, encountering my ruddy face",
    "in the grand piano's cold black craquelure,",
    "it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon",
    "dipping up over the roofs of the Tenderloin.",
    "Only when I have done with the myths\u2014",
    "the inner spill that triggers us to flame,",
    "breasts so sensitive a moment's touch",
    "will call down fever; the dark sea-lane",
    "between limbic squall and the heart's harbour\u2014",
    "will I picture you, just beyond innocence,",
    "lying stripped by a thrown-wide window,",
    "letting the cool breeze covet your ardour."

    "You bastards! It\u2019s all sherbet, and folly",
    "makes you laugh like mules. Chances",
    "dance off your wrists, each day ready,",
    "sprites in your bones and spite not yet",
    "swollen, not yet set. You gather handful",
    "after miracle handful, seeing straight,",
    "reaching the lighthouse in record time,",
    "pockets brim with scimitar things. Now",
    "is not a pinpoint but a sprawling realm.",
    "Bewilderment and thrill are whip-quick",
    "twins, carried on your backs, each vow",
    "new to touch and each mistake a broken",
    "biscuit. I was you. Sea robber boarding",
    "the won galleon. Roaring trees. Machines",
    "without levers, easy in bowel and lung.",
    "One cartwheel over the quicksand curve",
    "of Tuesday to Tuesday and you\u2019re gone,",
    "summering, a ship on the farthest wave."

    "Growing up, I barely knew the Bible, but read",
    "and reread the part when Cain drifted east",
    "or was drawn that way, into a place of desolation,",
    "the land of Nod, there to begin, with a wife",
    "of unknown origin, another race of men,",
    "under the mark of God. As a boy, I thought Nod",
    "would be a place where the blue scillas",
    "would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw,",
    "the serrated sword, where the very serving cups",
    "were bone. As a grown man, I\u2019ve heard that Nod",
    "never was a nation\u2014of Cain\u2019s offspring, or anyone\u2014",
    "but a mistranslation of \u201cwander,\u201d so Cain",
    "could go wherever, and be in Nod. Far more",
    "than in God, I believe in Cain, who destroyed",
    "his own brother, and therefore in any city",
    "could have his wish, and be alone."

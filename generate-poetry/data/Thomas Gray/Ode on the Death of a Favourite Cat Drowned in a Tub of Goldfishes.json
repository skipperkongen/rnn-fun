    "\u2019Twas on a lofty vase\u2019s side,",
    "Where China\u2019s gayest art had dyed",
    "The azure flowers that blow;",
    "Demurest of the tabby kind,",
    "The pensive Selima, reclined,",
    "Gazed on the lake below.",
    "Her conscious tail her joy declared;",
    "The fair round face, the snowy beard,",
    "The velvet of her paws,",
    "Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,",
    "Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,",
    "She saw; and purred applause.",
    "Still had she gazed; but \u2019midst the tide",
    "Two angel forms were seen to glide,",
    "The genii of the stream;",
    "Their scaly armour\u2019s Tyrian hue",
    "Through richest purple to the view",
    "Betrayed a golden gleam.",
    "The hapless nymph with wonder saw;",
    "A whisker first and then a claw,",
    "With many an ardent wish,",
    "She stretched in vain to reach the prize.",
    "What female heart can gold despise?",
    "What cat\u2019s averse to fish?",
    "Presumptuous maid! with looks intent",
    "Again she stretch\u2019d, again she bent,",
    "Nor knew the gulf between.",
    "(Malignant Fate sat by, and smiled)",
    "The slippery verge her feet beguiled,",
    "She tumbled headlong in.",
    "Eight times emerging from the flood",
    "She mewed to every watery god,",
    "Some speedy aid to send.",
    "No dolphin came, no Nereid stirred;",
    "Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard;",
    "A Favourite has no friend!",
    "From hence, ye beauties, undeceived,",
    "Know, one false step is ne\u2019er retrieved,",
    "And be with caution bold.",
    "Not all that tempts your wandering eyes",
    "And heedless hearts, is lawful prize;",
    "Nor all that glisters, gold."

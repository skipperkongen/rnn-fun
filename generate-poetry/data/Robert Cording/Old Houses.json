    "Year after year after year",
    "I have come to love slowly",
    "how old houses hold themselves\u2014",
    "before November\u2019s drizzled rain",
    "or the refreshing light of June\u2014",
    "as if they have all come to agree",
    "that, in time, the days are no longer",
    "a matter of suffering or rejoicing.",
    "I have come to love",
    "how they take on the color of rain or sun",
    "as they go on keeping their vigil",
    "without need of a sign, awaiting nothing",
    "more than the birds that sing from the eaves,",
    "the seizing cold that sounds the rafters."

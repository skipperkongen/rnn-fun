    "If I were in a book it would be the book",
    "in which some lesser angel bemoans",
    "the state of my soul",
    "and is comforted for it",
    "and is corrected for it",
    "by some greater angel who knows",
    "as the reader knows that it is not one\u2019s soul",
    "that suffers the indignities of ignobility:",
    "the inability to curb the petty smallness",
    "of spirit, ungladness in the company",
    "of bureaucrats, anger\u2019s decay,",
    "in the sense that my soul itself cannot be",
    "harmed nor tarnished though it can witness",
    "my sorrow on finding that illness alters me",
    "from the self I thought I\u2019d more or less known.",
    "What can one do about one\u2019s nature?",
    "I look at the spider that\u2019s finally",
    "restrung its great wheel away from the door.",
    "I\u2019d like to close the door, go away,",
    "leaving the spider be.",
    "I\u2019d like to preclude the possibility",
    "of angel, as of prey."

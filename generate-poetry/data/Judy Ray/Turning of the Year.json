    "We never know if the turn",
    "is into the home stretch.",
    "We call it that\u2014a stretch",
    "of place and time\u2014",
    "with vision of straining,",
    "racing. We acknowledge",
    "each turn with cheers",
    "though we don\u2019t know",
    "how many laps remain.",
    "But we can hope the course",
    "leads on far and clear",
    "while the horses have strength",
    "and balance on their lean legs,",
    "fine-tuned muscles, desire",
    "for the length of the run.",
    "Some may find the year smooth,",
    "others stumble at obstacles",
    "along the way. We never know",
    "if the finish line will be reached",
    "after faltering, slowing,",
    "or in mid-stride, leaping forward."

    "Beside the highway, the Giant Slide",
    "with its rusty undulations lifts",
    "out of the weeds. It hasn\u2019t been used",
    "for a generation. The ticket booth",
    "tilts to that side where the nickels shifted",
    "over the years. A chain link fence keeps out",
    "the children and drunks. Blue morning glories",
    "climb halfway up the stairs, bright clusters",
    "of laughter. Call it a passing fancy,",
    "this slide that nobody slides down now.",
    "Those screams have all gone east",
    "on a wind that will never stop blowing",
    "down from the Rockies and over the plains,",
    "where things catch on for a little while,",
    "bright leaves in a fence, and then are gone."

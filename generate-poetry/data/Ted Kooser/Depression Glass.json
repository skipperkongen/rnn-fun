    "the plates like the panes of ice",
    "she broke from the water bucket",
    "winter mornings, the flaring cups",

    "with your coffee cold, but it was",
    "a special occasion, just the same,",
    "to sit at her kitchen table",
    "and sip the bitter percolation",

    "it had taken a year to collect",
    "at the grocery, with one piece free",
    "for each five pounds of flour."

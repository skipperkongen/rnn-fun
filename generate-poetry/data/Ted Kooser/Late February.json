    "The first warm day,",
    "and by mid-afternoon",
    "the snow is no more",
    "than a washing",
    "strewn over the yards,",
    "the bedding rolled in knots",
    "and leaking water,",
    "the white shirts lying",
    "under the evergreens.",
    "Through the heaviest drifts",
    "rise autumn\u2019s fallen",
    "bicycles, small carnivals",
    "of paint and chrome,",
    "the Octopus",
    "and Tilt-A-Whirl",
    "beginning to turn",
    "in the sun. Now children,",
    "stiffened by winter",
    "and dressed, somehow,",
    "like old men, mutter",
    "and bend to the work",
    "of building dams.",
    "But such a spring is brief;",
    "by five o\u2019clock",
    "the chill of sundown,",
    "darkness, the blue TVs",
    "flashing like storms",
    "in the picture windows,",
    "the yards gone gray,",
    "the wet dogs barking",
    "at nothing. Far off",
    "across the cornfields",
    "staked for streets and sewers,",
    "the body of a farmer",
    "missing since fall",
    "will show up",
    "in his garden tomorrow,",
    "as unexpected",
    "as a tulip."

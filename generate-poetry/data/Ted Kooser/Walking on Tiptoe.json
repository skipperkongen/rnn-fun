    "Long ago we quit lifting our heels",
    "like the others\u2014horse, dog, and tiger\u2014",
    "though we thrill to their speed",
    "as they flee. Even the mouse",
    "bearing the great weight of a nugget",
    "of dog food is enviably graceful.",
    "There is little spring to our walk,",
    "we are so burdened with responsibility,",
    "all of the disciplinary actions",
    "that have fallen to us, the punishments,",
    "the killings, and all with our feet",
    "bound stiff in the skins of the conquered.",
    "But sometimes, in the early hours,",
    "we can feel what it must have been like",
    "to be one of them, up on our toes,",
    "stealing past doors where others are sleeping,",
    "and suddenly able to see in the dark."

    "It is her right, to bind with warmest ties,",
    "The lordly spirit of aspiring man,",
    "Making his home an earthly paradise,",
    "Rich in all joys allotted to life\u2019s span;",
    "Twining around each fibre of his heart,",
    "With all the gentle influence of love\u2019s might,",
    "Seeking no joy wherein he has no part \u2013",
    "This is undoubtedly \u2013 a woman\u2019s right!",
    "It is her right to teach the infant mind,",
    "Training it ever upward in its course,",
    "To root out evil passions that would bind",
    "The upward current of his reason\u2019s force;",
    "To lead the erring spirit gently back,",
    "When it has sunk in gloom of deepest night;",
    "To point the shining path of virtue\u2019s track,",
    "And urge him forward. This is woman\u2019s right.",
    "It is her right to soothe the couch of pain;",
    "There her pure mission upon earth to prove,",
    "To calm with gentle care the frenzied brain,",
    "And keep her vigil there of holiest love;",
    "To watch untiring by the lonely bed,",
    "Through the bright day, and in the solemn night,",
    "\u2019Til health ensues, or the loved form is laid",
    "To rest for ever. This is woman\u2019s right.",
    "She is a flower that blossoms best, unseen,",
    "Sheltered within the precincts of her home;",
    "There, should no dark\u2019ning storm-cloud intervene,",
    "There, the loud-strife of worldlings never come.",
    "Let her not scorn to act a",
    "part,",
    "Nor strive to cope with manhood in its might,",
    "But lay this maxim closely to her heart \u2013",
    "That that which God ordains is surely right."

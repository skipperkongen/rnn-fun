    "Each night, in a space he\u2019d make",
    "between waking and purpose,",
    "my grandfather donned his one",
    "suit, in our still dark house, and drove",
    "through Brooklyn\u2019s deserted streets",
    "following trolley tracks to the bakery.",
    "There he\u2019d change into white",
    "linen work clothes and cap,",
    "and in the absence of women,",
    "his hands were both loving, well",
    "into dawn and throughout the day\u2014",
    "kneading, rolling out, shaping",
    "each astonishing moment",
    "of yeasty predictability",
    "in that windowless world lit",
    "by slightly swaying naked bulbs,",
    "where the shadows staggered, woozy",
    "with the aromatic warmth of the work.",
    "Then, the suit and drive, again.",
    "At our table, graced by a loaf",
    "that steamed when we sliced it,",
    "softened the butter and leavened",
    "the very air we\u2019d breathe,",
    "he\u2019d count us blessed."

    "All morning, doing the hard, root-wrestling",
    "work of turning a yard from the wild",
    "to a gardener\u2019s will, I heard a bird singing",
    "from a hidden, though not distant, perch;",
    "a song of swift, syncopated syllables sounding",
    "like,",
    "Can you believe this, believe this, believe?",
    "And all morning, I did believe. All morning,",
    "between break-even bouts with the unwanted,",
    "I wanted to see that bird, and looked up so",
    "I might later recognize it in a guide, and know",
    "and call its name, but even more, I wanted",
    "to join its church. For all morning, and many",
    "a time in my life, I have wondered who, beyond",
    "this plot I work, has called the order of being,",
    "that givers of food are deemed lesser",
    "than are the receivers. All morning,",
    "muscling my will against that of the wild,",
    "to claim a place in the bounty of earth,",
    "seed, root, sun and rain, I offered my labor",
    "as a kind of grace, and gave thanks even",
    "for the aching in my body, which reached",
    "beyond this work and this gift of struggle."

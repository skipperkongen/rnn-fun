    "These alternate nights and days, these seasons",
    "Somehow fail to convince me. It seems",
    "I have the sense of infinity!",
    "(In your dreams, O crew of Columbus,",
    "O listeners over the sea",
    "For the surf that breaks upon Nothing\u2014)",
    "Once I was waked by the nightingales in the garden.",
    "I thought, What time is it? I thought,",
    "Time\u2014Is it Time still?\u2014Now is it Time?",
    "(Tell me your dreams, O sailors:",
    "Tell me, in sleep did you climb",
    "The tall masts, and before you\u2014)",
    "At night the stillness of old trees",
    "Is a leaning over and the inertness",
    "Of hills is a kind of waiting.",
    "(In sleep, in a dream, did you see",
    "The world\u2019s end? Did the water",
    "Break\u2014and no shore\u2014Did you see?)",
    "Strange faces come through the streets to me",
    "Like messengers: and I have been warned",
    "By the moving slowly of hands at a window.",
    "Oh, I have the sense of infinity\u2014",
    "But the world, sailors, is round.",
    "They say there is no end to it."

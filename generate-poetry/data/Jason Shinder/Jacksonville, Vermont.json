    "Because I am not married, I have the skin of an orange",
    "that has spent its life in the dark. Inside the orange I am blind.",
    "I cannot tell when a hand reaches in and breaks",
    "the atoms of the blood. Sometimes a blackbird will bring the wind",
    "into my hair. Or the yellow clouds falling on the cold floor",
    "are animals fighting each other",
    "out of their drifting misery. All the women I have known",
    "have been ruined by fog and the deer crossing the field at night."

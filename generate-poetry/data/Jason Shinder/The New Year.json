    "I will dive to the bottom of the hotel pool and find my mother\u2019s hairpin.",
    "With the mouth of a drowning woman on my lap,",
    "I will add her breath to mine. In the dark, I will lay the thin white sheet",
    "of the moonlight over the blue plums of my wife\u2019s breasts.",
    "With the new planet I discovered just when I thought I was losing my sight,",
    "I will love another man because I will be a woman.",
    "Everything important will never as yet have happened. Let it happen.",
    "I will throw a lit match on the secrets my body",
    "has kept from me and stand in the fire. The people I have sawed in half",
    "will appear in my bedroom mirror, getting dressed."

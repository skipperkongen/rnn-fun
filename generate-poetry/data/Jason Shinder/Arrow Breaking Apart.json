    "While lovers sleep, I dig my nails into the earth,",

    "of the Universe and my voice plugged into the waves",
    "at the bottom of the ocean.",
    "My heart is taped up like a child\u2019s drawing",
    "of the moon over the broken window of the sky",
    "where the wind always comes back to fill my lungs.",
    "I will dance on my shadow. I will open my mouth",
    "with the air inside my mother\u2019s coffin.",
    "I will be the arrow breaking apart in the body",
    "of the blackbird, which appears at my window, singing."

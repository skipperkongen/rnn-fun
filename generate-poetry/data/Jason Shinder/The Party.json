    "And that\u2019s how it is; everyone standing up from the big silence",
    "of the table with their glasses of certainty and plates of forgiveness",
    "and walking into the purple kitchen; everyone leaning away from the gas stove",
    "Marie blows on at the very edge of the breaking blue-orange-lunging-",
    "forward flames to warm another pot of coffee, while the dishes pile up in the sink,",
    "perfect as a pyramid.",
    ", says Donna, closing her eyes,",
    "and leaning on Nick\u2019s shoulders as he drives the soft blade of the knife",
    "through the glittering dark of the leftover chocolate birthday cake.",
    "That\u2019s it; that\u2019s how it is; everyone standing around as if just out of the pool,",
    "drying off, standing around, that\u2019s it, standing, talking,",
    "shuffling back and forth on the deck of the present",
    "before the boat slowly pulls away into the future. Because it hurts",
    "to say goodbye, to pull your body out of the warm water;",
    "to step out of the pocket of safety, clinging to what you knew,",
    "or what you thought you knew about yourself and others.",
    "That\u2019s how it is, that\u2019s it, throwing your jacket over your shoulders",
    "like a towel and saying goodbye Victoria goodbye Sophie goodbye",
    "Lili goodbye sweetie take care be well hang in there see you soon."

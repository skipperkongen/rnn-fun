    "Hamlet noticed them in the shapes of clouds,",
    "but I saw them in the furniture of childhood,",
    "creatures trapped under surfaces of wood,",
    "one submerged in a polished sideboard,",
    "one frowning from a chair-back,",
    "another howling from my mother\u2019s silent bureau,",
    "locked in the grain of maple, frozen in oak.",
    "I would see these presences, too,",
    "in a swirling pattern of wallpaper",
    "or in the various greens of a porcelain lamp,",
    "each looking so melancholy, so damned,",
    "some peering out at me as if they knew",
    "all the secrets of a secretive boy.",
    "Many times I would be daydreaming",
    "on the carpet and one would appear next to me,",
    "the oversize nose, the hollow look.",
    "So you will understand my reaction",
    "this morning at the beach",
    "when you opened your hand to show me",
    "a stone you had picked up from the shoreline.",
    "\u201cDo you see the face?\u201d you asked",
    "as the cold surf circled our bare ankles.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s the eye and the line of the mouth,",
    "like it\u2019s grimacing, like it\u2019s in pain.\u201d",
    "\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s because it has a fissure",
    "running down the length of its forehead",
    "not to mention a kind of twisted beak,\u201d I said,",
    "taking the thing from you and flinging it out",
    "over the sparkle of blue waves",
    "so it could live out its freakish existence",
    "on the dark bottom of the sea",
    "and stop bothering innocent beachgoers like us,",
    "stop ruining everyone\u2019s summer."

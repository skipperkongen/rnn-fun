    "Why do we bother with the rest of the day,",

    "the sudden dip into evening,",

    "his many-pointed stars?",
    "This is the best\u2014",
    "throwing off the light covers,",
    "feet on the cold floor,",
    "and buzzing around the house on espresso\u2014",
    "maybe a splash of water on the face,",
    "a palmful of vitamins\u2014",
    "but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,",
    "dictionary and atlas open on the rug,",
    "the typewriter waiting for the key of the head,",
    "a cello on the radio,",
    "and, if necessary, the windows\u2014",
    "trees fifty, a hundred years old",
    "out there,",
    "heavy clouds on the way",
    "and the lawn steaming like a horse",
    "in the early morning."

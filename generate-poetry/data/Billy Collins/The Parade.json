    "How exhilarating it was to march",
    "along the great boulevards",
    "in the sunflash of trumpets",
    "and under all the waving flags\u2014",
    "the flag of ambition, the flag of love.",
    "So many of us streaming along\u2014",
    "all of humanity, really\u2014",
    "moving in perfect step,",
    "yet each lost in the room of a private dream.",
    "How stimulating the scenery of the world,",
    "the rows of roadside trees,",
    "the huge curtain of the sky.",
    "How endless it seemed until we veered",
    "off the broad turnpike",
    "into a pasture of high grass,",
    "headed toward the dizzying cliffs of mortality.",
    "Generation after generation,",
    "we keep shouldering forward",
    "until we step off the lip into space.",
    "And I should not have to remind you",
    "that little time is given here",
    "to rest on a wayside bench,",
    "to stop and bend to the wildflowers,",
    "or to study a bird on a branch\u2014",
    "not when the young",
    "are always shoving from behind,",
    "not when the old keep tugging us forward,",
    "pulling on our arms with all their feeble strength."

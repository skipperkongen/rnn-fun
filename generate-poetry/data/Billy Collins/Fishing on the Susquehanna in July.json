    "I have never been fishing on the Susquehanna",
    "or on any river for that matter",
    "to be perfectly honest.",
    "Not in July or any month",
    "have I had the pleasure\u2014if it is a pleasure\u2014",
    "of fishing on the Susquehanna.",
    "I am more likely to be found",
    "in a quiet room like this one\u2014",
    "a painting of a woman on the wall,",
    "a bowl of tangerines on the table\u2014",
    "trying to manufacture the sensation",
    "of fishing on the Susquehanna.",
    "There is little doubt",
    "that others have been fishing",
    "on the Susquehanna,",
    "rowing upstream in a wooden boat,",
    "sliding the oars under the water",
    "then raising them to drip in the light.",
    "But the nearest I have ever come to",
    "fishing on the Susquehanna",
    "was one afternoon in a museum in Philadelphia",
    "when I balanced a little egg of time",
    "in front of a painting",
    "in which that river curled around a bend",
    "under a blue cloud-ruffled sky,",
    "dense trees along the banks,",
    "and a fellow with a red bandanna",
    "sitting in a small, green",
    "flat-bottom boat",
    "holding the thin whip of a pole.",
    "That is something I am unlikely",
    "ever to do, I remember",
    "saying to myself and the person next to me.",
    "Then I blinked and moved on",
    "to other American scenes",
    "of haystacks, water whitening over rocks,",
    "even one of a brown hare",
    "who seemed so wired with alertness",
    "I imagined him springing right out of the frame."

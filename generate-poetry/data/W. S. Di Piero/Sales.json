    "of ukuleles stretching their necks from yards",
    "of canvas duffel yoked across his shoulders,",
    "auroral azul, cherry pop, or mojito green,",
    "under this Pac Heights sky where the awful rich",
    "snap their heels past shop windows, past goatskin bags",
    "and spiked heels that bring them closer to heaven,",
    "\ufb01bristic sheets of celadon paper from Zhejiang,",
    "Smiling past them, he passes with his happy load,",
    "a display model whole and nude in his hand,",
    "on sale to no one, uplifted like a Stratocaster",
    "sacramental from mahogany forests in Paraguay."

    "bleeding arterial tail lights across gray water",
    "and its blue heart. Under Lemon Hill,",
    "grunts from Boathouse Row, woodshop clunks,",
    "young men\u2019s voices too loud for a day",
    "exhaling into starless skies, bad boys",
    "after keg night, hungover, push long sculls",
    "into the water and slice its marcelled run,",
    "a marbled peacock wake behind each stroke",
    "and coxswain counting that muscled steadiness",
    "past the Water Works, Spring Garden Street Bridge",
    "then Girard Avenue Bridge, where on the bank",
    "Eakins sketches Max Schmitt in a single scull,",
    "his light like this, tinfoil blue, where the crews sweat off",
    "last night\u2019s lost time but won\u2019t row too far north",
    "to river canals, Manayunk Reach, its towpath,",
    "mules and barges and anthracite from Point Carbon",
    "to feed stoves and Bessemers in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh",
    "Downriver, behind the boats and finny tracks:",
    "League Island, where cheats and pimply teens parked",
    "and tricked fingers through nipple hairs, satiny tufts,",
    "the shut-down Navy Yard, once staggering shore leave",
    "for so many thousands dead, how many more since,",
    "in the rivers, of the rivers, like the girl",
    "at a bend near the Museum gazebo: she tips",
    "a throe of ashes from a brassy urn,",
    "kneeling, not pious, just there, slanting her head",
    "as if to speak to the passing, do it right,",
    "shrug fine ores into the river\u2014it takes so long",
    "to cast away so little left of kin or friend",
    "to Schuylkill, Delaware, Chesapeake, Atlantic,"

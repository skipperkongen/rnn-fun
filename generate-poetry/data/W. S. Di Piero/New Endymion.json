    "of fir needles, mango, mold: I still get lost",
    "knowing she\u2019s close, me not getting younger",
    "or more conscious. Sometimes I fantasticate",
    "I\u2019m broad awake: her witchy presence waits",
    "for me to jump into her arms, but then she\u2019s just",
    "an incoherent ache in sleep\u2019s freaked scenes.",
    "I feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wrists",
    "vaporing nooses around my head and feet",
    "and genitals, conjuring my drab hair",
    "into a party bowl of oiled, desirable locks.",
    "She makes me nervous, but what would I do",
    "without her? So long as I can\u2019t have her,",
    "I want her and this alarming manic frequency.",
    "Then again, who wants to wake to change,",
    "its pulped, smelly suit of meat, drawing flies?",
    "My night-watch hot girl, moon-maiden, mom,",
    "let me get just one night\u2019s sleep without regret,",
    "released from your foxy ticklish fondlings,",
    "your latest smell of windblown fresh-cut grass."

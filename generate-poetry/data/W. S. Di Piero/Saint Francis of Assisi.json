    "The plain\u2019s hatching now",
    "after rainless months.",
    "A dust devil rips",
    "through a peach orchard",
    "down there, a seam snuffed",
    "by falling dust-fruit.",
    "Behind the vine rows\u2019",
    "shriveled abundance",
    "a low fire runs",
    "ragged by the ditch,",
    "flaying the pale sod.",
    "The voided skins wave.",
    "September, thirsting,",
    "sings our Hosannah,",
    "shrieks red poverties",
    "to old heaven\u2019s eye.",
    "* * *",
    "You want February? Snow and sleet came down hard,",
    "heaven\u2019s post-Christmas gift to freeze our eyelids shut.",
    "Walking the icy ground, our shoes all shot with holes,",
    "we did the Alexander\u2019s Army Ragtime Dance,",
    "stomping snow off bones safely packed in newspapers.",
    "From down below, we must have looked crazy happy,",
    "dancing like Hollywood Indians, though who had",
    "anything to eat? We dreamed lard. So the wolves came,",
    "not straight into town, not into the piazza,",
    "but near the outcrop behind the church. God\u2019s design,",
    "the best, the way they study the tired world",
    "makes them next to human, or more. They\u2019re waiting",
    "while they move. I\u2019d worship that expectancy.",
    "If I could talk to one, just a few minutes,",
    "he\u2019d teach me hunger\u2019s secrets. So one awful night",
    "I wrapped my legs and feet, stuffed more papers inside",
    "my pants and shirt, then danced my way behind the church.",
    "Faint gray writing on the snow. Skin and bones, sneezes,",
    "frost feathers, drifting away. Two of them walked back,",
    "canny bigshot archbishop warrior types. They said:",
    "The moon\u2019s blue, we know you want secrets, help, advice,",
    "news from this side. Our truth is: Forget likenesses,",
    "live inside your carbon soul, the moon\u2019s black and blue,",
    "in the soul\u2019s time the world\u2019s one winter together.",
    "* * *",
    "The snowy poplar seeds are everywhere,",
    "balling against curbs and car wheels,",
    "sifting through gates, doorways, kitchen windows,",
    "snagged by white blossoms shaken loose",
    "from the nodding horse-chestnut leaves. We stand",
    "in their shadows\u2014our springtime\u2019s dark.",
    "The debris scrapes our cheeks, clings an instant",
    "to our lashes, chokes the soft breath",
    "before tumbling off the near precipice.",
    "We want divine uncertainty.",
    "O give us the Judas tree\u2019s blood shadows,",
    "make us sick with rank pear blossoms,",
    "blind us with earth\u2019s random pieces engorged",
    "with broom\u2019s milky fallen-sun flesh."

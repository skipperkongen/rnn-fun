    "rumdumb from last night\u2019s shrubbery tryst",
    "exhales soot, fernseed, shoots and vines,",
    "brings his hot breath from the city park\u2019s wood,",
    "saying a song we don\u2019t understand",
    "through the briar and bay leaves of his beard.",
    "And in Philadelphia, 1954,",
    "out of late autumn\u2019s darkening he came,",
    "a junkman lugging a Penn Fruit cart,",
    "straw bristling his face, crying a name.",
    "Or from manholes in other cities,",
    "his holographic ectoplasm greets us",
    "when traffic lights turn green.",
    "Uncover and there he is, membranous",
    "Caliban alone with sewer rats,",
    "or stumblebum Puck, unnameable solids",
    "crusting nails and toes, bringing us his dark.",
    "Or our neighborhood\u2019s soused John-John,",
    "cobra down-at-heel boots skidding",
    "at my feet among the maddening jasmine,",
    "when I grab too late to save him growls:",
    "\u201cI can save you darling pigs.",
    "Behold, behold, and maybe I\u2019ll help.\u201d"

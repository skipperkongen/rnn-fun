    "Trying to find my roost",
    "one lidded, late afternoon,",
    "the consolation of color",
    "worked up like neediness,",
    "like craving chocolate,",
    "I\u2019m at Art Institute favorites:",
    "Velasquez\u2019s \u201cServant,\u201d",
    "her bashful attention fixed",
    "to place things just right,",
    "Beckmann\u2019s \u201cSelf-Portrait,\u201d",
    "whose fishy fingers seem",
    "never to do a day\u2019s work,",
    "the great stone lions outside",
    "monumentally pissed",
    "by jumbo wreaths and ribbons",
    "municipal good cheer",
    "yoked around their heads.",
    "Mealy mist. Furred air.",
    "I walk north across",
    "the river, Christmas lights",
    "crushed on skyscraper glass,",
    "bling stringing Michigan Ave.,",
    "sunlight\u2019s last-gasp sighing",
    "through the artless fog.",
    "Vague fatigued promise hangs",
    "in the low darkened sky",
    "when bunched scrawny starlings",
    "rattle up from trees,",
    "switchback and snag",
    "like tossed rags dressing",
    "the bare wintering branches,",
    "black-on-black shining,",
    "and I\u2019m in a moment",
    "more like a fore-moment:",
    "from the sidewalk, watching them",
    "poised without purpose,",
    "I feel lifted inside the common",
    "hazards and orders of things",
    "when from their stillness,",
    "the formal, aimless, not-waiting birds",
    "erupt again, clap, elated weather-",
    "making wing-clouds changing,",
    "smithereened back and forth,",
    "now already gone to follow",
    "the river\u2019s running course."

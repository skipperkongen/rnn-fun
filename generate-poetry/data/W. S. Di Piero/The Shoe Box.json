    "A high school mash note\u2019s stammering lust.",
    "Father and me, shirts and ties, snapshot glare,",
    "and somehow graphed into that air",
    "a young man\u2019s foolscap poem when a just,",
    "loose joinery of words was all that mattered.",
    "But then in last night\u2019s dream, she (mother, wife,",
    "mash note\u2019s love?) tells me a box holding secret life",
    "has been shipped, enclosing sounds I haven\u2019t heard:",
    "a wind-harp\u2019s warp, words yarding across staves,",
    "fluty sounds ribboned to sad, screechy tunes.",
    "And things: a wishbone, ring, whatever I crave,",
    "the heart-hollows, the cannot-do-withouts, the whens",
    "and whos, the frayed veils between death and here...",
    "I packed this box myself. I packed it full of fear."

    "From my window",
    "I watch the roots of a willow",
    "push your house crooked,",
    "women rummage through boxes,",
    "your sons cart away the TV, its cord",
    "trailing like your useless arms.",
    "Only weeks ago we watched the heavyweights,",
    "and between rounds you pummeled the air,",
    "drank whiskey, admonished \u201cKnow your competition!\u201d",
    "You did, Kansas, the \u201820s",
    "when you measured the town champ",
    "as he danced the same dance over and over:",
    "left foot, right lead, head down,",
    "the move you\u2019d dreamt about for days.",
    "Then right on cue your hay-bale uppercut",
    "compressed his spine. You know. That was that.",
    "Now your mail piles up, RESIDENT circled",
    "\u201cnot here.\u201d Your lawn goes to seed. Dandelions",
    "burst in the wind. From my window",
    "I see you flat on your back on some canvas,",
    "above you a wrinkled face, its clippy bow tie",
    "bobbing toward ten. There\u2019s someone behind you,",
    "resting easy against the ropes,",
    "a last minute substitute on the card you knew",
    "so well, vaguely familiar, taken for granted,",
    "with a sucker punch you don\u2019t remember",
    "ever having seen."

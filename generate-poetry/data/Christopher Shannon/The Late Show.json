    "that lingers beneath the kitchen table,",
    "while cigarette smoke, shapeless and unstable,",

    "while the road nearby, through the window,",
    "flickers with the credits of the late late show,",
    "and in a clamshell bowl the clementines",
    "lacquer the air with the citrus of rinds,",
    "knuckled open as you gazed wide-eyed",
    "at bills with the words balance due inside."

    "I once rejoiced, sweet evening gale,",

    "I to thy rays prefer deep gloom, \u2014",
    "Since now, alas! I see them beam",
    "Upon my Henry\u2019s lonely tomb.",
    "Sweet evening gale, howe\u2019er I seem,",
    "I wish thee o\u2019er my sod to wave;",
    "Ah! setting sun! soon mayst thou beam",
    "On mine, as well as Henry\u2019s grave!"

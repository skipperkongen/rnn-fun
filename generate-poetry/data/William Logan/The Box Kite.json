    "The lift, the very lift and pull of it!",
    "They\u2019d wasted the summer morning,",
    "father and son in the devil\u2019s",
    "breath of July\u2014gnats wheeling",
    "madly above the drive\u2014pasting Sunday comics",
    "across the struts, like the canvas skin",
    "of a Sopwith Camel. Into the close-gnawn yard",
    "with its humpback boulder,",
    "they dragged it triumphantly, unreeling the twine",
    "until the contraption yanked itself",
    "from bald earth, high above",
    "the matchbox houses on the verge",
    "of woods and the sweet-smelling bog,",
    "to a height where a boy might peer over the horizon",
    "to Boston\u2014and beyond, the ocean.",
    "The son was my father. I tottered at his legs,",
    "having borrowed his name and my grandfather\u2019s.",
    "They payed out the ramshackle affair",
    "until it became a postage stamp. The line",
    "burned a bloody groove into my palms,",
    "the last time they stood at ease with each other."

    "The ship at anchor wasn\u2019t what it seemed\u2014",

    "(The dream of life is just another dream.)",
    "It soared above the masts, canals, the steam",
    "of chimneys, till our Punch was just a speck.",
    "The ship at anchor wasn\u2019t what it seemed,",
    "the harbor, Venice, Europe\u2014even the gleam",
    "blazing San Marco\u2019s horses shrank. A fleck!",
    "The dream of life is just another dream",
    "that really wants a king, a god\u2019s regime,",
    "or some poor hurricane to wreck",
    "the ship at anchor. Wasn\u2019t what it seemed,",
    "Punch\u2019s old life, another Ponzi scheme?",
    "Weren\u2019t sailors waving from the quarter-deck?",
    "The dream of life is just another dream",
    "that none of us will live to see redeemed.",
    "Death scrawls his bold John Hancock on your check.",
    "The ship at anchor wasn\u2019t what it seemed.",
    "The dream of life is just another dream."

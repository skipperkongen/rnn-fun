    "Along the campo, Manin\u2019s bronze winged lion prowled",
    "among the tanned intruders, licking their hands.",
    "Pools of iridescent shellfish",
    "lay open in the restaurant window,",
    "a shop of otherworldly opals, the mussels\u2019 sheen",
    "the skies of a closed heaven, crabs flat on their backs,",
    "their armor intricate trapped plates and escapements.",
    "The squid slumped in its own ink, the octopus appalled",
    "in its slime. Many and ingenious are the postures of death.",
    "But look! There, in a corner, beneath a willowware plate,",
    "a lone crab clicked its claws, creeping",
    "over a casket of walleyed fish,",
    "through a valley of oysters keeping their counsel,",
    "only to shift warily under the shadow of a wine bottle.",
    "Which saint, O saints, watches over the saintly crab?",
    "The man of forks and spears, the man of arrows?",
    "In the Ca\u2019 d\u2019Oro, the stiffened Sebastian takes",
    "each arrow through his flesh like a skewer.",
    "He wears a little napkin around his middle.",
    "Saint, watch over the fragile boat of the runaway crab.",
    "Let him steal his way back to the green lagoon,",
    "go floating down the Grand Canal on his own",
    ".",
    "Let him take second life, a later martyrdom.",
    "Let him wave his bent claws in a mockery of farewell,",
    "lest we eat in his hollow shell his captive meat."

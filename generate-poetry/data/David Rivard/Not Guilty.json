    "The days are dog-eared, the edges torn,",
    "ragged\u2014like those pages",
    "I ripped once out of library books,",
    "for their photos",
    "of Vallejo and bootless Robert Johnson.",
    "A fine needs paying now",
    "it\u2019s true, but",
    "not by me.",
    "I am no more guilty",
    "than that thrush is",
    "who sits there stripping moss",
    "off the wet bark of a tree.",
    "A red fleck, like his, glows",
    "at the back of my head\u2014a beauty mark,",
    "left by the brain\u2019s after-jets.",
    "I would not wish for the three brains",
    "Robert required",
    "to double-clutch his guitar",
    "and chase those sounds he had to know",
    "led down",
    "and into a troubled dusky river, always.",
    "Three brains did Johnson no earthly good,",
    "neither his nor Vallejo\u2019s 4 & 1/2",
    "worked right exactly\u2014O bunglers,",
    "O banged-up pans of disaster!",
    "Crying for days, said Cesar, & singing for months.",
    "How can I be so strong some times,",
    "at others weak? I wish to be free,",
    "but free to do what? To leave myself behind?",
    "To switch channels remotely?",
    "Better to sing.",
    "Not like the bird, but as they sang,",
    "Cesar & Robert\u2014",
    "with the shocked & seeded",
    "sweetness of an apple",
    "split open by a meat cleaver."

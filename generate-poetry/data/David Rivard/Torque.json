    "After his ham & cheese in the drape factory cafeteria,",
    "having slipped by the bald shipping foreman",
    "to ride a rattling elevator to the attic",
    "where doves flicker into the massive eaves",
    "and where piled boxes of out-of-style",
    "cotton and lace won\u2019t ever be",
    "decorating anyone\u2019s sun parlor windows.",
    "Having dozed off in that hideout he fixed",
    "between five four-by-six cardboard storage cartons",
    "while the rest of us pack Mediterranean Dreams",
    "and Colonial Ruffles and drapes colored like moons,",
    "and he wakes lost\u2014",
    "shot through",
    "into a world of unlocked unlocking light\u2014",
    "suddenly he knows where he is and feels half nuts",
    "and feels like killing some pigeons with a slingshot.",
    "That\u2019s all, and that\u2019s why he pokes",
    "his calloused fingers into the broken machinery,",
    "hunting for loose nuts a half inch wide\u2014",
    "five greasy cold ones that warm in his pocket\u2014",
    "and yanks back the snag-cut strip of inner tube",
    "with a nut snug at the curve to snap it",
    "at the soft chest of a dopey bird.",
    "Then the noise of pigeons flopping down",
    "to creosoted hardwood, and then a grin",
    "the guy gives me & all his other pals later.",
    "And afternoon tightens down on all",
    "our shoulders, until the shift whistle",
    "blasts, blowing through the plant like air",
    "through lace. As it always has, as it does.",
    "That bright. That stunned."

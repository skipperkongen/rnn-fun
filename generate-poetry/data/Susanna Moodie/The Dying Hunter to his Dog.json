    "Lie down\u2014lie down!\u2014my noble hound,",
    "That joyful bark give o\u2019er;",
    "It wakes the lonely echoes round,",
    "But rouses me no more\u2014",
    "Thy lifted ears, thy swelling chest,",
    "Thy eyes so keenly bright,",
    "No longer kindle in my breast",
    "The thrill of fierce delight;",
    "When following thee on foaming steed",
    "My eager soul outstripped thy speed\u2014",
    "Lie down\u2014lie down\u2014my faithful hound!",
    "And watch this night by me,",
    "For thee again the horn shall sound",
    "By mountain, stream, and tree;",
    "And thou along the forest glade,",
    "Shall track the flying deer",
    "When cold and silent, I am laid",
    "In chill oblivion here.",
    "Another voice shall cheer thee on,",
    "And glory when the chase is won.",
    "Lie down\u2014lie down!\u2014my gallant hound!",
    "Thy master\u2019s life is sped;",
    "Go\u2014couch thee on the dewy ground\u2014",
    "\u2019Tis thine to watch the dead.",
    "But when the blush of early day",
    "Is kindling up the sky,",
    "Then speed thee, faithful friend, away,",
    "And to thy mistress hie;",
    "And guide her to this lonely spot,",
    "Though my closed eyes behold her not\u2014",
    "Lie down\u2014lie down!\u2014my trusty hound!",
    "Death comes, and we must part\u2014",
    "In my dull ear strange murmurs sound\u2014",
    "More faintly throbs my heart;",
    "The many twinkling lights of heaven",
    "Scarce glimmer in the blue\u2014",
    "Chill round me falls the breath of even,",
    "Cold on my brow the dew;",
    "Earth, stars, and heavens, are lost to sight\u2014",
    "The chase is o\u2019er!\u2014brave friend, good night!\u2014"

    "Well I recall my Father\u2019s wife,",
    "The day he brought her home.",
    "His children looked for years of strife,",
    "And troubles sure to come\u2014",
    "Ungraciously we welcomed her,",
    "A thing to scorn and blame;",
    "And swore we never would confer",
    "On her, a Mother\u2019s name",
    "I see her yet\u2014a girl in years,",
    "With eyes so blue and mild;",
    "She greeted us with smiles and tears,",
    "How sweetly too she smiled\u2014",
    "She bent to kiss my sullen brow,",
    "With woman\u2019s gentle grace;",
    "And laid her tiny hand of snow",
    "On my averted face\u2014",
    "\u201cHenry\u2014is this your son? She said\u2014",
    "\u201cDear boy\u2014he now is mine\u2014",
    "What not one kiss?\u2014\u201d I shook my head,",
    "\u201cI am no son of thine!\u2014\u201d",
    "She sighed\u2014and from her dimpled cheek",
    "The rosy colour fled;",
    "She turned away and did not speak,",
    "My thoughts were with the dead\u2014",
    "There leaped from out my Father\u2019s eyes",
    "A jet of swarthy fire;",
    "That flashed on me in fierce surprise\u2014",
    "I fled before his ire",
    "I heard her gentle voice entreat\u2014",
    "\u201cForgiveness for her sake\u201d\u2014",
    "Which added swiftness to my feet,",
    "A sad and strange mistake\u2014",
    "A year had scarcely rolled away",
    "When by that hated bride;",
    "I loved to linger half the day,",
    "In very joy and pride;",
    "Her voice was music to mine ear,",
    "So soft its accent fell;",
    "\u201cDear Mother now\u201d\u2014and oh, how dear",
    "No words of mine can tell\u2014",
    "She was so gentle, fair and kind,",
    "So pure in soul and free from art;",
    "That woman with her noble mind,",
    "Subdued my rebel heart\u2014",
    "I just had learned to know her worth,",
    "My Father\u2019s second choice to bless;",
    "When God removed her from the earth,",
    "And plunged us all in deep distress\u2014",
    "Hot fever smote with burning blight",
    "Stretchd on a restless bed of pain;",
    "I moaning lay from morn till night",
    "With aching limbs and throbbing brain\u2014",
    "Four weary weeks beside my bed,",
    "She sat within a darkened room;",
    "Untiring held my aching head,",
    "Nor heeded silence\u2014cold and gloom\u2014",
    "And when my courage quite gave way,",
    "And fainter grew my struggling breath;",
    "She taught my stricken soul to pray",
    "And calmly meet approaching death\u2014",
    "\u201cFear not God\u2019s angel, sent by Him,",
    "The weary spirit to release;",
    "Before the mortal eyes grow dim,",
    "Floats down the white winged dove of peace\u201d\u2014",
    "There came a change\u2014but fingers small,",
    "No longer smoothed my matted hair;",
    "She sprang not to my feeble call,",
    "Nor helped to lift me to my chair\u2014",
    "And I arose as from the dead,",
    "A life for her dear life was given;",
    "The angel who had watched my bed",
    "Had vanished into Heaven!\u2014"

    "Enchanting spirit!\u2014at thy votive shrine",
    "I lowly bend a simple wreath to twine;",
    "O Come from the ideal world and fling",
    "Thy airy fingers o\u2019er my rugged string;",
    "Sweep the dark chords of thought and give to earth",
    "The thrilling song that tells thy heavenly birth\u2014",
    "Happiness when from earth she fled",
    "I passed on her heavenward flight\u2014",
    "\u201cTake this crown,\u201d the spirit said",
    "\u201cOf heaven\u2019s own golden light\u2014",
    "To the sons of sorrow the token give,",
    "And bid them follow my steps and live!\u201d\u2014",
    "I took the crown from the snowy hand,",
    "It flashed like a living star;",
    "I turned this dark earth to a fairy land",
    "When I hither drive my car;",
    "But I placed the crown round my tresses bright,",
    "And man only saw its reflected light\u2014",
    "Many a lovely dream I\u2019ve given,",
    "And many a song divine;",
    "But never!\u2014oh never\u2014that gift of heaven",
    "Shall mortals temples twine\u2014",
    "Hope and love in the circlet glow!",
    "\u2019Tis all too bright for a world of woe\u2014",
    "Hist\u2014Beautiful spirit!\u2014why silent so soon?",
    "My ear drinks each word of thy magical tune;",
    "My lyre owns thy touch\u2014and its tremulous strings",
    "Vibrate beneath the soft play of thy wings;",
    "Resume thy sweet lay, and reveal, ere we part",
    "Thy home lovely spirit\u2014and say what thou art?\u201d\u2014",
    "The gleam of a star thou cans\u2019t not see\u2014",
    "Of an eye \u2019neath its sleeping lid,",
    "The sound of a far off melody",
    "The voice of a stream that\u2019s hid;",
    "Such must I still remain to thee",
    "A wonder and a mystery!\u2014",
    "I live in the poet\u2019s dream",
    "I flash on the painter\u2019s eye;",
    "I dwell in the moon\u2019s pale beam,",
    "In the depths of the star lit sky;",
    "I traverse the earth, the air, the main,",
    "And bind young hearts in my magic chain\u2014",
    "I float on the fleecy cloud",
    "My voice is in ev\u2019ry breeze;",
    "I speak in the tempest loud,",
    "In the sigh of the waving trees\u2014",
    "To the sons of earth\u2014in a mystic tone,",
    "I tell of a world more bright than their own!\u2014"

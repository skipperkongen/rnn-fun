    "Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish,",
    "and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim.",
    "But early this spring two Canada geese",
    "lingered, then built a nest. What I\u2019d",
    "heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings,",
    "as they paddle about, grabbed from below",
    "by a snapper, pulled down to drown.",
    "So he stuck",
    "hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks",
    "attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys.",
    "The first week he caught three turtles",
    "and still there are more: sometimes he finds",
    "the bottles dragged ashore, the wire",
    "wrapped several times around a pine trunk",
    "and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin."

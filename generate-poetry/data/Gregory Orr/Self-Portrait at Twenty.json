    "I stood inside myself",
    "like a dead tree or a tower.",
    "I pulled the rope",
    "of braided hair",
    "and high above me",
    "a bell of leaves tolled.",
    "Because my hand",
    "stabbed its brother,",
    "I said: Make it stone.",
    "Because my tongue",
    "spoke harshly, I said:",
    "Make it dust.",
    "And yet",
    "it was not death, but",
    "her body in its green dress",
    "I longed for. That\u2019s why",
    "I stood for days in the field",
    "until the grass turned black",
    "and the rain came."

    "I felt both pleasure and a shiver",
    "as we undressed on the slippery bank",
    "and then plunged into the wild river.",
    "I waded in; she entered as a diver.",
    "Watching her pale flanks slice the dark",
    "I felt both pleasure and a shiver.",
    "Was this a source of the lake we sought, giver",
    "of itself to that vast, blue expanse?",
    "We\u2019d learn by plunging into the wild river",
    "and letting the current take us wherever",
    "it willed. I had that yielding to thank",
    "for how I felt both pleasure and a shiver.",
    "But what she felt and saw I\u2019ll never",
    "know: separate bodies taking the same risk",
    "by plunging together into the wild river.",
    "Later, past the rapids, we paused to consider",
    "if chance or destiny had brought us here;",
    "whether it was more than pleasure and a shiver",
    "we\u2019d found by plunging into the wild river."

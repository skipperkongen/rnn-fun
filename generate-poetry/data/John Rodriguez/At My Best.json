    "August is the cruelest month: never enough daylight, too much",
    "heat, no holidays and nothing matters except September\u2019s",
    "Caulfield, summer camp senior counselor for the junior trail",
    "and third grade. Nothing is as positive, as motivating a force within",
    "radio station blazing hip-hop and R&B. (Imagine this cherubic",
    "Have you ever ridden in a cheesebus with ashy children asleep",
    "windows \u2014 blurring along the highways like confusion giving way",
    "to doubt, the heady smell of dried chlorine and musty towels",
    "lulling you into the soft timbre of a Midwest falsetto? Tell me",
    "what it is to fall in love with a lightskin girl covering the Isley",
    "Brothers. I was not two weeks into 21 years old. I had yet",
    "to wear a box cutter in my fifth pocket, or see a semi-automatic",
    "aimed at my center mass, to feel its dumbness against my spine.",
    "My life was uncertain, save for its unlikely length under my control,",
    "like the pilot who falls short of what he says, what he says",
    "he\u2019s all about, all about. All my homeboys were still alive, just",
    "like Aaliyah Dana Haughton, not yet an angel of the cruelest August,",
    "begging a boy, who may not be in the mood to learn what he thinks",
    "he knows, to look beyond his world and try to find a place for her."

    "Would but indulgent Fortune send",
    "To me a kind, and faithful Friend,",
    "One who to Virtue\u2019s Laws is true,",
    "And does her nicest Rules pursue;",
    "One Pious, Lib\u2019ral, Just and Brave,",
    "And to his Passions not a Slave;",
    "Who full of Honour, void of Pride,",
    "Will freely praise, and freely chide;",
    "But not indulge the smallest Fault,",
    "Nor entertain one slighting Thought:",
    "Who still the same will ever prove,",
    "Will still instruct and still will love:",
    "In whom I safely may confide,",
    "And with him all my Cares divide:",
    "Who has a large capacious Mind,",
    "Join\u2019d with a Knowledge unconfin\u2019d:",
    "A Reason bright, a Judgement true,",
    "A Wit both quick, and solid too:",
    "Who can of all things talk with Ease,",
    "And whose Converse will ever please:",
    "Who charm\u2019d with Wit, and inward Graces,",
    "Despises Fools with tempting Faces;",
    "And still a beauteous Mind does prize",
    "Above the most enchanting Eyes:",
    "I would not envy Queens their State,",
    "Nor once desire a happier Fate."

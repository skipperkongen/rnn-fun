    "Why,",
    ", why, why, why so pressing?",
    "The Heart you beg\u2019s not worth possessing:",
    "Each Look, each Word, each Smile\u2019s affected,",
    "And inward Charms are quite neglected:",
    "Then scorn her, scorn her, foolish Swain,",
    "And sigh no more, no more in vain.",
    "Beauty\u2019s worthless, fading, flying;",
    "Who would for Trifles think of dying?",
    "Who for a Face, a Shape, wou\u2019d languish,",
    "And tell the Brooks, and Groves his Anguish,",
    "Till she, till she thinks fit to prize him,",
    "And all, and all beside despise him?",
    "Fix, fix your Thoughts on what\u2019s inviting,",
    "On what will never bear the slighting:",
    "Wit and Virtue claim your Duty,",
    "They\u2019re much more worth than Gold and Beauty:",
    "To them, to them, your Heart resign,",
    "And you\u2019ll no more, no more repine."

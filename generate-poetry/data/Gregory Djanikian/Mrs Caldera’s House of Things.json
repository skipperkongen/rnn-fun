    "You are sitting in Mrs. Caldera\u2019s kitchen,",
    "you are sipping a glass of lemonade",
    "and trying not to be too curious about",
    "the box of plastic hummingbirds behind you,",
    "the tray of tineless forks at your elbow.",
    "You have heard about the backroom",
    "where no one else has ever gone",
    "and whatever enters, remains,",
    "refrigerator doors, fused coils,",
    "mower blades, milk bottles, pistons, gears.",
    "\u201cYou never know,\u201d she says, rummaging",
    "through a cedar chest of recipes,",
    "\u201cwhen something will come of use.\u201d",
    "There is a vase of pencil tips on the table,",
    "a bowl full of miniature wheels and axles.",
    "Upstairs, where her children slept,",
    "the doors will not close,",
    "the stacks of magazines are burgeoning,",
    "there are snow shoes and lampshades,",
    "bedsprings and picture tubes,",
    "and boxes and boxes of irreducibles!",
    "You imagine the headline in the",
    "House Founders Under Weight Of Past.",
    "But Mrs Caldera is baking cookies,",
    "she is humming a song from childhood,",
    "her arms are heavy and strong,",
    "they have held babies, a husband,",
    "tractor parts and gas tanks,",
    "what have they not found a place for?",
    "It is getting dark, you have sat for a long time.",
    "If you move, you feel something will be disturbed,",
    "there is room enough only for your body.",
    "\u201cStay awhile,\u201d Mrs. Caldera says,",
    "and never have you felt so valuable."

    "My wife tells me she hears a beetle",
    "Scurrying across the kitchen floor.",
    "She says our daughter is dreaming",
    "Too loudly, just listen, her eyelids",
    "Are fluttering like butterflies.",
    "What about the thunder, I say,",
    "What about the dispatches from the police car",
    "Parked outside, or me rolling over like a whale?",
    "She tells me there\u2019s a leaf falling",
    "And grazing the downstairs window,",
    "Or it could be glass cutters, diamonds,",
    "Thieves working their hands toward the latch.",
    "She tells me our son is breathing too quickly,",
    "Is it pneumonia, is it the furnace",
    "Suddenly pumping monoxides through the house?",
    "So when my wife says",
    ", she means",
    "A closing of the eyes, a tuning",
    "Of the ears to ultra frequencies.",
    "(It is what always happens",
    "When there are children, the bed",
    "Becoming at night a listening post,",
    "Each little",
    "forewarning disaster.)",
    "Downstairs there is the sound",
    "Of something brushing against something else",
    "And I try to listen as my wife might listen,",
    "Insects, I say, dust on a table top,",
    "Maybe a knife\u2019s edge against the palm.",
    "But she tells me it\u2019s only",
    "The African violet on the windowsill",
    "Putting out another flower,",
    "And falls luxuriously into a dream",
    "Of being awake and vigilant.",
    "So the house grows noisier,",
    "There are clicks in the woodwork,",
    "There are drips, raps, clunks, things",
    "To make sense of, make benign.",
    "My son and daughter are sleeping calmly,",
    "And the stairs, yes, are creaking,",
    "The wind, I think, or maybe two men,",
    "Where\u2019s the beaker of acid,",
    "The bowling ball, the war hoop",
    "I learned in second grade?",
    "So this is what it\u2019s like when there\u2019s",
    "No one left but you to love and defend.",
    "Outside there are cats in a fight",
    "And they remind me too much of babies crying.",
    "Then the bottle thrown against the stoop,",
    "The sound of something delicate shattered.",
    "My wife stirs, Be glad, she says,",
    "Sound doesn\u2019t carry far, that you don\u2019t hear",
    "The whole of it, cries in the night,",
    "Children in other cities, hurts, silences.",
    "And she\u2019s right, I can\u2019t hear the whole of it,",
    "Or else I hear too much and it\u2019s noise",
    "Or I make it noise because it\u2019s too much.",
    "So I begin homing in on something",
    "Around me, something distinct, my wife\u2019s",
    "Breathing, a window\u2019s rattle. Outside,",
    "Grass is lengthening in the dark,",
    "And sap running up the phloem of the maple,",
    "(Do I hear it? And how the stars must be wheeling!)",
    "And in the far room, my children\u2019s",
    "Hearts are keeping time, for them, for us",
    "Who have begun to listen in earnest."

    "The rugs had been rolled up and islands of them",
    "Floated in the centers of every room,",
    "And now, on the bare wood floors,",
    "My sister and I were skimming among them",
    "In the boats we\u2019d made from newspaper,",
    "Sheets of them pinned to each other,",
    "Dhows, gondolas, clippers, arks.",
    "There was a mule outside on the street",
    "Braying under a load of figs, though mostly",
    "There was quiet, a wind from the desert",
    "Was putting the city to sleep,",
    "But we were too far adrift, the air",
    "Was scurfy and wet, the currents tricking",
    "Our bows against reef and coral",
    "And hulls shearing under the weight of cargo.",
    "\u201cAhoy and belay!\u201d I called to my sister,",
    "\u201cAvast, avast!\u201d she yelled back from her rigging,",
    "And neither of us knew what we were saying",
    "But the words came to us as from a movie,",
    "Cinemascopic, American. \u201cRichard Widmark,\u201d",
    "I said. \u201cClark Gable, Bogie,\u201d she said,",
    "\u201cYo-ho-ho.\u201d We had passed Cyprus",
    "And now there was Crete or Sardinia",
    "Maybe something larger further off.",
    "The horizon was everywhere I turned,",
    "The waters were becoming turgid,",
    "They were roiling, weeks had passed.",
    "\u201cAmerica, America, land-ho!\u201d I yelled directionless.",
    "\u201cGibraltar,\u201d my sister said, \u201cHeave to,\u201d",
    "And signalling a right, her arm straight out,",
    "She turned and bravely set our course",
    "North-by-northwest for the New World.",
    "Did we arrive? Years later, yes.",
    "By plane, suddenly. With suitcases",
    "And something as hazy as a future.",
    "The November sun was pale and far off,",
    "The air was colder than we\u2019d ever felt,",
    "And already these were wonders to us",
    "As much as snow would be or evergreens,",
    "And it would take me a long time",
    "Before I\u2019d ever remember",
    "Boats made of paper, islands of wool,",
    "And my sister\u2019s voice, as in a fog,",
    "Calling out the hazards,",
    "Leading me on, getting us there."

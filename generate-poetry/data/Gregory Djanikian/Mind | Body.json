    "How do they survive, riven",

    "sensualist by pool side or in bed,",
    "doesn't it hear the mind's",
    "impatient machinery ticking",
    "And only in our mind's eye,",
    "as we're fond of saying,",
    "someone else's body leaping nimbly",
    "in",

    "to us Act V, scene iii",
    "in one gestural flourish,",
    "body and mind beautifully",
    "synchronous.",
    "Oh, the mind is eely, slipping",
    "out of its puzzle boxes,",
    "loving its own wit.",
    "And the earnest body: speak of it",
    "with the least irony, and already",
    "you've begun to unnerve it.",
    "Better to let them have their way,",
    "forgetting about them both",
    "until they meet again sometime",
    "as if for the first time",
    "in library or steam room",
    "ready to shake",
    "or lead you to whatever door there is",
    "and always the two sets of stairs."

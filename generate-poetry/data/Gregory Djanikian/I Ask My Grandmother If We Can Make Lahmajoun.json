    "Sure, she says, why not,",
    "we buy the ground lamb from the market",
    "we buy parsley, fresh tomatoes, garlic",
    "we cut, press, dice, mix",
    "make the yeasty dough",
    "the night before, kneading it",
    "until our knuckles feel the hardness",
    "of river beds or rocks in the desert",
    "we tell Tante Lola to come",
    "with her rolling pins we tell",
    "Zaven and Maroush, Hagop and Arpin\u00e9",
    "to bring their baking sheets",
    "we sprinkle the flour on the kitchen table",
    "and it is snowing on Ararat",
    "we sprinkle the flour and the memory",
    "of winter is in our eyes",
    "we roll the dough out",
    "into small circles",
    "pale moons over",
    "every empty village",
    "Kevork is standing on a chair",
    "and singing",
    "Nevrig is warming the oven",
    "and a dry desert breeze",
    "is skimming over the rooftops",
    "toward the sea",
    "we are spreading the",
    "on the",
    "with our fingers",
    "whispering into it the histories",
    "of those who have none",
    "we are baking them",
    "under the heat of the sun",
    "the dough crispening",
    "so thin and delicate",
    "you would swear",
    "it is valuable parchment",
    "we are taking out",
    "and rolling up in our hands",
    "and eating and tasting again",
    "everything that has already",
    "been written",
    "into the body."

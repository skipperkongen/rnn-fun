    "We have been cruising, half a block",
    "at a time, my wife, my two children,",
    "all morning, and I have been pointing out",
    "unhurriedly and with some feeling",
    "places of consequence, sacred places,",
    "backyards, lush fields, garages, alleyways.",
    "\u201cThere,\u201d I say, \u201cby this big cottonwood,",
    "That\u2019s where I dropped the fly ball, 1959.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd in 1961,\u201d I say, \u201cat this very corner,",
    "Barry Sapolsky tripped me up with his gym bag.\u201d",
    "My son has fallen asleep, my daughter",
    "has been nodding \u201cyes\u201d indiscriminately",
    "for the last half hour, and my wife",
    "has the frozen, wide-eyed look of the undead.",
    "\u201cMaybe lunch,\u201d I say, though I\u2019m making now",
    "my fourth approach to Curtin Jr. High School,",
    "yellow-bricked, large-windowed, gothic,",
    "where Frank Marone preyed on our terror once",
    "and Janice Lehman walked in beauty.",
    "\u201cSalute, everyone,\u201d I say, \u201csalute,\u201d",
    "bringing my hand up to my brow as we pass",
    "the gilded entrance, \u201cThis is where things",
    "of importance happened,\u201d and I am pulling out",
    "from under the car seat a photo album",
    "of old school pictures, \u201cPage 8,\u201d I say,",
    "\u201cFred Decker, John Carlson by the bike rack,",
    "Mr. Burkett \u2026 ,\u201d and driving on, following",
    "the invisible map before my eyes.",
    "Now we are drifting toward my boyhood house",
    "and I am showing my wife trellised porches,",
    "bike routes, more than she\u2019d care to see;",
    "\u201cWhy this longing?\u201d she says, \u201cWhat about now,",
    "the kids, our lives together, lunch, me?\u201d",
    "I give her a kiss and turn right on Cherry",
    "and there in front of our eyes, barely changed,",
    "is the house where all my memories converge.",
    "\u201cLook at the windows of my room,\u201d I say,",
    "\u201csee, there, the shadowy figure moving behind them?\u201d",
    "And before anyone can hope to answer,",
    "I have grabbed my camera, I am snapping",
    "pictures through the windshield, bricks,",
    "dormers, railings, fences, streets, all",
    "are falling thrall to my aim.",
    "\u201cWe could be happy here,\u201d I say, putting",
    "another roll of film in and beginning",
    "to nose my car toward Bill Corson\u2019s house.",
    "\u201cReally, Daddy,\u201d my daughter says; \u201cNo chance,\u201d",
    "my wife tacks on, but all I\u2019m hearing",
    "is the crack of bats in the neighborhood lot",
    "and Danny\u2019s pearl-handled cap gun going off",
    "and the drone of bees around honeysuckle",
    "and Dewey Waugh\u2019s gravelly voice",
    "urging on his mower, and the sound",
    "of wind in the cottonwoods is like water,",
    "I am coasting, there is time for everything."

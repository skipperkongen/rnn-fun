    "The fields flame with it, endless, blue",
    "as cobra poison. It has entered our blood",
    "and pulses up our veins",
    "like night. There is no other color.",
    "The planter\u2019s whip",
    "splits open the flesh of our faces,",
    "a blue liquid light trickles",
    "through the fingers. Blue dyes the lungs",
    "when we breathe. Only the obstinate eyes",
    "parted the earth\u2019s moist skin",
    "and pushed up reed by reed,",
    "green, then rippled gold",
    "like the Arhiyal\u2019s waves. Stitched",
    "into our eyelids, the broken dark,",
    "the torches of the planter\u2019s men, fire",
    "walling like a tidal wave",
    "over our huts, ripe charred grain",
    "that smelled like flesh. And the wind",
    "screaming in the voices of women",
    "dragged to the plantation,",
    "feet, hair, torn breasts.",
    "their violent forever blue,",
    "in the dye, pack it in great embossed chests",
    "for the East India Company.",
    "Our ankles gleam thin blue from the chains.",
    "After that night",
    "many of the women killed themselves.",
    "Drowning was the easiest.",
    "Sometimes the Arhiyal gave us back",
    "the naked, swollen bodies, the faces",
    "eaten by fish. We hold on",
    "the marriage mark on their foreheads,",
    "we hold it carefully inside",
    "our blue skulls, like a man",
    "in the cold",
    "night",
    "holds in his cupped palms a spark,",
    "its welcome scorch,",
    "feeds it his foggy breath till he can set it down",
    "in the right place,",
    "to blaze up and burst",
    "like the hot heart of a star",
    "over the whole horizon,",
    "a burning so beautiful you want it",
    "to never end.",
    "British, who exported it as a cash crop for almost a hundred years until",
    "the peasant uprising of I860, when the plantations were destroyed."

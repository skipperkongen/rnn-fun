    "The sun-face looms over me, gigantic-hot, smelling",
    "of iron. Its rays striated,",
    "rasp-red and muscled as the tongues",
    "of iguanas. They are trying to lick away",
    "my name. But I",
    "am not afraid. I hold in my hands",
    "(where did I get them)",
    "enormous blue scissors that are",
    "just the color of sky. I bring",
    "the blades together, like",
    "a song. The rays fall around me",
    "curling a bit, like dried carrot peel. A far sound",
    "in the air\u2014fire",
    "or rain? And when I\u2019ve cut",
    "all the way to the center of the sun",
    "I see",
    "flowers, flowers, flowers."

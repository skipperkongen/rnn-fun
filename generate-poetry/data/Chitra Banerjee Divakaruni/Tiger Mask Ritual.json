    "When you put on the mask the thunder starts.",
    "Through the nostril\u2019s orange you can smell",
    "the far hope of rain. Up in the Nilgiris,",
    "glisten of eucalyptus, drip of pine, spiders tumbling",
    "from their silver webs.",
    "You finger the stripes ridged like weals",
    "out of your childhood. A wind is rising",
    "in the north, a scarlet light",
    "like a fire in the sky.",
    "Night gauzes you in black. You are blind",
    "as in the beginning of the world. Sniff. Seek the moon.",
    "After a while you will know",
    "that creased musky smell is rising",
    "from your skin.",
    "Your fur stiffens. A roar from the distant left,",
    "like monsoon water. You swivel your sightless head.",
    "Under your sheathed paw",
    "the ground shifts wet.",
    "sheltering in your skull",
    "against the circle that always closes in",
    "just before dawn?",
    "rain and a good harvest."

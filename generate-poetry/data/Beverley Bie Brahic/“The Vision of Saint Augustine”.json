    "You are amazed to find trees in Venice \u2014",
    "To turn a corner into a campo",
    "Where two or three rustling acacias",
    "Spread their halo of leaves",
    "Over two or three red-slatted benches.",
    "It\u2019s as if you had slipped through a curtained doorway",
    "Into a hall full of dull gold scenes",
    "By Carpaccio \u2014 a miraculous light \u2014",
    "Though the rio\u2019s still shrouded in a mist",
    "Compounded of water vapour and smog",
    "So it\u2019s not that the sun has come out, it\u2019s",
    "Something to do with the leaves and painting",
    "In the realm of echoes where footsteps",
    "Reverberate endlessly between two walls",
    "And dawn is the chink of a stonemason",
    "At his reparations, disembodied",
    "Voices irresistible as bird calls.",
    "Yes, you\u2019re amazed to find trees in Venice",
    "Shedding their gold leaf onto the pavement",
    "Outside a secondhand bookstore.",
    "It\u2019s like Carpaccio\u2019s little white dog",
    "Wagging his tail at the feet of Saint Augustine",
    "Who is staring out of the window",
    "Looking for the voice of Saint Jerome."

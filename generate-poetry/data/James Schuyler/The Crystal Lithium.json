    "The smell of snow, stinging in nostrils as the wind lifts it from a beach",
    "Eve-shuttering, mixed with sand, or when snow lies under the street lamps and on all",
    "And the air is emptied to an uplifting gassiness",
    "That turns lungs to winter waterwings, buoying, and the bright white night",
    "Freezes in sight a lapse of waves, balsamic, salty, unexpected:",
    "Hours after swimming, sitting thinking biting at a hangnail",
    "And the taste of the\u2014to your eyes\u2014invisible crystals irradiates the world",
    "\u201cThe sea is salt\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd so am I\u201d",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t bite your nails\u201d",
    "and the metal flavor of a nail\u2014are these brads?\u2014",
    "Taken with a slight spitting motion from between teeth and whanged into place",
    "(Boards and sawdust) and the nail set is ridged with cold",
    "Permanently as marble, always degrees cooler than the rooms of air it lies in",
    "Felt as you lay your cheek upon the counter on which sits a blue-banded cup",
    "A counter of condensed wintry exhalations glittering infinitesimally",
    "A promise, late on a broiling day in late September, of the cold kiss",
    "Of marble sheets to one who goes barefoot quickly in the snow and early",
    "Only so far as the ash can\u2014bang, dump\u2014and back and slams the door:",
    "Too cold to get up though at the edges of the blinds the sky",
    "Shows blue as flames that break on a red sea in which black coals float:",
    "Pebbles in a pocket embed the seam with grains of sand",
    "Which, as they will, have found their way into a pattern between foot and bedfoot",
    "\u201cA place for everything and everything in its place\u201d how wasteful, how wrong",
    "It seems when snow in fat, hand-stuffed flakes falls slow and steady in the sea",
    "\u201cNow you see it, now you don\u2019t\u201d the waves growl as they grind ashore and roll out",
    "At your feet (in boots) a Christmas tree naked of needles",
    "Still wound with swags of tarnishing tinsel, faintly alarming as the thought",
    "Of damp electricity or sluggish lightning and for your health desiring pains",
    "The wind awards: Chapped Lips: on which to rub Time\u2019s latest acquisition",
    "Tinned, dowel shaped and inappropriately flavored sheep wool fat",
    "A greasy sense-eclipsing fog \u201cI can\u2019t see",
    "Without my glasses\u201d \u201cYou certainly can\u2019t see with them all steamed up",
    "Like that. Pull over, park and wipe them off.\u201d The thunder of a summer\u2019s day",
    "Rolls down the shimmering blacktop and mowed grass juice thickens the air",
    "Like \u201cStir until it coats the spoon, remove from heat, let cool and chill\u201d",
    "Like this, graying up for more snow, maybe, in which a small flock",
    "Of\u2014sparrows?\u2014small, anyway, dust-kitty-colored birds fly up",
    "On a dotted diagonal and there, ah, is the answer:",
    "Starlings, bullies of birdland, lousing up",
    "The pecking order, respecters of no rights (what bird is) unloved (oh?)",
    "Not so likeable as some: that\u2019s temperate enough and the temperature",
    "Drops to rise to snowability of a softness even in its scent of roses",
    "Made of untinted butter frosting: Happy Name Day, Blue Jay, staggering",
    "On slow-up wings into the shrunk into itself from cold forsythia snarl",
    "And above these thoughts there waves another tangle but one parched with heat",
    "And not with cold although the heat is on because of cold settled all",
    "About as though, swimming under water, in clearly fishy water, you",
    "Inhaled and found one could and live and also found you altogether",
    "Did not like it, January, laid out on a bed of ice, disgorging",
    "February, shaped like a flounder, and March with her steel head pocketbook,",
    "And April, goofy and under-dressed and with a loud laugh, and May",
    "Who will of course be voted Miss Best Liked (she expects it),",
    "And June, with a toothpaste smile, fresh from her flea bath, and gross July,",
    "Flexing itself, and steamy August, with thighs and eyes to match, and September",
    "Diving into blue October, dour November, and deadly dull December which now",
    "And then with a surprised blank look produces from its hand the ace of trumps",
    "Or sets within the ice white hairline of a new moon the gibbous rest:",
    "Global, blue, Columbian, a blue dull definite and thin as the first day",
    "Of February when, in the steamed and freezing capital cash built",
    "Without a plan to be its own best monument its skyline set in stacks",
    "Like poker chips (signed \u201cAutodidact\u201d), at the crux of a view there crosses",
    "A flatcar-trailer piled with five of the cheaper sort of yachts, tarpaulined,",
    "Plus one youth in purple pants, a maid in her uniform and an \u201cIt\u2019s not real",
    "Anything\u201d Cossack hat and coat, a bus one-quarter full of strangers and",
    "The other familiar fixings of lengthening short days: \u201cHe\u2019s outgrown them",
    "Before you can turn around\u201d and see behind you the landscape of the past",
    "Where beached boats bask and terraced cliffs are hung with oranges",
    "Among dark star-gleaming leaves, and, descending the dizzying rough stairs",
    "Littered with goat turd beads\u2014such packaging\u2014you\u2014he\u2014she\u2014",
    "One\u2014someone\u2014stops to break off a bit of myrtle and recite all the lines",
    "Of Goethe that come back, and those in French, \u201c",
    "... ?\u201d the air",
    "Fills with chalk dust from banged erasers, behind the February dunes",
    "Ice boats speed and among the reeds there winds a little frozen stream",
    "Where kids in kapok ice-skate and play at Secret City as the sun",
    "Sets before dinner, the snow on fields turns pink and under the hatched ice",
    "The water slides darkly and over it a never before seen liquefaction of the sun",
    "In a chemical yellow greener than sulphur a flash of petroleum by-product",
    "Unbelievable, unwanted and as lovely as though someone you knew all your life",
    "Said the one inconceivable thing and then went on washing dishes: the sky",
    "Flows with impersonal passion and loosening jet trails (eyes tearing from the cold)",
    "And on the beach, between foam frozen in a thick scalloped edging so like",
    "Weird cheek-mottling pillowcase embroidery, on the water-darkened sand the waves",
    "Keep free of frost, a gull strangles on a length of nylon fishline and the dog",
    "Trots proudly off, tail held high, to bury a future dinner among cut grass on a dune:",
    "The ice boats furl their sails and all pile into cars and go off to the super market",
    "Its inviting foods and cleansers sold under tunes with sealed in memory-flavor",
    "\u201cHot House Rhubarb\u201d \u201cWhite Rock Girl\u201d \u201cCitrus Futures\u201d \u201cCheap Bitter Beans\u201d and",
    "In its parking lot vast as the kiss to which is made the most complete surrender",
    "In a setting of leaves, backs of stores, a house on a rise admired for being",
    "Somewhat older than some others (prettier, too?) a man in a white apron embraces a car",
    "Briefly in the cold with his eyes as one might hug oneself for warmth for love",
    "\u2014What a paint job, smooth as an eggplant; what a meaty chest, smooth as an eggplant",
    "\u2014Is it too much to ask your car to understand you? the converse isn\u2019t and the sky",
    "Maps out new roads so that, driving at right angles to the wind, clouds in ranks",
    "Contrive in diminishing perspective a part of a picture postcard of a painting",
    "Over oak scrub where a filling station has: gas, a locked toilet (to keep dirt in)",
    "A busted soda pop machine, no maps and \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you",
    "\u201d so",
    "The sky empties itself to a color, there, where yesterday\u2019s puddle",
    "Offers its hospitality to people-trash and nature-trash in tans and silvers",
    "And black grit like that in corners of a room in this or that cheap dump",
    "Where the ceiling light burns night and day and we stare at or into each",
    "Other\u2019s eyes in hope the other reads there what he reads: snow, wind",
    "Lifted; black water, slashed with white; and that which is, which is beyond",
    "Happiness or love or mixed with them or more than they or less, unchanging change,",
    "\u201cLook,\u201d the ocean said (it was tumbled, like our sheets), \u201clook in my eyes\u201d"

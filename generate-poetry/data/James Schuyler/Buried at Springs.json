    "There is a hornet in the room",
    "and one of us will have to go",
    "out the window into the late",
    "August midafternoon sun. I",
    "won. There is a certain challenge",
    "in being humane to hornets",
    "but not much. A launch draws",
    "two lines of wake behind it",
    "on the bay like a delta",
    "with a melted base. Sandy",
    "billows, or so they look,",
    "of feathery ripe heads of grass,",
    "an acid-yellow kind of",
    "goldenrod glowing or glowering",
    "in shade. Rocks with rags",
    "of shadow, washed dust clouts",
    "that will never bleach.",
    "It is not like this at all.",
    "The rapid running of the",
    "lapping water a hollow knock",
    "of someone shipping oars:",
    "it\u2019s eleven years since",
    "Frank sat at this desk and",
    "saw and heard it all",
    "the incessant water the",
    "immutable crickets only",
    "not the same: new needles",
    "on the spruce, new seaweed",
    "on the low-tide rocks",
    "other grass and other water",
    "even the great gold lichen",
    "on a granite boulder",
    "even the boulder quite",
    "literally is not the same",
    "A day subtle and suppressed",
    "in mounds of juniper enfolding",
    "scratchy pockets of shadow",
    "while bigness\u2014rocks, trees, a stump\u2014",
    "stands shadowless in an overcast",
    "of ripe grass. There is nothing",
    "but shade, like the boggy depths",
    "of a stand of spruce, its resonance",
    "just the thin scream",
    "of mosquitoes ascending.",
    "Boats are light lumps on the bay",
    "stretching past erased islands",
    "to ocean and the terrible tumble",
    "and London (\u201crain persisting\u201d)",
    "and Paris (\u201cchanging to rain\u201d).",
    "Delicate day, setting the bright",
    "of a young spruce against the cold",
    "of an old one hung with unripe cones",
    "each exuding at its tip",
    "gum, pungent, clear as a tear,",
    "a day tarnished and fractured",
    "as the quartz in the rocks",
    "of a dulled and distant point,",
    "a day like a gull passing",
    "with a slow flapping of wings",
    "in a kind of lope, without",
    "breeze enough to shake loose",
    "the last of the fireweed flowers,",
    "a faintly clammy day, like wet silk",
    "stained by one dead branch",
    "the harsh russet of dried blood."

    "For months my daughter carried",
    "a dead monarch in a quart mason jar.",
    "To and from school in her backpack,",
    "to her only friend\u2019s house. At the dinner table",
    "it sat like a guest alongside the pot roast.",
    "She took it to bed, propped by her pillow.",
    "Was it the year her brother was born?",
    "Was this her own too-fragile baby",
    "that had lived\u2014so briefly\u2014in its glassed world?",
    "Or the year she refused to go to her father\u2019s house?",
    "Was this the holding-her-breath girl she became there?",
    "This plump child in her rolled-down socks",
    "I sometimes wanted to haul back inside me",
    "and carry safe again. What was her fierce",
    "commitment? I never understood.",
    "We just lived with the dead winged thing",
    "as part of her, as part of us,",
    "weightless in its heavy jar."

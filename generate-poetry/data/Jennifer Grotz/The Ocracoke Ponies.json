    "No one saw the first ones",
    "swim ashore centuries ago,",
    "nudged by waves into the marsh grasses.",
    "When you look into their faces, there is no trace",
    "of the ship seized with terror, the crashing waves",
    "and the horses\u2019 cries when thrown overboard.",
    "Every afternoon you ride your bicycle to the pasture",
    "to watch the twitch of their manes and ivory tails",
    "unroll a carpet of silence, to see ponies lost in dream.",
    "But it isn\u2019t dream, that place",
    "your mind drifts to, that museum of memory",
    "inventoried in opposition to the present.",
    "You felt it once on a plane,",
    "taking off from a city you didn\u2019t want to leave,",
    "the stranded moment when the plane lifts into the clouds.",
    "That\u2019s not dream, it\u2019s not even sleeping.",
    "It is the nature of sleeping to be unaware.",
    "This was some kind of waiting for the world to come back."

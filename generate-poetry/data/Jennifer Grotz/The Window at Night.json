  "text": [
    "Eyes wide like an owl\u2019s, an aspirin-pale face",
    "foretells in lamplight how it accumulates age.",
    "Somewhat masked, somewhat naked, there\u2019s no way",
    "to know what others see when looking at it.",
    "All five of the body\u2019s senses crowd",
    "on this small planet a weather of hair surrounds.",
    "My face is not a democracy\u2014the eyes are tyrants",
    "and the ears are radical dissenters.",
    "In the conversations of eyebrows, mine are whispers.",
    "Like the window at night, the face reflects too,",
    "uncertain how to change when greeting itself",
    "(and is it not cruel when another\u2019s face",
    "won\u2019t reflect acknowledgment of you?).",
    "My mother, my father, and my brother are found",
    "in the blurring of feature and expression.",
    "Cynicism finds no purchase here;",
    "the same cannot be said for sadness",
    "(and look deeper\u2014anger hides in the jaw).",
    "And while the nose quietly broods",
    "like an actor rehearsing his soliloquy,",
    "the empty page of the forehead, when I raise my brows,",
    "fills suddenly with questions."

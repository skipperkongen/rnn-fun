    "Like buying a ticket inland",
    "to barely understandable provinces",
    "with no language at all I bargain and pay",
    "for this warm planet",
    "tipping the scales of wrist and elbow",
    "spreading my fingers with its weight to read",
    "my life-line my heart-line",
    "my seams and mounds of fortune.",
    "I stare",
    "into the sun on smoggy evenings",
    "the throat of an old street oven",
    "that seems to expand as I anticipate",
    "its glow engulfing my solar system.",
    "I open my mouth",
    "and China fills it sliding into tartness",
    "forcing my lips",
    "to begin its name",
    "over and over then finger-painting my chin",
    "with the gel of ripeness.",
    "I swallow the pabulum of infancy",
    "the sweet mucilage of age.",
    "It makes me eat like a person alone",
    "who hasn\u2019t loved for years.",
    "There seems to be no core",
    "the few black seeds hardly noticed",
    "in its one undifferentiated cell",
    "other tongue",
    "that makes mine lazy the flavour . . .",
    "the flavour is . . .",
    "my hand moves like an incantation",
    "through an alley of blunt flames",
    "that can be eaten with a spoon.",
    "I gorge",
    "on a people\u2019s staple",
    "fat Buddha squat Amida",
    "repeat three times",
    "persimmon persimmon persimmon",
    "and go to heaven."

    "Go where those others went to the dark boundary",
    "for the golden fleece of nothingness your last prize",
    "go upright among those who are on their knees",
    "among those with their backs turned and those toppled in the dust",
    "you were saved not in order to live",
    "you have little time you must give testimony",
    "be courageous when the mind deceives you be courageous",
    "in the final account only this is important",
    "and let your helpless Anger be like the sea",
    "whenever you hear the voice of the insulted and beaten",
    "let your sister Scorn not leave you",
    "for the informers executioners cowards\u2014they will win",
    "they will go to your funeral and with relief will throw a lump of earth",
    "the woodborer will write your smoothed-over biography",
    "and do not forgive truly it is not in your power",
    "to forgive in the name of those betrayed at dawn",
    "beware however of unnecessary pride",
    "keep looking at your clown\u2019s face in the mirror",
    "repeat: I was called\u2014weren\u2019t there better ones than I",
    "beware of dryness of heart love the morning spring",
    "the bird with an unknown name the winter oak",
    "light on a wall the splendour of the sky",
    "they don\u2019t need your warm breath",
    "they are there to say: no one will console you",
    "be vigilant\u2014when the light on the mountains gives the sign\u2014arise and go",
    "as long as blood turns in the breast your dark star",
    "repeat old incantations of humanity fables and legends",
    "because this is how you will attain the good you will not attain",
    "repeat great words repeat them stubbornly",
    "like those crossing the desert who perished in the sand",
    "and they will reward you with what they have at hand",
    "with the whip of laughter with murder on a garbage heap",
    "go because only in this way will you be admitted to the company of cold skulls",
    "to the company of your ancestors: Gilgamesh Hector Roland",
    "the defenders of the kingdom without limit and the city of ashes",
    "Be faithful Go"

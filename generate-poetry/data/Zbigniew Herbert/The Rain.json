    "When my older brother",
    "came back from war",
    "he had on his forehead a little silver star",
    "and under the star",
    "an abyss",
    "a splinter of shrapnel",
    "hit him at Verdun",
    "or perhaps at Gr\u00fcnwald",
    "(he\u2019d forgotten the details)",
    "he used to talk much",
    "in many languages",
    "but he liked most of all",

    "until losing breath",
    "he commanded his dead pals to run",
    "Roland Kowaski Hannibal",
    "he shouted",
    "that this was the last crusade",
    "that Carthage soon would fall",
    "and then sobbing confessed",
    "that Napoleon did not like him",
    "we looked at him",
    "getting paler and paler",
    "abandoned by his senses",
    "he turned slowly into a monument",
    "into musical shells of ears",
    "entered a stone forest",
    "and the skin of his face",
    "was secured",
    "with the blind dry",
    "buttons of eyes",
    "nothing was left him",
    "but touch",
    "what stories",
    "he told with his hands",
    "in the right he had romances",
    "in the left soldier\u2019s memories",
    "they took my brother",
    "and carried him out of town",
    "he returns every fall",
    "slim and very quiet",
    "he does not want to come in",
    "he knocks at the window for me",
    "we walk together in the streets",
    "and he recites to me",
    "improbable tales",
    "touching my face",
    "with blind fingers of rain"

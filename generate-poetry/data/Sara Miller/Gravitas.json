    "The overweight, overnight parts",

    "Their clothes no longer fit,",
    "it was this that brought them",
    "to me crying, their faces twitching.",
    "That had to end. No, they said,",
    "it didn\u2019t. So I rolled over to ghosts",
    "that couldn\u2019t dent a pillow.",
    "The clock shed. Night pulled its",
    "burdens into harbor and I woke,",
    "glad for the day, its telltale light,",
    "its flying minute, that genie work,",
    "and the everlasting perturbations",
    "of my people, their glories,",
    "their heavy last words,",
    "and for these, I rose."

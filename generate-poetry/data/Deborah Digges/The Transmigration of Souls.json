    "Inside the starboard window",
    "of his room in a boat at sea,",
    "the piece of earth he's scraped from a dead gull\u2019s leg",
    "sprouts eighty different species, green",
    "under bell glass. By the sunlight",
    "of the oil lamp he makes rain",
    "as the wind picks up toward Chiloe,",
    "Port Famine, Concepcion, and then Galapagos.",
    "Here he finds shipwrecked sailors\u2019 epitaphs cut",
    "into the shell of an old tortoise",
    "who\u2019s tame enough to ride,",
    "too huge to slaughter.",
    "Here the birds are fearless.",
    "He can catch them with his hands, let them",
    "perch on his finger before he",
    "breaks their necks and wraps them",
    "in his shirt and sets their eggs on branches drifting",
    "from the shoreline, island to island.",
    "Now everywhere he meets himself.",
    "He\u2019s tired, and half the world from home.",
    "But his mind has entered the morning",
    "the way all the animals",
    "kept in his cabin in jars along the wall grow",
    "smaller in sequence",
    "until the window opens on the sea,",
    "so that what he\u2019ll remember",
    "are the wasted spaces, the desert rock spread out for miles",
    "as if the earth were flat again,",
    "dangerous at the horizon,",
    "where the stones, piled, shine",
    "against lava black.",
    "Dew pools in the evenings.",
    "A few pale leaves appear."

    "There is a strong wall about me to protect me:",
    "It is built of the words you have said to me.",
    "There are swords about me to keep me safe:",
    "They are the kisses of your lips.",
    "Before me goes a shield to guard me from harm:",

    "All the wishes of my mind know your name,",
    "And the white desires of my heart",
    "They are acquainted with you.",

    "That is a cry to you.",
    "My blood beats out your name to me,",
    "unceasing, pitiless",
    "Your name, your name."

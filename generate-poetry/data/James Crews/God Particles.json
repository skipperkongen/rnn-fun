    "I could almost hear their soft collisions",
    "on the cold air today, but when I came in,",
    "shed my layers and stood alone by the fire,",
    "I felt them float toward me like spores",
    "flung far from their source, having crossed",
    "miles of oceans and fields unknown to most",
    "just to keep my body fixed to its place",
    "on the earth. Call them",
    "if you must,",
    "these messengers that bring hard evidence",
    "of what I once was and where I have been\u2014",
    "filling me with bits of stardust, whaleskin,",
    "goosedown from the pillow where Einstein",
    "once slept, tucked in his cottage in New Jersey,",
    "dreaming of things I know I\u2019ll never see."

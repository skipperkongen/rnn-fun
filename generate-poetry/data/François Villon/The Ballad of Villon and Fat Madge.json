    "\u2018\u2019Tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation.\u2019 -Falstaff",
    "\u2018The night cometh, when no man can work.\u2019",
    "What though the beauty I love and serve be cheap,",
    "Ought you to take me for a beast or fool?",
    "All things a man could wish are in her keep;",
    "For her I turn swashbuckler in love\u2019s school.",
    "When folk drop in, I take my pot and stool",
    "And fall to drinking with no more ado.",
    "I fetch them bread, fruit, cheese, and water, too;",
    "I say all\u2019s right so long as I\u2019m well paid;",
    "\u2018Look in again when your flesh troubles you,",
    "Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.\u2019",
    "But soon the devil\u2019s among us flesh and fell,",
    "When penniless to bed comes Madge my whore;",
    "I loathe the very sight of her like hell.",
    "I snatch gown, girdle, surcoat, all she wore,",
    "And tell her, these shall stand against her score.",
    "She grips her hips with both hands, cursing God,",
    "Swearing by Jesus\u2019 body, bones, and blood,",
    "That they shall not. Then I, no whit dismayed,",
    "Cross her cracked nose with some stray shiver of wood",
    "Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.",
    "When all\u2019s made up she drops me a windy word,",
    "Bloat like a beetle puffed and poisonous:",
    "Grins, thumps my pate, and calls me dickey-bird,",
    "And cuffs me with a fist that\u2019s ponderous.",
    "We sleep like logs, being drunken both of us;",
    "Then when we wake her womb begins to stir;",
    "To save her seed she gets me under her",
    "Wheezing and whining, flat as planks are laid:",
    "And thus she spoils me for a whoremonger",
    "Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.",
    "Blow, hail or freeze, I\u2019ve bread here baked rent free!",
    "Whoring\u2019s my trade, and my whore pleases me;",
    "Bad cat, bad rat; we\u2019re just the same if weighed.",
    "We that love filth, filth follows us, you see;",
    "Honour flies from us, as from her we flee",
    "Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.",
    "I bequeath likewise to fat Madge",
    "This little song to learn and study;",
    "By god\u2019s head she\u2019s a sweet fat fadge,",
    "Devout and soft of flesh and ruddy;",
    "I love her with my soul and body,",
    "So doth she me, sweet dainty thing.",
    "If you fall in with such a lady,",
    "Read it, and give it her to sing."

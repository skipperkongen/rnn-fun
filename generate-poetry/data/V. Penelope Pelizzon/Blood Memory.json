    "too late to dull the muscle cramping",
    "monthly for his slake of iron,",
    "I am just a body bleeding in bad light.",
    "But after an hour, as the wrenching wanes,",
    "I run more water in, remembering",
    "and, while I cried,",
    "In a palm of pinkish water, I scoop up",
    "red to nearly black as I tilt my hand",
    "against the light to see it",
    "glistening like a ruby cabochon,",
    "appealing as it appalls,",
    "recalling one future, years ago,",
    "that would have borne itself on my blood",
    "The question swims into view:",
    "would I harbor another life now?",
    "Last spring, I sat above the harbor in Naples",
    "safely back at school. Palpable,",

    "Still, it wasn\u2019t long before our talk\u2019s",
    "soccer games in the Flegrean fields,",
    "reborn and swaddled putto-pink",
    "in mist above the fumaroles;",
    "first words, whose honeyed gravity",
    "Their new principal refused to pay",
    "rabbits and a little clutch of chicks",
    "someone had written across the door in blood.",
    "that was how these things were done.",
    "the harbor glinted below Serena\u2019s voice.",
    "with",
    "She was scoured of identity.",
    "where it liquefies on schedule",
    "still protected by the saint.",
    "if some net had hauled these images",
    "lapels flickered yellow wicks of mimosa,",
    "burned on the flank of Mt. Vesuvius",
    "the city managed to transubstantiate",
    "Fireworks seethed above the bobbing masts.",
    "From an alley\u2019s mouth",
    "a gobbet of men disgorged.",
    "One, drunker than the others, loomed",
    "Whatever he meant, he meant to make us bleed.",
    "of holding others\u2019 words as worry stones",
    "the hematite heaviness of a final",
    "in a college project on oral history.",
    "through the wrack of half-forgotten truths.",
    "Her years in the Women\u2019s Army Corps,",
    "Decades as a secretary. Marriage.",
    "five months along, it was too late,",
    "The tape\u2019s hiss like receding surf.",
    "hauled at by tides, sleeking invasive grit",
    "hiding in the tub for half an hour",
    "Little plumes of my flesh rock in the swells,",
    "and with my toes I pull the plug.",
    "Drained, I need a couple hours of sleep,",
    "into a bay of blood-threshed water.",
    "bites my lungs and I can\u2019t breathe.",
    "Then, with a clarity I mistake",
    "below trees, at a table laid",
    "from a shudder in the grove\u2019s air,",
    "I\u2019ve never known in any other place,",
    "braised and stuffed, as Apicius writes,"

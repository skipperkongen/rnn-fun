    "I could not tell I had jumped off that bus,",
    "that bus in motion, with my child in my arms,",
    "because I did not know it. I believed my own story:",
    "I had fallen, or the bus had started up",
    "when I had one foot in the air.",
    "I would not remember the tightening of my jaw,",
    "the irk that I\u2019d missed my stop, the step out",
    "into the air, the clear child",
    "gazing about her in the air as I plunged",
    "to one knee on the street, scraped it, twisted it,",
    "the bus skidding to a stop, the driver",
    "jumping out, my daughter laughing",
    "I have never done it",
    "again, I have been very careful.",
    "I have kept an eye on that nice young mother",
    "who lightly leapt",
    "off the moving vehicle",
    "onto the stopped street, her life",
    "in her hands, her life\u2019s life in her hands."

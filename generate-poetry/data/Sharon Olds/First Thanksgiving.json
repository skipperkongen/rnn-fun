    "When she comes back, from college, I will see",
    "the skin of her upper arms, cool,",
    "matte, glossy. She will hug me, my old",
    "soupy chest against her breasts,",
    "I will smell her hair! She will sleep in this apartment,",
    "her sleep like an untamed, good object,",
    "like a soul in a body. She came into my life the",
    "second great arrival, after him, fresh",
    "from the other world\u2014which lay, from within him,",
    "within me. Those nights, I fed her to sleep,",
    "week after week, the moon rising,",
    "and setting, and waxing\u2014whirling, over the months,",
    "in a slow blur, around our planet.",
    "Now she doesn\u2019t need love like that, she has",
    "had it. She will walk in glowing, we will talk,",
    "and then, when she\u2019s fast asleep, I\u2019ll exult",
    "to have her in that room again,",
    "behind that door! As a child, I caught",
    "bees, by the wings, and held them, some seconds,",
    "looked into their wild faces,",
    "listened to them sing, then tossed them back",
    "into the air\u2014I remember the moment the",
    "arc of my toss swerved, and they entered",
    "the corrected curve of their departure."

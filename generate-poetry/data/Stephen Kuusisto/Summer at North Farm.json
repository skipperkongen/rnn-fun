    "Fires, always fires after midnight,",
    "the sun depending in the purple birches",
    "and gleaming like a copper kettle.",
    "By the solstice they\u2019d burned everything,",
    "the bad-luck sleigh, a twisted rocker,",
    "things \u201cpossessed\u201d and not-quite-right.",
    "The bonfire coils and lurches,",
    "big as a house, and then it settles.",
    "The dancers come, dressed like rainbows",
    "(if rainbows could be spun),",
    "and linking hands they turn",
    "to the melancholy fiddles.",
    "A red bird spreads its wings now",
    "and in the darker days to come."

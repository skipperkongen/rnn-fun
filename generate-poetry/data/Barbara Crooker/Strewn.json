    "It\u2019d been a long winter, rags of snow hanging on; then, at the end",
    "of April, an icy nor\u2019easter, powerful as a hurricane. But now",
    "I\u2019ve landed on the coast of Maine, visiting a friend who lives",
    "two blocks from the ocean, and I can\u2019t believe my luck,",
    "out this mild morning, race-walking along the strand.",
    "Every dog within fifty miles is off-leash, running",
    "for the sheer dopey joy of it. No one\u2019s in the water,",
    "but walkers and shellers leave their tracks on the hardpack.",
    "The flat sand shines as if varnished in a painting. Underfoot,",
    "strewn, are broken bits and pieces, deep indigo mussels, whorls",
    "of whelk, chips of purple and white wampum, hinges of quahog,",
    "fragments of sand dollars. Nothing whole, everything",
    "broken, washed up here, stranded. The light pours down, a rinse",
    "of lemon on a cold plate. All of us, broken, some way",
    "or other. All of us dazzling in the brilliant slanting light."

    "Last night a man on the radio,",
    "a still young man, said the business district",
    "of his hometown had been plowed under.",
    "The town was in North Dakota.",
    "Grass, where the red-and-gold",
    "Woolworth sign used to be,",
    "where the revolving doors",
    "took him inside Sears;",
    "gone the sweaty seats",
    "of the Roxy\u2014or was it the Princess\u2014",
    "of countless Friday nights",
    "that whipped his heart to a gallop",
    "when a girl touched him, as the gun",
    "on the screen flashed in the moonlight.",
    "Grass, that egalitarian green,",
    "pulling its sheet over rubble,",
    "over his barely cold childhood,",
    "on which he walks as others walk",
    "over a buried Mayan temple",
    "or a Roman aqueduct beneath",
    "a remote sheep pasture",
    "in the British Isles. Yet his voice,",
    "the modest voice on the radio,",
    "was almost apologetic,",
    "as if to say, what\u2019s one small town,",
    "even if it is one\u2019s own,",
    "in an age of mass destruction,",
    "and never mind the streets and stones",
    "of a grown man\u2019\ufeffs childhood\u2014",
    "as if to say, the lives we live",
    "before the present moment",
    "are graves we walk away from.",
    "Except we don\u2019t. We\u2019re all",
    "pillars of salt. My life began",
    "with Beethoven and Schubert",
    "on my mother\u2019s grand piano,",
    "the shiny Bechstein on which she played",
    "the famous symphonies",
    "in piano reductions. But they were no",
    "reductions for me, the child",
    "who now remembers nothing",
    "earlier than that music,",
    "a weather I was born into,",
    "a jubilant light or dusky sadness",
    "struck up by my mother\u2019s hands.",
    "Where does music come from",
    "and where does it go when it\u2019s over\u2014",
    "the child\u2019s unanswered question",
    "about more than music.",
    "My mother is dead, and the piano",
    "she could not take with her into exile",
    "burned with our city in World War II.",
    "That is the half-truth. The other half",
    "is that it\u2019s still her black Bechstein",
    "each concert pianist plays for me",
    "and that her self-taught fingers",
    "are behind each virtuoso performance",
    "on the stereo, giving me back",
    "my prewar childhood city",
    "intact and real. I don\u2019t know",
    "if the man from North Dakota has",
    "some music that brings back",
    "his town to him, but something does,",
    "and whatever he remembers",
    "is durable and instantly",
    "retrievable and lit",
    "by a sky or streetlight",
    "which does not change. That must be why",
    "he sounded casual about",
    "the mindless wreckage, clumsy",
    "as an empty threat."

    "Somewhere now she takes off the dress I am",
    "putting on. It is evening in the antiworld",
    "where she lives. She is forty-five years away",
    "from her death, the hole which spit her out",
    "into pain, impossible at first, later easing,",
    "going, gone. She has unlearned much by now.",
    "Her skin is firming, her memory sharpens,",
    "her hair has grown glossy. She sees without glasses,",
    "she falls in love easily. Her husband has lost his",
    "shuffle, they laugh together. Their money shrinks,",
    "but their ardor increases. Soon her second child",
    "will be young enough to fight its way into her",
    "body and change its life to monkey to frog to",

    "and the freedom of children. She wants to read",
    "and ride on a roller coaster",
    "without getting sick. I think of her as she will",
    "be at fifteen, awkward, too serious. In the",
    "mirror I see she uses her left hand to write,",
    "her other to open a jar. By now our lives should",
    "have crossed. Somewhere sometime we must have",
    "passed one another like going and coming trains,",
    "with both of us looking the other way."

    "People whose lives have been shaped",
    "by history\u2014and it is always tragic\u2014",
    "do not want to talk about it,",
    "would rather dance, give parties",
    "on thrift-shop china. You feel",
    "wonderful in their homes,",
    "two leaky rooms, nests",
    "they stowed inside their hearts",
    "on the road into exile.",
    "They know how to fix potato peelings",
    "and apple cores so you smack your lips.",
    "The words",
    "hold no terror for them.",
    "Obediently they rise",
    "and go with only a rucksack",
    "or tote bag. If they weep,",
    "it\u2019s when you\u2019re not looking.",
    "To tame their nightmares, they choose",
    "the most dazzling occupations,",
    "swallow the flames in the sunset sky,",
    "jump through burning hoops",
    "in their elegant tiger suits.",
    "Cover your eyes: there\u2019s one",
    "walking on a thread",
    "thirty feet above us\u2014",
    "shivering points of light",
    "leap across her body,",
    "and she works without a net."

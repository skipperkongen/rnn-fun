    "I set forth one misted white day of June",
    "Beneath the great Atlantic rainway, and heard:",
    "\u201cHonestly you smite worlds of truth, but",
    "Lose your own trains of thought, like a pigeon.",
    "Did you once ride in Kenneth\u2019s machine?\u201d",
    "\u201cYes, I rode there, an old man in shorts, blind,",
    "Who had lost his way in the filling station; Kenneth was kind.\u201d",
    "\u201cDid he fill your motionless ears with resonance and stain?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo, he spoke not as a critic, but as a man.\u201d",
    "\u201cTell me, what did he say?\u201d \u201cHe said,",
    "\u2018My eyes are the white sky, the gravel on the groundway my sad lament.\u2019\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd yet he drives between the two. . . .\u201d \u201cExactly, Jane,",
    "And that is the modern idea of fittingness,",
    "To, always in motion, lose nothing, although beneath the",
    "Rainway they move in threes and twos completely",
    "Ruined for themselves, like moving pictures.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut how other?\u201d \u201cFormulalessness, to go from the sun",
    "Into love\u2019s sweet disrepair. He would fondly express",
    "\u2018Rain trees\u2019\u2014which is not a poem, \u2018rain trees. . . .\u2019\u201d",
    "\u201cStill, it is mysterious to have an engine",
    "That floats bouquets! and one day in the rear-vision",
    "Mirror of his car we vowed delight,",
    "The insufficiency of the silverware in the sunlight,",
    "The dreams he steals from and smiles, losing gain.\u201d",
    "\u201cYet always beneath the rainway unsyntactical",
    "Beauty might leap up!\u201d \u201cThat we might sing",
    "From smiles\u2019 ravines, \u2018Rose, the reverse of everything,",
    "May be profaned or talked at like a hat.\u2019\u201d",
    "\u201cOh that was sweet and short, like the minuet",
    "Of stars, which would permit us to seem our best friends",
    "By silver\u2019s eminent lights! For nature is so small, ends",
    "Falsely reign, distending the time we did",
    "Behind our hope for body-work, riding with Kenneth.\u201d",
    "Their voicing ceased, then started again, to complain",
    "That we are offered nothing when it starts to rain",
    "In the same way, though we are dying for the truth."

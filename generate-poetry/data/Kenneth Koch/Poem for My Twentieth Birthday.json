    "The palm trees stalking like deliberate giants",
    "for my birthday, and all the hot adolescent memories",
    "seen through a screen of water . . .",
    "For my birthday thrust into the adult and actual:",
    "expected to perform the action, not to ponder",
    "the reality beyond the fact,",
    "the man standing upright in the dream."

    "Dear god of armed robberies and puff-puff-pass,",
    "a chalk outline unpeels from the street, smashes",
    "every windshield, and leaves florid temples of crack",
    "on porches. Burnt-black pleats of joint-pressed lips",
    "prophesied your return. Please accept these nickel bags",
    "as offerings. Brick bastions of piss-stench thresholds",
    "and boarded windows require a weekly sacrifice.",
    "Is there a Tarot card called \u201cThe Corner,\u201d a shrike",
    "shown lifting a corpse from the pike of a middle finger?",
    "Children speak to their murdered brothers with a cereal box",
    "and construction paper cut into a Ouija\u2019s tongue that licks",
    "when asked if liquor could polish a skull in a way",
    "pleasing to the dead, licks",
    "when asked for a name."

    "O the days gone by! O the days gone by!",
    "The apples in the orchard, and the pathway through the rye;",
    "The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle of the quail",
    "As he piped across the meadows sweet as any nightingale;",
    "When the bloom was on the clover, and the blue was in the sky,",
    "And my happy heart brimmed over in the days gone by.",
    "In the days gone by, when my naked feet were tripped",
    "By the honey-suckle\u2019s tangles where the water-lilies dipped,",
    "And the ripples of the river lipped the moss along the brink",
    "Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed cattle came to drink,",
    "And the tilting snipe stood fearless of the truant\u2019s wayward cry",
    "And the splashing of the swimmer, in the days gone by.",
    "O the days gone by! O the days gone by!",
    "The music of the laughing lip, the luster of the eye;",
    "The childish faith in fairies, and Aladdin\u2019s magic ring\u2014",
    "The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in everything,\u2014",
    "When life was like a story, holding neither sob nor sigh,",
    "In the golden olden glory of the days gone by."

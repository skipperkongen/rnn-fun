    "When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder\u2019s in the shock,",
    "And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin\u2019 turkey-cock,",
    "And the clackin\u2019 of the guineys, and the cluckin\u2019 of the hens,",
    "And the rooster\u2019s hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;",
    "O, it\u2019s then\u2019s the times a feller is a-feelin\u2019 at his best,",
    "With the risin\u2019 sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest,",
    "As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock,",
    "When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder\u2019s in the shock.",
    "They\u2019s something kindo\u2019 harty-like about the atmusfere",
    "When the heat of summer\u2019s over and the coolin\u2019 fall is here\u2014",
    "Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossums on the trees,",
    "And the mumble of the hummin\u2019-birds and buzzin\u2019 of the bees;",
    "But the air\u2019s so appetizin\u2019; and the landscape through the haze",
    "Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days",
    "Is a pictur\u2019 that no painter has the colorin\u2019 to mock\u2014",
    "When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder\u2019s in the shock.",
    "The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,",
    "And the raspin\u2019 of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn;",
    "The stubble in the furries\u2014kindo\u2019 lonesome-like, but still",
    "A-preachin\u2019 sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill;",
    "The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;",
    "The hosses in theyr stalls below\u2014the clover over-head!\u2014",
    "O, it sets my hart a-clickin\u2019 like the tickin\u2019 of a clock,",
    "When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder\u2019s in the shock!",
    "Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps",
    "Is poured around the celler-floor in red and yeller heaps;",
    "And your cider-makin\u2019 \u2019s over, and your wimmern-folks is through",
    "With their mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and saussage, too! ...",
    "I don\u2019t know how to tell it\u2014but ef sich a thing could be",
    "As the Angels wantin\u2019 boardin\u2019, and they\u2019d call around on",
    "\u2014",
    "I\u2019d want to \u2019commodate \u2019em\u2014all the whole-indurin\u2019 flock\u2014",
    "When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder\u2019s in the shock!"

    "Class is over, the teacher",
    "and the pianist gone,",
    "but one dancer",
    "in a pale blue",
    "leotard stays",
    "to practice alone without music,",
    "turning grand jetes",
    "through the haze of late afternoon.",
    "Her eyes are focused",
    "on the balancing point",
    "no one else sees",
    "as she spins in this quiet",
    "made of mirrors and light\u2014",
    "a blue rose on a nail\u2014",
    "then stops and lifts",
    "her arms in an oval pause",
    "and leans out",
    "a little more, a little more,",
    "there, in slow motion",
    "upon the air."

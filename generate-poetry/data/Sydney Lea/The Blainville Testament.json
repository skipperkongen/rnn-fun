    "I remember how that canny man Montaigne",
    "wrote that all philosophy consists",
    "in learning how to die. Not that to tell",
    "this tale will be my death. But I want it right.",
    "Nor that philosophy is what I\u2019m after;",
    "words, rather\u2014the way that strung together",
    "they help things last. Or may. I put them here",
    "because of late the spoken ones come hard,",
    "for want of conversation and of breath.",
    "It\u2019s how they can both take and give back shape",
    "I love. For much that we call love attaches",
    "to eloquence in things, if you can catch it:",
    "Creases in a favorite pair of shoes.",
    "A certain slant of light, as the White Nun said,",
    "on winter afternoons. Or odors, timbres,",
    "sounds. Whatever craves and begs translation.",
    "Think of a favorite cup whose dents and scratches,",
    "if you could merely find their proper order,",
    "make runic narrative of all your mornings.",
    "Your chimney\u2019s sibilants, whiffs of a bush.",
    "Feel of your hand along a porch\u2019s rail.",
    "I have a special stake in this, you see.",
    "You\u2019ll see, that is, if I can rightly show",
    "the things that I\u2019ve attended all these years,",
    "and more important, what they\u2019ve said to me",
    "in spite of all my neighbors\u2019 bleak assurance",
    "that I would never comprehend this country.",
    "\u201cA lawyer!\u201d so they huffed. \u201cAnd from the city!\u201d",
    "I\u2019m sick to death with all of that, as well",
    "as with The Crab. And yet, although he prods,",
    "he is a friend. Or maybe he\u2019s a she,",
    "as the late insurance man (a lawyer, too)",
    "lately put it: \u201cDeath is the mother of beauty,",
    "within whose burning bosom we devise",
    "our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.\u201d",
    "Oh, I have memorized the fine devices!",
    "Lord knows my poor old-womanish bosom burns",
    "and I\u2019m sleepless here, mothering The Crab,",
    "The Crab my mother. We get on together,",
    "especially with the moon out there so brilliant.",
    "We see across the meadows to The Bald Man,",
    "and summon other forms as well\u2014the spruces",
    "I once knew, the barred owls crouching in them.",
    "Hardwoods too, their shadows on the snow,",
    "there! and there! and there and there and there!",
    "In mind, I travel through them, breathing cool,",
    "as I did one winter to visit Billy Fields,",
    "six months after Blainville cut him dead,",
    "except as a kind of allegoric figure,",
    "referred to for the sake of local color.",
    "If you\u2019re from here, you\u2019ll know just what I mean,",
    "and what it\u2019s meant to me, his confidant.",
    "But if you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll want me to explain.",
    "And I\u2019ll oblige, since I am in no hurry,",
    "and since I\u2019m not yet sure whom I write",
    "It may be I address myself alone.",
    "Should you take interest, though, then you must hear",
    "\u2014as I, arrived post facto, heard\u2014of Mark.",
    "Town legend calls him Billy\u2019s Victim still,",
    "a designation I\u2019ll leave you to judge.",
    "This boy was smart, which word here signifies",
    "something like handy, or quick to learn, or both.",
    "He was among our first to drive a car,",
    "the first to plumb or rig a house with light.",
    "Others could hit a ball from plate to pond",
    "as he could do, but only Mark would have",
    "some slick machine down-cellar to make his bat!",
    "He didn\u2019t drink. He didn\u2019t chew or curse,",
    "and loved\u2014a thing for local praise\u2014to work.",
    "Shiftless Brian Hart would ask him up",
    "to his hunting camp on The Bald Man and pray for sleet,",
    "so Mark, all cabin-feverish, would tend",
    "whatever needed fixing on Hart\u2019s shack.",
    "\u201cLast fall was good,\u201d joked Brian once. \u201cIt hailed.",
    "The roof leaked through until he patched it up",
    "with half a shingle and seven common nails!\u201d",
    "Mark grinned and kicked his boot toe in the dust.",
    "Hart\u2019s trick had been no trick. Mark wasn\u2019t fooled,",
    "just, as always, happy to oblige.",
    "A paragon, in brief, in every sense\u2014",
    "moving picture handsome, a hero\u2019s posture,",
    "teeth that might be wrought from dearest marble,",
    "an automatic decency. He was",
    "model and darling both. He had a way",
    "of knowing what to do to help a neighbor",
    "before the neighbor knew. Especially elders.",
    "Elsie Cammon\u2019s cow once choked to death",
    "on a backwoods apple. (Her fence was never much,",
    "became a local figure: a man might say",
    "\u201ctight as Elsie\u2019s fence\u201d if he meant loose.",
    "Though all was change then, still the region spoke",
    "a language brightly eloquent of place,",
    "of men and women working in the place,",
    "though it was often mean, like \u201ckind as Fields,\u201d",
    "or \u201cElsie\u2019s face is rough as a bag of hammers,\u201d",
    "or\u2014as I\u2019ve heard\u2014\u201cwindy as city lawyers . . .\u201d)",
    "Billy went that day with Mark to see",
    "the cow put underground. No one knows why.",
    "I whose lawyer\u2019s job it was to sort",
    "Mark\u2019s tiny leavings\u2014I can say at least",
    "the darkest rumor is a fantasy:",
    "\u201cMurder for money?\u201d There wasn\u2019t any money!",
    "Whatever for, old Fields went out with Mark.",
    "Mark had used a kind of homemade tractor",
    "to drag the cow back farther in the woods.",
    "He\u2019d ploughed a hole, and meant to roll her in.",
    "How Billy cursed and grumbled at such waste",
    "in telling me! But be that as it may,",
    "Mark was set to heave the poor beast in",
    "when he dropped his brand-new watch in the brand-new grave.",
    "(He\u2019d had it in his shirt, according to Billy,",
    "which struck the town as odd, to say it mildly.)",
    "Mark jumped down to fetch it, the ground gave way,",
    "and half a ton of beef fell in upon him.",
    "A radical story some here still expound",
    "was that Billy shoved the cow. \u201cAt 79?\u201d",
    "So I would ask. \u201cHe moved eight hundred pounds?\u201d",
    "\u201cNever mind. He shoved her with the tractor.\u201d",
    "(That he\u2019d never seen a motor didn\u2019t matter.)",
    "The commoner accusation, less extreme,",
    "was that Billy sat and watched Mark bleed to death",
    "from wounds the rib-bones made along his side.",
    "The service that at last can fall to me",
    "is letting Billy tell us his own version.",
    "No one, while he lived, would ever ask it",
    "face to face of him. And",
    "suppressed it",
    "all these years. \u201cA lawyer\u2019s sworn to silence,\u201d",
    "so I\u2019d claim (my little irony).",
    "For noting I could say would make a difference.",
    "The town already felt it was suspicious",
    "that I was Billy\u2019s counsel at the hearing",
    "and also settled Mark\u2019s so-called estate.",
    "Of course who else would do such chores back then?",
    "But there was talk. And let them go on talking",
    "when\u2014like all my characters\u2014I\u2019m gone.",
    "I cannot care. For better or for worse,",
    "they\u2019ll know me now, and so will you, whoever",
    "you may be. This last account\u2019s for me.",
    "It is! I write to hear the voice of Billy,",
    "to watch the landscape quicken as I listen.",
    "\u201cMake no mistake, Judge . . .\u201d (Billy called me Judge",
    "right from the start, and wouldn\u2019t be corrected.)",
    "\u201cJudge, I\u2019ll tell you, never mind the gossip.",
    "I liked that boy, and that boy liked me too,",
    "\u201cas good as anyone, though I\u2019m a man",
    "who should have died before he drew a breath.",
    "That\u2019s what they\u2019ll tell you now that Mark is dead.",
    "It took his death to make me out a devil;",
    "they didn\u2019t talk that way before he died.",
    "I did what I could do. I meant to save him.",
    "\u201cBut you know what we had back then for traffic.",
    "I had to go on foot, and it was hot,",
    "and it was all uphill, a mile at least,",
    "from way out there until I reached the flat,",
    "and almost that again down to the tar.",
    "If you could see me sweat! And my old heart,",
    "\u201clike a bagged hen! I wanted him to live,",
    "but did his life mean Billy had to die?",
    "I asked myself. They\u2019d call that selfish, Judge,",
    "but could they say what good it would have done",
    "for both of us to go? Oh yes, I\u2019ve heard:",
    "\u2018If Blainville had to up and lose the one,",
    "\u201ctoo bad it couldn\u2019t get shut of the other.\u2019",
    "As if the things that drove this town to hell",
    "were all my doing. As if I was a wizard.",
    "If I had dies, would that young man come back?",
    "Well, they believe it somehow. Never mind.",
    "I had to stop for breath, and that was that.",
    "\u201cI lay against that twisty pasture pine",
    "in Simpsons\u2019 field. (That tree is lively yet.",
    "You wonder how many birds have rigged a nest",
    "in all its boughs, how many spots of dew",
    "and rain and snow have come to it and gone,",
    "how many bugs have hidden in its bark.",
    "\u201cYou wonder at those things. At least I do . . .)",
    "I lay against the trunk and, looking up,",
    "saw one of those big buzzards looking down.",
    "We had them in those days, but they were rare,",
    "so maybe I was dozing even then.",
    "\u2018I hope he\u2019ll let me die before he comes.\u2019",
    "\u201cI said those words out loud, I think, as if",
    "to say a thing out loud could make a spell.",
    "I didn\u2019t want to die at all, you see.",
    "I\u2019d go in comfort anyway, I thought.",
    "The sun was out of sight, or mostly, now.",
    "Late summer afternoons! You know what I mean . . .\u201d",
    "said Billy, raising up",
    "his crippled hand to mop away the sweat",
    "his vision brought. Many times he said it:",
    "\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d he\u2019d ask or state. I nodded.",
    "He carried on: \u201cThe first thing that I saw",
    "when I woke up was that a star was out.",
    "\u201cAnd it was cool. I figured\u2014I still do\u2014",
    "I stood as good a show as any neighbor",
    "to get to paradise. Maybe I\u2019d died!",
    "That\u2019s what I thought. I even started looking",
    "out for May. (She was the better half,",
    "no doubt about it. She knew the bushes and flowers,",
    "\u201cshe knew how much I missed the sheep and pastures.)",
    "I watched a string of black duck settle in",
    "on Wagner\u2019s beaver pond. A little weasel",
    "was getting set for winter: already he wore",
    "his high white socks. I heard that pretty thrush",
    "you hear at dusk when there isn\u2019t any breeze.",
    "\u201cYou see, I wasn\u2019t churchly, but I though",
    "if heaven\u2019s worth the breath the preachers use,",
    "it\u2019ll be just like your life was at its best.",
    "You\u2019ve heard how people say, \u2018I pinched myself.\u2019",
    "By God, I did! To see if things would change.",
    "When I sat up, that little weasel dove,",
    "\u201cbut otherwise things looked about the same.",
    "It brought back maybe half a dozen times",
    "in life when things go on, but seem so right",
    "you think they\u2019ll go forever with no harm.",
    "The times I\u2019ve had like that were at the farm,",
    "when I\u2019d be working hard all day, my mind",
    "\u201chard on the job\u2014whatever: digging, shearing\u2014",
    "and then I\u2019d stop and turn, and everything",
    "was in its place, and had a kind of shine.",
    "You couldn\u2019t help but want to speak or sing.",
    "Some kind of thanks, I guess. I\u2019m not for church,",
    "I said, but there you are.",
    "I sat and watched",
    "\u201cthe ridges. They kept swallowing the light,",
    "all that white and yellow going blue.",
    "I\u2019ve always loved that business. I still do . . .\u201d",
    "And Billy loved to talk, and as he wandered,",
    "the hills took on the look that he described,",
    "as if his words were sorcery,",
    "as if the winter were summer, and moon were sun,",
    "and far from being short, the Old Year\u2019s day",
    "would last forever.",
    "\u201cThere was, and I admit it,\u201d",
    "Billy said, \u201csome bounce now in my toes.",
    "A lot more than before, and I made time.",
    "And not because poor Mark was in that hole.",
    "\u201cBy Jesus, Judge, I\u2019ll say it! I felt good.",
    "Is that what killed Mark dead? You know it isn\u2019t.",
    "For all I know, the boy was long since gone.",
    "But I went on until I came to Cammon\u2019s.",
    "I knocked the door till Elsie finished peeking",
    "through the curtains and finally opened up.",
    "\u201cI knew her all my life. I meant to speak,",
    "for all the good it ever would have done.",
    "Elsie liked to gab, but she had no phone,",
    "no more than I did. I don\u2019t know too much,",
    "but I knew it takes a telephone right here",
    "to ring another there. I meant to speak.",
    "\u201cBefore I got a word in, though, she chirped,",
    "\u2018Nice evening, Billy.\u2019 Just what I was thinking\u2026",
    "Go on and live to be an older fool",
    "than Billy, Judge. You\u2019ll never know the way",
    "I mean that, and you\u2019ll likely curse me too.",
    "She came out on the step. We turned around",
    "\u201cand watched the bullbats worrying the bugs.",
    "We saw the moon hike overtop The Bald Man.",
    "You see it from your house. You know the one?\u201d",
    "How could Fields think this was information?",
    "That mountain is the first thing that you see.",
    "And yet when Billy named a thing for me,",
    "I\u2019d listen, as if hearing Revelation.",
    "For forty years, The Bald Man\u2019s been the same.",
    "The summer folks don\u2019t put their houses there!",
    "Its giant granite dune commands the air,",
    "and summer or winter, complements the moon",
    "that wanders over it.",
    "\u201cWe talked a spell",
    "\u201cin Elsie\u2019s rooms. We talked about the town",
    "when we were young, the way it was back then\u2014",
    "pastures; fences; sheep. These scrubby woods",
    "grew up when farmers couldn\u2019t make a go.",
    "Their sons went to the city, or joined the army,",
    "or shot their bolts out slaving with machines.",
    "\u201cWe talked about all that before I told her",
    "that Mark was lying out beneath her cow.",
    "I haven\u2019t breathed a word about this, Judge,",
    "though poor old Elsie Cammon died soon after,",
    "and may God bless her! though she lied and said",
    "she tried to move me on, but I was stubborn.",
    "\u201cJudge, she",
    "\u2018Billy, you ain\u2019t magic.\u2019",
    "That\u2019s the word she used. And that\u2019s the point.",
    "It wasn\u2019t that I never meant to go",
    "and raise some help. The better neighbor figures",
    "all the walking played out Billy\u2019s mind.",
    "But Judge, I\u2019ll tell you, I felt right as rain.",
    "\u201cWe sat and drank another cup together,",
    "and talked about the weather. Little things,",
    "like people do. And when I thought of Mark",
    "down in that grave, I thought for all of us",
    "there comes a time, and maybe this is his.",
    "And sat there happy, Judge, between us two,",
    "\u201cthat it was his, not mine. Now that\u2019s all wrong,",
    "because a man gets just so many years,",
    "and I\u2019d used up a better share of them",
    "than Mark had done. And so I should have died",
    "out by that tree, for that way Mark would live.",
    "And that way, when his brothers came to fetch him,",
    "\u201chis blood would jump back in him from the ground,",
    "and Elsie\u2019s cow would fly clean up to heaven,",
    "and Elsie\u2019s fence would always be tight-strung,",
    "and that choker apple never would have grown,",
    "because old Fields had gone before his time,",
    "and Blainville would be better than it was\u2014",
    "\u201cthe sheep would all come back and browse the hills,",
    "the big old barns would still be up and plumb,",
    "there\u2019d be a foot of soil on every pasture,",
    "and no one would go marching off to war,",
    "and all our men and women would love forever . . .",
    "I stopped him there. The old man\u2019s sweat was pouring",
    "off his skin and down the tumbled bedclothes,",
    "the way mine does sometimes",
    "But not tonight.",
    "Tonight, recording this for you and you",
    "\u2014outsider, native, woman, or child\u2014",
    "but mostly for myself, as I\u2019ve confessed,",
    "I\u2019ll lie here with my story, cool, a while.",
    "A little time, while the moon plays on The Bald Man,",
    "I\u2019ll hold to it, and you can judge the rest."

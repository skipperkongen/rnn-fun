    "My objectives this morning were vague.",
    "As always I'd hike these hills\u2014",
    "a way to keep going",
    "against the odds age deals,",
    "a way to keep body and soul",
    "together, and not so much thinking",
    "as letting things steal into mind\u2014",
    "but I started counting",
    "from the very first step I took.",
    "I wore rank old boots, ill-laced,",
    "and patchwork pants.",
    "Around my neck hung the frayed",
    "lanyard of a whistle I use",
    "to summon our trio of dogs,",
    "who capered and yelped their pleasure",
    "at one of our walks,",
    "and more miraculous still,",
    "at having me for a master.",
    "It's true in a sense",
    "that I always count as I wander,",
    "though it's usually the beats of a tune",
    "(Thelonious's \"Blue Monk\"",
    "a favorite) that mark my time.",
    "These counts felt odder,",
    "better. We scattered a brood",
    "of grouse at step 91.",
    "The deerflies strafed us.",
    "At 500 a late trillium",
    "glowed by a ledge like a lotus.",
    "Right along the rain kept pounding.",
    "I was mindful of all these things",
    "but I never stopped counting.",
    "Life was good, and more.",
    "It was worthy of better response.",
    "At 1000 I thought,",
    "\u2014and counted on.",
    "Nothing was coming to mind.",
    "Nothing is coming again",
    "from my hike half the day ago",
    "with three dogs through rain",
    "but a mystic sense of well-being",
    "in quietly chanted numbers.",
    "Whatever this trance,",
    "I treasured it as a wonder",
    "not to be wrenched into meaning,",
    "as in",
    ",",
    "as in",
    ",",
    "though of those there seems no doubt."

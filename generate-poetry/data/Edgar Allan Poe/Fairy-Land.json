    "Dim vales\u2014and shadowy floods\u2014",
    "And cloudy-looking woods,",
    "Whose forms we can\u2019t discover",
    "For the tears that drip all over:",
    "Huge moons there wax and wane\u2014",
    "Again\u2014again\u2014again\u2014",
    "Every moment of the night\u2014",
    "Forever changing places\u2014",
    "And they put out the star-light",
    "With the breath from their pale faces.",
    "About twelve by the moon-dial,",
    "One more filmy than the rest",
    "(A kind which, upon trial,",
    "They have found to be the best)",
    "Comes down\u2014still down\u2014and down",
    "With its centre on the crown",
    "Of a mountain\u2019s eminence,",
    "While its wide circumference",
    "In easy drapery falls",
    "Over hamlets, over halls,",
    "Wherever they may be\u2014",
    "O\u2019er the strange woods\u2014o\u2019er the sea\u2014",
    "Over spirits on the wing\u2014",
    "Over every drowsy thing\u2014",
    "And buries them up quite",
    "In a labyrinth of light\u2014",
    "And then, how, deep! \u2014O, deep,",
    "Is the passion of their sleep.",
    "In the morning they arise,",
    "And their moony covering",
    "Is soaring in the skies,",
    "With the tempests as they toss,",
    "Like\u2014almost any thing\u2014",
    "Or a yellow Albatross.",
    "They use that moon no more",
    "For the same end as before,",
    "Videlicet, a tent\u2014",
    "Which I think extravagant:",
    "Its atomies, however,",
    "Into a shower dissever,",
    "Of which those butterflies",
    "Of Earth, who seek the skies,",
    "And so come down again",
    "(Never-contented things!)",
    "Have brought a specimen",
    "Upon their quivering wings."

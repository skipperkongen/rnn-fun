    "Lo! \u2019t is a gala night",
    "Within the lonesome latter years!",
    "An angel throng, bewinged, bedight",
    "In veils, and drowned in tears,",
    "Sit in a theatre, to see",
    "A play of hopes and fears,",
    "While the orchestra breathes fitfully",
    "The music of the spheres.",
    "Mimes, in the form of God on high,",
    "Mutter and mumble low,",
    "And hither and thither fly\u2014",
    "Mere puppets they, who come and go",
    "At bidding of vast formless things",
    "That shift the scenery to and fro,",
    "Flapping from out their Condor wings",
    "Invisible Wo!",
    "That motley drama\u2014oh, be sure",
    "It shall not be forgot!",
    "With its Phantom chased for evermore",
    "By a crowd that seize it not,",
    "Through a circle that ever returneth in",
    "To the self-same spot,",
    "And much of Madness, and more of Sin,",
    "And Horror the soul of the plot.",
    "But see, amid the mimic rout,",
    "A crawling shape intrude!",
    "A blood-red thing that writhes from out",
    "The scenic solitude!",
    "It writhes!\u2014it writhes!\u2014with mortal pangs",
    "The mimes become its food,",
    "And seraphs sob at vermin fangs",
    "In human gore imbued.",
    "Out\u2014out are the lights\u2014out all!",
    "And, over each quivering form,",
    "The curtain, a funeral pall,",
    "Comes down with the rush of a storm,",
    "While the angels, all pallid and wan,",
    "Uprising, unveiling, affirm",
    "That the play is the tragedy, \u201cMan,\u201d",
    "And its hero, the Conqueror Worm."

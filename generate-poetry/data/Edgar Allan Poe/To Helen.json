    "Helen, thy beauty is to me",
    "Like those Nic\u00e9an barks of yore,",

    "The weary, way-worn wanderer bore",
    "To his own native shore.",
    "On desperate seas long wont to roam,",
    "Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,",
    "Thy Naiad airs have brought me home",
    "To the glory that was Greece,",
    "And the grandeur that was Rome.",
    "Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche",
    "How statue-like I see thee stand,",
    "The agate lamp within thy hand!",
    "Ah, Psyche, from the regions which",
    "Are Holy-Land!"

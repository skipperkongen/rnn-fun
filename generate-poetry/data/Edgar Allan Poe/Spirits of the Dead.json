    "Thy soul shall find itself alone",
    "\u2019Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone\u2014",
    "Not one, of all the crowd, to pry",
    "Into thine hour of secrecy.",
    "Be silent in that solitude,",
    "Which is not loneliness\u2014for then",
    "The spirits of the dead who stood",
    "In life before thee are again",
    "In death around thee\u2014and their will",
    "Shall overshadow thee: be still.",
    "The night, tho\u2019 clear, shall frown\u2014",
    "And the stars shall look not down",
    "From their high thrones in the heaven,",
    "With light like Hope to mortals given\u2014",
    "But their red orbs, without beam,",
    "To thy weariness shall seem",
    "As a burning and a fever",
    "Which would cling to thee for ever.",
    "Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish,",
    "Now are visions ne\u2019er to vanish;",
    "From thy spirit shall they pass",
    "No more\u2014like dew-drop from the grass.",
    "The breeze\u2014the breath of God\u2014is still\u2014",
    "And the mist upon the hill,",
    "Shadowy\u2014shadowy\u2014yet unbroken,",
    "Is a symbol and a token\u2014",
    "How it hangs upon the trees,",
    "A mystery of mysteries!"

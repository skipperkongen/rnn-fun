    "In the greenest of our valleys",
    "By good angels tenanted,",
    "Once a fair and stately palace\u2014",
    "Radiant palace\u2014reared its head.",
    "In the monarch Thought\u2019s dominion,",
    "It stood there!",
    "Never seraph spread a pinion",
    "Over fabric half so fair!",
    "Banners yellow, glorious, golden,",
    "On its roof did float and flow",
    "(This\u2014all this\u2014was in the olden",
    "Time long ago)",
    "And every gentle air that dallied,",
    "In that sweet day,",
    "Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,",
    "A wing\u00e8d odor went away.",
    "Wanderers in that happy valley,",
    "Through two luminous windows, saw",
    "Spirits moving musically",
    "To a lute\u2019s well-tun\u00e8d law,",
    "Round about a throne where, sitting,",
    "Porphyrogene!",
    "In state his glory well befitting,",
    "The ruler of the realm was seen.",
    "And all with pearl and ruby glowing",
    "Was the fair palace door,",
    "Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing",
    "And sparkling evermore,",
    "A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty",
    "Was but to sing,",
    "In voices of surpassing beauty,",
    "The wit and wisdom of their king.",
    "But evil things, in robes of sorrow,",
    "Assailed the monarch\u2019s high estate;",
    "(Ah, let us mourn!\u2014for never morrow",
    "Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)",
    "And round about his home the glory",
    "That blushed and bloomed",
    "Is but a dim-remembered story",
    "Of the old time entombed.",
    "And travellers, now, within that valley,",
    "Through the red-litten windows see",
    "Vast forms that move fantastically",
    "To a discordant melody;",
    "While, like a ghastly rapid river,",
    "Through the pale door",
    "A hideous throng rush out forever,",
    "And laugh\u2014but smile no more."

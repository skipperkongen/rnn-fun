    "Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!",
    "Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.",

    "How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,",
    "Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering",
    "To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,",
    "Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?",
    "Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,",
    "And driven the Hamadryad from the wood",
    "To seek a shelter in some happier star?",
    "Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,",
    "The Elfin from the green grass, and from me",
    "The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?"

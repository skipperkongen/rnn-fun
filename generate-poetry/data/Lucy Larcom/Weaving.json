    "All day she stands before her loom;",
    "The flying shuttles come and go:",
    "By grassy fields, and trees in bloom,",
    "She sees the winding river flow:",
    "And fancy\u2019s shuttle flieth wide,",
    "And faster than the waters glide.",
    "Is she entangled in her dreams,",
    "Like that fair-weaver of Shalott,",
    "Who left her mystic mirror\u2019s gleams,",
    "To gaze on light Sir Lancelot?",
    "Her heart, a mirror sadly true,",
    "Brings gloomier visions into view.",
    "\u201cI weave, and weave, the livelong day:",
    "The woof is strong, the warp is good:",
    "I weave, to be my mother\u2019s stay;",
    "I weave, to win my daily food:",
    "But ever as I weave,\u201d saith she,",
    "\u201cThe world of women haunteth me.",
    "\u201cThe river glides along, one thread",
    "In nature\u2019s mesh, so beautiful!",
    "The stars are woven in; the red",
    "Of sunrise; and the rain-cloud dull.",
    "Each seems a separate wonder wrought;",
    "Each blends with some more wondrous thought.",
    "\u201cSo, at the loom of life, we weave",
    "Our separate shreds, that varying fall,",
    "Some strained, some fair: and, passing, leave",
    "To God the gathering up of all,",
    "In that full pattern wherein man",
    "Works blindly out the eternal plan.",
    "\u201cIn his vast work, for good or ill,",
    "The undone and the done he blends:",
    "With whatsoever woof we fill,",
    "To our weak hands His might He lends,",
    "And gives the threads beneath His eye",
    "The texture of eternity.",
    "\u201cWind on, by willow and by pine,",
    "Thou blue, untroubled Merrimack!",
    "Afar, by sunnier streams than thine,",
    "My sisters toil, with foreheads black;",
    "And water with their blood this root,",
    "Whereof we gather bounteous fruit.",
    "\u201cThere be sad women, sick and poor:",
    "And those who walk in garments soiled:",
    "Their shame, their sorrow, I endure;",
    "By their defect my hope is foiled:",
    "The blot they bear is on my name;",
    "Who sins, and I am not to blame?",
    "\u201cAnd how much of your wrong is mine,",
    "Dark women slaving at the South?",
    "Of your stolen grapes I quaff the wine;",
    "The bread you starve for fills my mouth:",
    "The beam unwinds, but every thread",
    "With blood of strangled souls is red.",
    "\u201cIf this be so, we win and wear",
    "A Nessus-robe of poisoned cloth;",
    "Or weave them shrouds they may not wear,\u2014",
    "Fathers and brothers falling both",
    "On ghastly, death-sown fields, that lie",
    "Beneath the tearless Southern sky.",
    "\u201cAlas! the weft has lost its white.",
    "It grows a hideous tapestry,",
    "That pictures war\u2019s abhorrent sight:\u2014",
    "Unroll not, web of destiny!",
    "Be the dark volume left unread,\u2014",
    "The tale untold,\u2014the curse unsaid!\u201d",
    "So up and down before her loom",
    "She paces on, and to and fro,",
    "Till sunset fills the dusty room,",
    "And makes the water redly glow,",
    "As if the Merrimack\u2019s calm flood",
    "Were changed into a stream of blood.",
    "Too soon fulfilled, and all too true",
    "The words she murmured as she wrought:",
    "But, weary weaver, not to you",
    "Alone was war\u2019s stern message brought:",
    "\u201cWoman!\u201d it knelled from heart to heart,",
    "\u201cThy sister\u2019s keeper know thou art!\u201d"

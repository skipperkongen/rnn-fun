    "Invoked every sundown, it\u2019s you, painted on clouds",
    "rouging our treasured plain and all who walk it,",
    "with leaf-fresh kids and women damp from traveling,",
    "city-bound, in the radiance of a just-stopped shower;",
    "it\u2019s you, mother eternally young, courtesy of death\u2019s",
    "plucking hand, rose at the fragrant point of unpetaling,",
    "you who are the alpha of every neurosis, every torturing anxiety,",
    "and for this I give you gratitude for time past, time present, time future."

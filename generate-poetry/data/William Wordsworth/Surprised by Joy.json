    "Surprised by joy\u2014impatient as the Wind",
    "I turned to share the transport\u2014Oh! with whom",
    "But Thee, long buried in the silent Tomb,",
    "That spot which no vicissitude can find?",
    "Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind\u2014",
    "But how could I forget thee?\u2014Through what power,",
    "Even for the least division of an hour,",
    "Have I been so beguiled as to be blind",
    "To my most grievous loss!\u2014That thought\u2019s return",
    "Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,",
    "Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,",
    "Knowing my heart\u2019s best treasure was no more;",
    "That neither present time, nor years unborn",
    "Could to my sight that heavenly face restore."

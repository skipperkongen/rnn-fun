    "I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,",
    "As being past away.\u0097Vain sympathies!",
    "For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,",
    "I see what was, and is, and will abide;",
    "Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;",
    "The Form remains, the Function never dies;",
    "While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,",
    "We Men, who in our morn of youth defied",
    "The elements, must vanish;\u0097be it so!",
    "Enough, if something from our hands have power",
    "To live, and act, and serve the future hour;",
    "And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,",
    "Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,",
    "We feel that we are greater than we know."

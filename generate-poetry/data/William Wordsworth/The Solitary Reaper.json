    "Behold her, single in the field,",
    "Yon solitary Highland Lass!",
    "Reaping and singing by herself;",
    "Stop here, or gently pass!",
    "Alone she cuts and binds the grain,",
    "And sings a melancholy strain;",
    "O listen! for the Vale profound",
    "Is overflowing with the sound.",
    "No Nightingale did ever chaunt",
    "More welcome notes to weary bands",
    "Of travellers in some shady haunt,",
    "Among Arabian sands:",
    "A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard",
    "In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,",
    "Breaking the silence of the seas",
    "Among the farthest Hebrides.",
    "Will no one tell me what she sings?\u2014",
    "Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow",
    "For old, unhappy, far-off things,",
    "And battles long ago:",
    "Or is it some more humble lay,",
    "Familiar matter of to-day?",
    "Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,",
    "That has been, and may be again?",
    "Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang",
    "As if her song could have no ending;",
    "I saw her singing at her work,",
    "And o'er the sickle bending;\u2014",
    "I listened, motionless and still;",
    "And, as I mounted up the hill,",
    "The music in my heart I bore,",
    "Long after it was heard no more."

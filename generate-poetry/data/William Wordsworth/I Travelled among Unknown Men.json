    "I travelled among unknown men,",
    "In lands beyond the sea;",
    "Nor, England! did I know till then",
    "What love I bore to thee.",
    "'Tis past, that melancholy dream!",
    "Nor will I quit thy shore",
    "A second time; for still I seem",
    "To love thee more and more.",
    "Among thy mountains did I feel",
    "The joy of my desire;",
    "And she I cherished turned her wheel",
    "Beside an English fire.",
    "Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,",
    "The bowers where Lucy played;",
    "And thine too is the last green field",
    "That Lucy's eyes surveyed."

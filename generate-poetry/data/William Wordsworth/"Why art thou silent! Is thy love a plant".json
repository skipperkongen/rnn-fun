    "Why art thou silent! Is thy love a plant",
    "Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air",
    "Of absence withers what was once so fair?",
    "Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?",
    "Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant\u2014",
    "Bound to thy service with unceasing care,",
    "The mind\u2019s least generous wish a mendicant",
    "For nought but what thy happiness could spare.",
    "Speak\u2014 though this soft warm heart, once free to hold",
    "A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,",
    "Be left more desolate, more dreary cold",
    "Than a forsaken bird\u2019s-nest filled with snow",
    "\u2018Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine\u2014",
    "Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know."

    "The world is too much with us; late and soon,",
    "Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;\u2014",
    "Little we see in Nature that is ours;",
    "We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!",
    "This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;",
    "The winds that will be howling at all hours,",
    "And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;",
    "For this, for everything, we are out of tune;",
    "It moves us not. Great God! I\u2019d rather be",
    "A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;",
    "So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,",
    "Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;",
    "Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;",
    "Or hear old Triton blow his wreath\u00e8d horn."

    "O Friend! I know not which way I must look",
    "For comfort, being, as I am, opprest,",
    "To think that now our life is only drest",
    "For show; mean handy-work of craftsman, cook,",
    "Or groom! \u0097 We must run glittering like a brook",
    "In the open sunshine, or we are unblest:",
    "The wealthiest man among us is the best:",
    "No grandeur now in nature or in book",
    "Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense,",
    "This is idolatry; and these we adore:",
    "Plain living and high thinking are no more:",
    "The homely beauty of the good old cause",
    "Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence,",
    "And pure religion breathing household laws."

    "Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,",
    "With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned\u0097",
    "Albeit labouring for a scanty band",
    "Of white-robed Scholars only\u0097this immense",
    "And glorious Work of fine intelligence!",
    "Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore",
    "Of nicely-calculated less or more;",
    "So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense",
    "These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof",
    "Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,",
    "Where light and shade repose, where music dwells",
    "Lingering\u0097and wandering on as loth to die;",
    "Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof",
    "That they were born for immortality."

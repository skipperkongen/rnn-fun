    "I",
    "\u201cThere is a Thorn\u2014it looks so old,",
    "In truth, you\u2019d find it hard to say",
    "How it could ever have been young,",
    "It looks so old and grey.",
    "Not higher than a two years' child",
    "It stands erect, this aged Thorn;",
    "No leaves it has, no prickly points;",
    "It is a mass of knotted joints,",
    "A wretched thing forlorn.",
    "It stands erect, and like a stone",
    "With lichens is it overgrown.",
    "II",
    "\u201cLike rock or stone, it is o\u2019ergrown,",
    "With lichens to the very top,",
    "And hung with heavy tufts of moss,",
    "A melancholy crop:",
    "Up from the earth these mosses creep,",
    "And this poor Thorn they clasp it round",
    "So close, you\u2019d say that they are bent",
    "With plain and manifest intent",
    "To drag it to the ground;",
    "And all have joined in one endeavour",
    "To bury this poor Thorn for ever.",
    "III",
    "\u201cHigh on a mountain\u2019s highest ridge,",
    "Where oft the stormy winter gale",
    "Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds",
    "It sweeps from vale to vale;",
    "Not five yards from the mountain path,",
    "This Thorn you on your left espy;",
    "And to the left, three yards beyond,",
    "You see a little muddy pond",
    "Of water\u2014never dry,",
    "Though but of compass small, and bare",
    "To thirsty suns and parching air.",
    "IV",
    "\u201cAnd, close beside this aged Thorn,",
    "There is a fresh and lovely sight,",
    "A beauteous heap, a hill of moss,",
    "Just half a foot in height.",
    "All lovely colours there you see,",
    "All colours that were ever seen;",
    "And mossy network too is there,",
    "As if by hand of lady fair",
    "The work had woven been;",
    "And cups, the darlings of the eye,",
    "So deep is their vermilion dye.",
    "V",
    "\u201cAh me! what lovely tints are there",
    "Of olive green and scarlet bright,",
    "In spikes, in branches, and in stars,",
    "Green, red, and pearly white!",
    "This heap of earth o\u2019ergrown with moss,",
    "Which close beside the Thorn you see,",
    "So fresh in all its beauteous dyes,",
    "Is like an infant\u2019s grave in size,",
    "As like as like can be:",
    "But never, never any where,",
    "An infant\u2019s grave was half so fair.",
    "VI",
    "\u201cNow would you see this aged Thorn,",
    "This pond, and beauteous hill of moss,",
    "You must take care and choose your time",
    "The mountain when to cross.",
    "For oft there sits between the heap,",
    "So like an infant\u2019s grave in size,",
    "And that same pond of which I spoke,",
    "A Woman in a scarlet cloak,",
    "And to herself she cries,",
    "\u2018\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!",
    "Oh woe is me! oh misery!\u2019\ufeff",
    "VII",
    "\u201cAt all times of the day and night",
    "This wretched Woman thither goes;",
    "And she is known to every star,",
    "And every wind that blows;",
    "And there, beside the Thorn, she sits",
    "When the blue daylight\u2019s in the skies,",
    "And when the whirlwind\u2019s on the hill,",
    "Or frosty air is keen and still,",
    "And to herself she cries,",
    "\u2018\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!",
    "Oh woe is me! oh misery!\u2019 \u201d",
    "VIII",
    "\u201cNow wherefore, thus, by day and night,",
    "In rain, in tempest, and in snow,",
    "Thus to the dreary mountain-top",
    "Does this poor Woman go?",
    "And why sits she beside the Thorn",
    "When the blue daylight\u2019s in the sky",
    "Or when the whirlwind\u2019s on the hill,",
    "Or frosty air is keen and still,",
    "And wherefore does she cry?\u2014",
    "O wherefore? wherefore? tell me why",
    "Does she repeat that doleful cry?\u201d",
    "IX",
    "\u201cI cannot tell; I wish I could;",
    "For the true reason no one knows:",
    "But would you gladly view the spot,",
    "The spot to which she goes;",
    "The hillock like an infant\u2019s grave,",
    "The pond\u2014and Thorn, so old and grey;",
    "Pass by her door\u2014\u2019tis seldom shut\u2014",
    "And if you see her in her hut\u2014",
    "Then to the spot away!",
    "I never heard of such as dare",
    "Approach the spot when she is there.\u201d",
    "X",
    "\u201cBut wherefore to the mountain-top",
    "Can this unhappy Woman go,",
    "Whatever star is in the skies,",
    "Whatever wind may blow?\u201d",
    "\u201cFull twenty years are past and gone",
    "Since she (her name is Martha Ray)",
    "Gave with a maiden\u2019s true good-will",
    "Her company to Stephen Hill;",
    "And she was blithe and gay,",
    "While friends and kindred all approved",
    "Of him whom tenderly she loved.",
    "XI",
    "\u201cAnd they had fixed the wedding day,",
    "The morning that must wed them both;",
    "But Stephen to another Maid",
    "Had sworn another oath;",
    "And, with this other Maid, to church",
    "Unthinking Stephen went\u2014",
    "Poor Martha! on that woeful day",
    "A pang of pitiless dismay",
    "Into her soul was sent;",
    "A fire was kindled in her breast,",
    "Which might not burn itself to rest.",
    "XII",
    "\u201cThey say, full six months after this,",
    "While yet the summer leaves were green,",
    "She to the mountain-top would go,",
    "And there was often seen.",
    "What could she seek?\u2014or wish to hide?",
    "Her state to any eye was plain;",
    "She was with child, and she was mad;",
    "Yet often was she sober sad",
    "From her exceeding pain.",
    "O guilty Father\u2014would that death",
    "Had saved him from that breach of faith!",
    "XIII",
    "\u201cSad case for such a brain to hold",
    "Communion with a stirring child!",
    "Sad case, as you may think, for one",
    "Who had a brain so wild!",
    "Last Christmas-eve we talked of this,",
    "And grey-haired Wilfred of the glen",
    "Held that the unborn infant wrought",
    "About its mother\u2019s heart, and brought",
    "Her senses back again:",
    "And, when at last her time drew near,",
    "Her looks were calm, her senses clear.",
    "XIV",
    "\u201cMore know I not, I wish I did,",
    "And it should all be told to you;",
    "For what became of this poor child",
    "No mortal ever knew;",
    "Nay\u2014if a child to her was born",
    "No earthly tongue could ever tell;",
    "And if \u2019twas born alive or dead,",
    "Far less could this with proof be said;",
    "But some remember well,",
    "That Martha Ray about this time",
    "Would up the mountain often climb.",
    "XV",
    "\u201cAnd all that winter, when at night",
    "The wind blew from the mountain-peak,",
    "\u2019Twas worth your while, though in the dark,",
    "The churchyard path to seek:",
    "For many a time and oft were heard",
    "Cries coming from the mountain head:",
    "Some plainly living voices were;",
    "And others, I\u2019ve heard many swear,",
    "Were voices of the dead:",
    "I cannot think, whate\u2019er they say,",
    "They had to do with Martha Ray.",
    "XVI",
    "\u201cBut that she goes to this old Thorn,",
    "The Thorn which I described to you,",
    "And there sits in a scarlet cloak,",
    "I will be sworn is true.",
    "For one day with my telescope,",
    "To view the ocean wide and bright,",
    "When to this country first I came,",
    "Ere I had heard of Martha\u2019s name,",
    "I climbed the mountain\u2019s height:\u2014",
    "A storm came on, and I could see",
    "No object higher than my knee.",
    "XVII",
    "\u201c \u2019Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain:",
    "No screen, no fence could I discover;",
    "And then the wind! in sooth, it was",
    "A wind full ten times over.",
    "I looked around, I thought I saw",
    "A jutting crag,\u2014and off I ran,",
    "Head-foremost, through the driving rain,",
    "The shelter of the crag to gain;",
    "And, as I am a man,",
    "Instead of jutting crag, I found",
    "A Woman seated on the ground.",
    "XVIII",
    "\u201cI did not speak\u2014I saw her face;",
    "Her face!\u2014it was enough for me;",
    "I turned about and heard her cry,",
    "\u2018\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!\u2019\ufeff",
    "And there she sits, until the moon",
    "Through half the clear blue sky will go;",
    "And when the little breezes make",
    "The waters of the pond to shake,",
    "As all the country know,",
    "She shudders, and you hear her cry,",
    "\u2018\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!\u2019 \u201d",
    "XIX",
    "\u201cBut what\u2019s the Thorn? and what the pond?",
    "And what the hill of moss to her?",
    "And what the creeping breeze that comes",
    "The little pond to stir?\u201d",
    "\u201cI cannot tell; but some will say",
    "She hanged her baby on the tree;",
    "Some say she drowned it in the pond,",
    "Which is a little step beyond:",
    "But all and each agree,",
    "The little Babe was buried there,",
    "Beneath that hill of moss so fair.",
    "XX",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve heard, the moss is spotted red",
    "With drops of that poor infant\u2019s blood;",
    "But kill a new-born infant thus,",
    "I do not think she could!",
    "Some say, if to the pond you go,",
    "And fix on it a steady view,",
    "The shadow of a babe you trace,",
    "A baby and a baby\u2019s face,",
    "And that it looks at you;",
    "Whene\u2019er you look on it, \u2019tis plain",
    "The baby looks at you again.",
    "XXI",
    "\u201cAnd some had sworn an oath that she",
    "Should be to public justice brought;",
    "And for the little infant\u2019s bones",
    "With spades they would have sought.",
    "But instantly the hill of moss",
    "Before their eyes began to stir!",
    "And, for full fifty yards around,",
    "The grass\u2014it shook upon the ground!",
    "Yet all do still aver",
    "The little Babe lies buried there,",
    "Beneath that hill of moss so fair.",
    "XXII",
    "\u201cI cannot tell how this may be,",
    "But plain it is the Thorn is bound",
    "With heavy tufts of moss that strive",
    "To drag it to the ground;",
    "And this I know, full many a time,",
    "When she was on the mountain high,",
    "By day, and in the silent night,",
    "When all the stars shone clear and bright,",
    "That I have heard her cry,",

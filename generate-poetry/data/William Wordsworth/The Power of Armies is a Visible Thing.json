    "The power of Armies is a visible thing,",
    "Formal and circumscribed in time and space;",
    "But who the limits of that power shall trace",
    "Which a brave People into light can bring",
    "Or hide, at will,\u0097for freedom combating",
    "By just revenge inflamed? No foot may chase,",
    "No eye can follow, to a fatal place",
    "That power, that spirit, whether on the wing",
    "Like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind",
    "Within its awful caves.\u0097From year to year",
    "Springs this indigenous produce far and near;",
    "No craft this subtle element can bind,",
    "Rising like water from the soil, to find",
    "In every nook a lip that it may cheer."

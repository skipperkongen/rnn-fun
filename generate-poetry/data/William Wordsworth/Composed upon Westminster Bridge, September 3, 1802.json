    "Earth has not anything to show more fair:",
    "Dull would he be of soul who could pass by",
    "A sight so touching in its majesty:",
    "This City now doth, like a garment, wear",
    "The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,",
    "Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie",
    "Open unto the fields, and to the sky;",
    "All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.",
    "Never did sun more beautifully steep",
    "In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;",
    "Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!",
    "The river glideth at his own sweet will:",
    "Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;",
    "And all that mighty heart is lying still!"

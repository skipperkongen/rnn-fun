    "\u2014\u2014\u2014A simple Child,",
    "That lightly draws its breath,",
    "And feels its life in every limb,",
    "What should it know of death?",
    "I met a little cottage Girl:",
    "She was eight years old, she said;",
    "Her hair was thick with many a curl",
    "That clustered round her head.",
    "She had a rustic, woodland air,",
    "And she was wildly clad:",
    "Her eyes were fair, and very fair;",
    "\u2014Her beauty made me glad.",
    "\u201cSisters and brothers, little Maid,",
    "How many may you be?\u201d",
    "\u201cHow many? Seven in all,\u201d she said,",
    "And wondering looked at me.",
    "\u201cAnd where are they? I pray you tell.\u201d",
    "She answered, \u201cSeven are we;",
    "And two of us at Conway dwell,",
    "And two are gone to sea.",
    "\u201cTwo of us in the church-yard lie,",
    "My sister and my brother;",
    "And, in the church-yard cottage, I",
    "Dwell near them with my mother.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou say that two at Conway dwell,",
    "And two are gone to sea,",
    "Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,",
    "Sweet Maid, how this may be.\u201d",
    "Then did the little Maid reply,",
    "\u201cSeven boys and girls are we;",
    "Two of us in the church-yard lie,",
    "Beneath the church-yard tree.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou run about, my little Maid,",
    "Your limbs they are alive;",
    "If two are in the church-yard laid,",
    "Then ye are only five.\u201d",
    "\u201cTheir graves are green, they may be seen,\u201d",
    "The little Maid replied,",
    "\u201cTwelve steps or more from my mother\u2019s door,",
    "And they are side by side.",
    "\u201cMy stockings there I often knit,",
    "My kerchief there I hem;",
    "And there upon the ground I sit,",
    "And sing a song to them.",
    "\u201cAnd often after sun-set, Sir,",
    "When it is light and fair,",
    "I take my little porringer,",
    "And eat my supper there.",
    "\u201cThe first that dies was sister Jane;",
    "In bed she moaning lay,",
    "Till God released her of her pain;",
    "And then she went away.",
    "\u201cSo in the church-yard she was laid;",
    "And, when the grass was dry,",
    "Together round her grave we played,",
    "My brother John and I.",
    "\u201cAnd when the ground was white with snow,",
    "And I could run and slide,",
    "My brother John was forced to go,",
    "And he lies by her side.\u201d",
    "\u201cHow many are you, then,\u201d said I,",
    "\u201cIf they two are in heaven?\u201d",
    "Quick was the little Maid\u2019s reply,",
    "\u201cO Master! we are seven.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut they are dead; those two are dead!",
    "Their spirits are in heaven!\u201d",
    "\u2019Twas throwing words away; for still",
    "The little Maid would have her will,",
    "And said, \u201cNay, we are seven!\u201d"

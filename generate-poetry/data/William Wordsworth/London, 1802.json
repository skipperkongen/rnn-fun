    "Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour:",
    "England hath need of thee: she is a fen",
    "Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,",
    "Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,",
    "Have forfeited their ancient English dower",
    "Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;",
    "Oh! raise us up, return to us again;",
    "And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.",
    "Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:",
    "Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:",
    "Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,",
    "So didst thou travel on life's common way,",
    "In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart",
    "The lowliest duties on herself did lay."

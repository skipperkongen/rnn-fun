    "Nuns fret not at their convent\u2019s narrow room;",
    "And hermits are contented with their cells;",
    "And students with their pensive citadels;",
    "Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,",
    "Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,",
    "High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,",
    "Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:",
    "In truth the prison, into which we doom",
    "Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,",
    "In sundry moods, \u2019twas pastime to be bound",
    "Within the Sonnet\u2019s scanty plot of ground;",
    "Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)",
    "Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,",
    "Should find brief solace there, as I have found."

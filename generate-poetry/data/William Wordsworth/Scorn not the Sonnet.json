    "Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned,",
    "Mindless of its just honours; with this key",
    "Shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody",
    "Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;",
    "A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;",
    "With it Cam\u00f6ens soothed an exile's grief;",
    "The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf",
    "Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned",
    "His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,",
    "It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land",
    "To struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp",
    "Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand",
    "The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew",
    "Soul-animating strains\u2014alas, too few!"

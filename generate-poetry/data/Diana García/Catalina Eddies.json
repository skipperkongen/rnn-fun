    "Dusk to dawn, sleek skunks enjoy",
    "avocados in my yard. I give wide berth.",
    "Before the first jogger leaves her prints",
    "on pavement, tough raccoons appear.",
    "They pretend they don\u2019t hear my keys click",
    "but they peek to make sure it\u2019s me.",
    "Foxes play hide-and-seek,",
    "sometimes on our lawn, other times",
    "across the street, but never after seven;",
    "and brazen squirrels eye me",
    "from the center of the street,",
    "dare me to approach.",
    "Will this be a day for Catalina eddies,",
    "clouds stacked, catching like magnets",
    "in a liquid air swirl?",
    "Or will it blow a fierce Santa Ana,",
    "days of fires in the hills,",
    "smoldering chaparral,",
    "winds so fierce birds do low-crawls?",
    "I cast a spell for Santa Anas",
    "the shallow coast a censer",
    "mixed with black sage, Torrey Pine,",
    "Engelmann oak\u2014precious oils",
    "to fumigate the San Diego skies,",
    "the annual burning pulse."

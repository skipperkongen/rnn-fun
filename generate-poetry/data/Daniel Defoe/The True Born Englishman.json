    "Thus from a mixture of all kinds began,",
    "That het\u2019rogeneous thing, an Englishman:",
    "In eager rapes, and furious lust begot,",
    "Betwixt a painted Britain and a Scot.",
    "Whose gend\u2019ring off-spring quickly learn\u2019d to bow,",
    "And yoke their heifers to the Roman plough:",
    "From whence a mongrel half-bred race there came,",
    "With neither name, nor nation, speech nor fame.",
    "In whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran,",
    "Infus\u2019d betwixt a Saxon and a Dane.",
    "While their rank daughters, to their parents just,",
    "Receiv\u2019d all nations with promiscuous lust.",
    "This nauseous brood directly did contain",
    "The well-extracted blood of Englishmen.",
    "Which medly canton\u2019d in a heptarchy,",
    "A rhapsody of nations to supply,",
    "Among themselves maintain\u2019d eternal wars,",
    "And still the ladies lov\u2019d the conquerors.",
    "The western Angles all the rest subdu\u2019d;",
    "A bloody nation, barbarous and rude:",
    "Who by the tenure of the sword possest",
    "One part of Britain, and subdu\u2019d the rest",
    "And as great things denominate the small,",
    "The conqu\u2019ring part gave title to the whole.",
    "The Scot, Pict, Britain, Roman, Dane, submit,",
    "And with the English-Saxon all unite:",
    "And these the mixture have so close pursu\u2019d,",
    "The very name and memory\u2019s subdu\u2019d:",
    "No Roman now, no Britain does remain;",
    "Wales strove to separate, but strove in vain:",
    "The silent nations undistinguish\u2019d fall,",
    "And Englishman\u2019s the common name for all.",
    "Fate jumbled them together, God knows how;",
    "What e\u2019er they were they\u2019re true-born English now.",
    "The wonder which remains is at our pride,",
    "To value that which all wise men deride.",
    "For Englishmen to boast of generation,",
    "Cancels their knowledge, and lampoons the nation.",
    "A true-born Englishman\u2019s a contradiction,",
    "In speech an irony, in fact a fiction.",
    "A banter made to be a test of fools,",
    "Which those that use it justly ridicules.",
    "A metaphor invented to express",
    "A man a-kin to all the universe.",
    "For as the Scots, as learned men ha\u2019 said,",
    "Throughout the world their wand\u2019ring seed ha\u2019 spread;",
    "So open-handed England, \u2019tis believ\u2019d,",
    "Has all the gleanings of the world receiv\u2019d.",
    "Some think of England \u2019twas our Saviour meant,",
    "The Gospel should to all the world be sent:",
    "Since, when the blessed sound did hither reach,",
    "They to all nations might be said to preach.",
    "\u2019Tis well that virtue gives nobility,",
    "How shall we else the want of birth and blood supply?",
    "Since scarce one family is left alive,",
    "Which does not from some foreigner derive."

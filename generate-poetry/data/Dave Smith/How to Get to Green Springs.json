    "Nobody knows exactly when it fell off the map",
    "or what the pressures were on its flooding river.",
    "The hedge, the tottering mailbox, were gone. That dimple",
    "of light from the bicycle that raised itself to creak",
    "at noon across a clattering bridge names my father.",
    "His blood silent as a surging wish drags this town",
    "lost through my body, a place I can get back to only",
    "by hunch and a train whistle that was right on time.",
    "But time and trains were never right in Green Springs,",
    "West Virginia. What color could map the coal\u2019s grime,",
    "shacks shored against the river every March, mail",
    "left to rot because no one answered to occupant?",
    "Farmers low on sugar cursed the heat and left bad cigars",
    "boys would puff back to clouds where they dreamed",
    "of girls naked as their hands under outfield flies.",
    "Scores were low. There were no springs for the sick.",
    "Women lined their walls with the Sears catalog, but",
    "the only fur they ever had was a warbled rabbit.",
    "To get here think of dirt, think of night leaking,",
    "the tick of waterbugs, a train held in Pittsburgh."

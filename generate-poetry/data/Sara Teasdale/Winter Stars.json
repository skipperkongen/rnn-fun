    "I went out at night alone;",
    "The young blood flowing beyond the sea",
    "Seemed to have drenched my spirit\u2019s wings\u2014",
    "I bore my sorrow heavily.",
    "But when I lifted up my head",
    "From shadows shaken on the snow,",
    "I saw Orion in the east",
    "Burn steadily as long ago.",
    "From windows in my father\u2019s house,",
    "Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,",
    "I watched Orion as a girl",
    "Above another city\u2019s lights.",
    "Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too,",
    "The world\u2019s heart breaks beneath its wars,",
    "All things are changed, save in the east",
    "The faithful beauty of the stars."

    "I saw her in a Broadway car,",
    "The woman I might grow to be;",
    "I felt my lover look at her",
    "And then turn suddenly to me.",
    "Her hair was dull and drew no light",
    "And yet its color was as mine;",
    "Her eyes were strangely like my eyes",
    "Tho' love had never made them shine.",
    "Her body was a thing grown thin,",
    "Hungry for love that never came;",
    "Her soul was frozen in the dark",
    "Unwarmed forever by love's flame.",
    "I felt my lover look at her",
    "And then turn suddenly to me, \u0097",
    "His eyes were magic to defy",
    "The woman I shall never be."

    "Man, the egregious egoist,",

    "Of the intolerable load",
    "Which on all living creatures lies,",
    "Nor stoops to pity in the toad",
    "The speechless sorrow of its eyes.",
    "He asks no questions of the snake,",
    "Nor plumbs the phosphorescent gloom",
    "Where lidless fishes, broad awake,",
    "Swim staring at a night-mare doom."

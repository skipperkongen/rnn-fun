    "I shall not sprinkle with dust",
    "A creature so clearly lunar;",
    "You must die\u2014but of course you must\u2014",
    "And better later than sooner.",
    "But if it should be in a year",
    "That year itself must perish;",
    "How dingy a thing is fear,",
    "And sorrow, how dull to cherish!",
    "And if it should be in a day",
    "That day would be dark by evening,",
    "But the morning might still be gay",
    "And the moon have golden leavening.",
    "And beauty\u2019s a moonlight grist",
    "That comes to the mills of dying;",
    "The silver grain may be missed",
    "But there\u2019s no great good in crying.",
    "Though luminous things are mould",
    "They survive in a glance that crossed them,",
    "And it\u2019s not very kind to scold",
    "The empty air that has lost them.",
    "The limpid blossom of youth",
    "Turns into a poison berry;",
    "Having perceived this truth",
    "I shall not weep but be merry.",
    "Therefore die when you please;",
    "It\u2019s not very wise to worry;",
    "I shall not shiver and freeze;",
    "I shall not even be sorry.",
    "Beautiful things are wild;",
    "They are gone, and you go after;",
    "Therefore I mean, my child,",
    "To charm your going with laughter.",
    "Love and pity are strong,",
    "But wisdom is happily greater;",
    "You will die, I suppose, before long,"

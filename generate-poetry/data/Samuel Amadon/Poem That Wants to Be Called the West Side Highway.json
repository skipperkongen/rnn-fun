    "You can do the work just by starting it. You can",
    "do whatever you want. A bill",
    "is drafted on a train to Albany, or in a black",
    "limousine. Like how one day I walked",
    "the entire length of Manhattan, except I didn\u2019t.",
    "I didn\u2019t finish. Not nearly. How could I?",
    "Stopped as I was by the boat basin. These",

    "I get a little lost sometimes,",
    "start thinking I went to Yale. Once I swam",
    "to Governors Island, between the ferries",
    "and freighters. It was like a job you should\u2019ve seen",
    "me quit. Maybe they looked for me. Maybe",
    "it wasn\u2019t someone else\u2019s shift, and then",
    "it was. Sometimes people are just turnstiles.",
    "You have to tell them to keep",
    "turning, keep turning into someone else. The rain",
    "crashes across a cab, and the road",
    "has filled. We\u2019re waterborne. Or whatever",
    "the word is for that little moment",
    "when the heart lifts. Why don\u2019t you devote",
    "yourself the way you once did? It\u2019s",
    "an old answer, and an early",
    "one. The alarm goes off for a while after it",
    "stops. In your face in the bathroom",
    "mirror. You play that little song to look at",
    "your teeth. My teeth. They haven\u2019t been cared for.",
    "The class giggles at my age. This is",
    "my hearing. The chances taken on a new face."

    "How wonderful to be understood,",
    "to just sit here while some kind person",
    "relieves you of the awful burden",
    "of having to explain yourself, of having",
    "to find other words to say what you meant,",
    "or what you think you thought you meant,",
    "and of the worse burden of finding no words,",
    "of being struck dumb . . . because some bright person",
    "has found just the right words for you\u2014and you",
    "have only to sit here and be grateful",
    "for words so quiet so discerning they seem",
    "not words but literate light, in which",
    "your merely lucid blossoming grows lustrous.",
    "How wonderful that is!",
    "And how altogether wonderful it is",
    "not to be understood, not at all, to, well,",
    "just sit here while someone not unkindly",
    "is saying those impossibly wrong things,",
    "or quite possibly they\u2019re the right things",
    "if you are, which you\u2019re not, that someone",
    "\u2014a difference, finally, so indifferent",
    "it would be conceit not to let it pass,",
    "unkindness, really, to spoil someone\u2019s fun.",
    "And so you don\u2019t mind, you welcome the umbrage",
    "of those high murmurings over your head,",
    "having found, after all, you are grateful",
    "\u2014and you understand this, how wonderful!\u2014",
    "that you\u2019ve been led to be quietly yourself,",
    "like a root growing wise in darkness",
    "under the light litter, the falling words."

    "Here or there hundreds of them, phantom-like,",
    "bobbing in place at street corners, then",
    "lifting their knees suddenly and leaping",
    "into the densest, loudest traffic",
    "(of briefest trajectories, of shortest views),",
    "in transit yet at ease, breathing, loping,",
    "like bearers of distance and pure direction,",
    "darting half naked out of nowhere and",
    "where, where in the world are they running to?",
    "swift and solitary, silent beings",
    "who, should you now step into the path,",
    "have dodged away, or, if you raise a hand",
    "to stay them to speak, immediately",
    "are gone: who are these runners who create",
    "in their gliding such fine, singular spaces",
    "among the street\u2019s vociferous jargons?",
    "\u2014as if each one were a still, wordless message",
    "or question one would answer if one could grasp it,",
    "this one, that one, sliding past, going away,",
    "while you stand there, your hand raised to no purpose,",
    "your hidden heart rejoicing that the quick heel",
    "won\u2019t soon, won\u2019t ever, be overtaken,",
    "although you, as you have longed to, suddenly",
    "disburden yourself and follow follow."

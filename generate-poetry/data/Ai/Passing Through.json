    "\u201cEarth is the birth of the blues,\u201d sang Yellow Bertha,",
    "as she chopped cotton beside Mama Rose.",
    "It was as hot as any other summer day,",
    "when she decided to run away.",
    "Folks say she made a fortune",
    "running a whorehouse in New Orleans,",
    "but others say she\u2019s buried somewhere out west,",
    "her grave unmarked,",
    "though you can find it in the dark",
    "by the scent of jasmine and mint,",
    "but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.",
    "If it wasn\u2019t for hell,",
    "we\u2019d all be tapdancing with the devil",
    "Mama Rose used to say,",
    "but as it is, we just stand and watch,",
    "while someone else burns up before salvation.",
    "\u201cPeople desire damnation, Bertha,\u201d she said,",
    "unwrapping the rag from her head",
    "to let the sweat flow down the corn rows,",
    "plaited as tightly as the night coming down",
    "on the high and mighty on judgment day.",
    "They say she knew what was coming,",
    "because she threw some bones that morning.",
    "She bent down to pick up her rag which had fallen",
    "and when she straightened up, her yellow gal",
    "had gone down the road.",
    "\u201cGo then,\u201d she called out, \u201cI didn\u2019t want you no how.\u201d",
    "Then she started talking to herself",
    "about how Old White John caught her milking cows.",
    "\u201cHe wrestled me to the ground and did his nastiness.\u201d",
    "He said, \u201cyour daddy was a slave and his daddy",
    "and I\u2019m claiming back what\u2019s mine.\u201d",
    "It was July. I remember fireworks going off outside.",
    "When Bertha come, so white",
    "she liked to scared me to death,",
    "I let her suckle my breast",
    "and I said, \u201cAll right, little baby,",
    "maybe I\u2019ll love you. Maybe.\u201d",
    "Mama Rose said she did her best,",
    "but it\u2019s hard to raise a gal like that",
    "with everybody thinking she\u2019s giving them the high hat,",
    "because she\u2019s so light and got those green eyes",
    "that look right through you. She frightens people.",
    "Even men, who\u2019re usually wanting to saddle up",
    "and ride that kind of mare, can\u2019t abide her.",
    "They\u2019re afraid if they try her, they\u2019ll never be the same.",
    "The only ones willing are white.",
    "They\u2019re watching her day and night,",
    "but they know John swore to kill any man",
    "who touched her,",
    "because lo and behold, he owns up to her.",
    "He\u2019s proud of her. Nobody can believe it.",
    "He\u2019s even at her baptism.",
    "He buys her cheap dresses and candy at the store.",
    "He hands it to her out the door,",
    "because she can\u2019t go in.",
    "He won\u2019t, he won\u2019t stop looking at her",
    "like it\u2019s some kind of miracle she was born",
    "looking so much like him and his people.",
    "It\u2019s a warning, or something.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s evil turning back on itself,\u201d said the preacher",
    "the Sunday cut clean through by the truth,",
    "by the living proof, as Old John stood up in church",
    "and testified to the power of God,",
    "who spoke to him that morning,",
    "telling him he was a sinner.",
    "He died that winter. Horrible suffering, they say.",
    "He had a stroke on the way to town.",
    "His car ran off the road and he drowned.",
    "They say Bertha found him.",
    "They say she ran all the way to town for the doctor,",
    "who told her, \u201cI am not a colored doctor,\u201d",
    "so she went and got the sheriff.",
    "He listened for a while, then he locked her in a cell.",
    "He said he knew she was guilty of something.",
    "Well, after a while, Rose went down there",
    "and I swear she nearly had a fit.",
    "\u201cGet my daughter out here,\u201d she said.",
    "\u201cHow can you lock up your own brother\u2019s child?\u201d",
    "The sheriff knew it was true, so finally he said,",
    "\u201cYou take her and don\u2019t ever cross my path again.\u201d",
    "When Bertha passed him on the way out,",
    "he tripped her with his foot.",
    "When she got off the floor, she said,",
    "\u201cEvery dog has its day.\u201d",
    "From that time to this is a straight line,",
    "pointing at a girl,",
    "who doesn\u2019t even have shoes anymore,",
    "as she runs down the road,",
    "throwing off her ragged clothes, as she goes,",
    "until she\u2019s as naked as the day she was born.",
    "When she comes to washing hanging on the line,",
    "she grabs a fine dress and keeps on running.",
    "She\u2019s crying and laughing at the same time.",
    "Along comes a truck that says J. GOODY on the side.",
    "The man driving stops to give her a ride.",
    "He swings the door open on the passenger side,",
    "but Bertha says, \u201cMove over, I\u2019ll drive.\u201d",
    "When she asks him why he stopped,",
    "he says, \u201cI know white trash, when I see it.",
    "You\u2019re just like me, but you're a girl. You\u2019re pretty.",
    "You can free yourself. All you have to do",
    "is show a little leg and some titty in the big city.\u201d",
    "He gave her fifty cents and a wink",
    "and she started thinking she might as well turn white.",
    "She got a job waiting table in a dance hall.",
    "One night, the boss heard her",
    "singing along with the band.",
    "He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go up on stage,\u201d",
    "and she said, \u201cI play piano too.\u201d",
    "He said, \u201cHowdy do.\u201d",
    "From then on, she made everybody pay",
    "one way, or another.",
    "She got hard. She took lovers\u2014",
    "fathers, sons, and husbands.",
    "It didn't matter,",
    "but once in a while, she heard her mother\u2019s voice,",
    "saying, \u201cYou made the wrong choice,\u201d",
    "and she felt the blues",
    "and she let loose with a shout.",
    "\u201cLordy,\u201d said the boss, \u201cyou sound colored.\u201d",
    "More and more people came to hear her sing,",
    "but they kind of feared her too.",
    "They said, she was too white to sing the blues like that.",
    "It wasn\u2019t right.",
    "One night, she got to talking with the boss.",
    "He walked round and round the office, shaking his head,",
    "saying how much he\u2019d lose,",
    "if she stopped singing the blues.",
    "\u201cHow often can you find a treasure like mine,\u201d he said,",
    "laying his hand on her shoulder,",
    "then he said, \u201cIf I weren\u2019t so old,\u201d",
    "and his voice dropped off to a whisper,",
    "then he said, \u201cI got the answer now, sweet Roberta.",
    "Go on down to the dressing room and wait.\u201d",
    "It didn't take long.",
    "He came in and set a jar on the table.",
    "\u201cWhat do I do with this?\u201d Asked Bertha.",
    "He said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to pass for colored.\u201d",
    "Suddenly, she was wearing blackface.",
    "Suddenly, she was safe on the other side",
    "of the door she slammed on the past",
    "and it was standing open at last.",
    "She could come and go as she pleased",
    "and no one saw her enter, or leave.",
    "She was free, she was freed,",
    "but she didn\u2019t feel it",
    "and she needed it to be real.",
    "She went on, though. She flowed like a river,",
    "carrying the body of a man,",
    "who had himself a nigger, because he could.",
    "She lived. She got old.",
    "She almost froze one cold spell",
    "and she got up from her sickbed",
    "and told her daughter",
    "she got during the change of life",
    "it was time to go.",
    "She sewed a note to her ragged coat.",
    "It said, \u201c",
    "\u201d",
    "She put fifty cents in her hand",
    "and went to stand with her at the bus stop.",
    "She would not return, but her child",
    "had earned the right to go home.",
    "When I got off the bus,",
    "a hush fell over the people waiting there.",
    "I was as white as my mother,",
    "but my eyes were gray, not green.",
    "I had hair down to my waist and braids so thick",
    "they weighed me down.",
    "Mother said, my father was a white musician",
    "from another town,",
    "who found out her secret",
    "and left her and me to keep it.",
    "Mama Rose knew me, though, blind as she was.",
    "\u201cWhat color are you, gal?\u201d She asked",
    "and I told her, \u201cI\u2019m as black as last night.\u201d",
    "That's how I passed, without asking permission."

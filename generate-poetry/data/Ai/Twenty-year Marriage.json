    "You keep me waiting in a truck",
    "with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,",
    "while you piss against the south side of a tree.",
    "Hurry. I\u2019ve got nothing on under my skirt tonight.",
    "That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows",
    "and the seat, one fake leather thigh,",
    "pressed close to mine is cold.",
    "I\u2019m the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,",
    "but get inside me, start the engine;",
    "you\u2019ll have the strength, the will to move.",
    "I\u2019ll pull, you push, we\u2019ll tear each other in half.",
    "Come on, baby, lay me down on my back.",
    "Pretend you don\u2019t owe me a thing",
    "and maybe we\u2019ll roll out of here,",
    "leaving the past stacked up behind us;",
    "old newspapers nobody\u2019s ever got to read again."

    "My sister rubs the doll\u2019s face in mud,",
    "then climbs through the truck window.",
    "She ignores me as I walk around it,",
    "hitting the flat tires with an iron rod.",
    "The old man yells for me to help hitch the team,",
    "but I keep walking around the truck, hitting harder,",
    "until my mother calls.",
    "I pick up a rock and throw it at the kitchen window,",
    "but it falls short.",
    "The old man\u2019s voice bounces off the air like a ball",
    "I can\u2019t lift my leg over.",
    "I stand beside him, waiting, but he doesn\u2019t look up",
    "and I squeeze the rod, raise it, his skull splits open.",
    "Mother runs toward us. I stand still,",
    "get her across the spine as she bends over him.",
    "I drop the rod and take the rifle from the house.",
    "Roses are red, violets are blue,",
    "one bullet for the black horse, two for the brown.",
    "They\u2019re down quick. I spit, my tongue\u2019s bloody;",
    "I\u2019ve bitten it. I laugh, remember the one out back.",
    "I catch her climbing from the truck, shoot.",
    "The doll lands on the ground with her.",
    "I pick it up, rock it in my arms.",
    "Yeah. I\u2019m Jack, Hogarth\u2019s son.",
    "I\u2019m nimble, I\u2019m quick.",
    "In the house, I put on the old man\u2019s best suit",
    "and his patent leather shoes.",
    "I pack my mother\u2019s satin nightgown",
    "and my sister\u2019s doll in the suitcase.",
    "Then I go outside and cross the fields to the highway.",
    "I\u2019m fourteen. I\u2019m a wind from nowhere.",
    "I can break your heart."

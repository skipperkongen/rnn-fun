    "Among the signs of autumn I perceive",
    "The Roman wormwood (called by learned men",
    ", food for gods,\u2014",
    "For to impartial science the humblest weed",
    "Is as immortal once as the proudest flower\u2014)",
    "Sprinkles its yellow dust over my shoes",
    "As I cross the now neglected garden.",
    "\u2014We trample under foot the food of gods",
    "And spill their nectar in each drop of dew\u2014",
    "My honest shoes, fast friends that never stray",
    "Far from my couch, thus powdered, countryfied,",
    "Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure,",
    "At the post-house disgrace the Gallic gloss",
    "Of those well dressed ones who no morning dew",
    "Nor Roman wormwood ever have been through,",
    "Who never walk but are",
    "rather\u2014",
    "For what old crime of theirs I do not gather."

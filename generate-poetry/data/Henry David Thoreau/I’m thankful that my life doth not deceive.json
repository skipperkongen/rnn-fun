    "I\u2019m thankful that my life doth not deceive",
    "Itself with a low loftiness, half height,",
    "And think it soars when still it dip its way",
    "Beneath the clouds on noiseless pinion",
    "Like the crow or owl, but it doth know",
    "The full extent of all its trivialness,",
    "Compared with the splendid heights above.",
    "See how it waits to watch the mail come in",
    "While \u2019hind its back the sun goes out perchance.",
    "And yet their lumbering cart brings me no word,",
    "Not one scrawled leaf such as my neighbors get",
    "To cheer them with the slight events forsooth,",
    "Faint ups and downs of their far distant friends\u2014",
    "And now \u2019tis passed. What next? See the long train",
    "Of teams wreathed in dust, their atmosphere;",
    "Shall I attend until the last is passed?",
    "Else why these ears that hear the leader\u2019s bells",
    "Or eyes that link me in procession?",
    "But hark! the drowsy day has done its task,",
    "Far in yon hazy field where stands a barn,",
    "Unanxious hens improve the sultry hour",
    "And with contented voice now brag their deed\u2014",
    "A new laid egg\u2014Now let the day decline\u2014",
    "They\u2019ll lay another by tomorrow\u2019s sun."

    "an ex",
    "one of those long-drawn-out draws so perplexing to Americans.",
    "Nothing riding on the game, two mid-table counties",
    "at the end of a disappointing season, no local rivalry or anything like that,",
    "very few people there, the game itself going nowhere slowly",
    "on its last morning. The deadest of dead rubbers.",
    "Did I say it was raining, and the forecast was for more rain?",
    "Riveting. A way, at best, for the English",
    "to read their newspapers out of doors, and get vaguely shirty",
    "or hot under the collar about something. The paper, maybe, or the rain.",
    "It was like staying to watch your horse lose.",
    "And yet there was some residual sense of good fortune to be there,",
    "perhaps it was the fresh air or being safely out of range of conversation",
    "or the in\ufb01nitesimal prospect of in\ufb01nitesimal entertainment.",
    "One groundsman\u2014the picador\u2014mounted on a tractor,",
    "others on foot, like an army of clowns, with buckets and besoms.",
    "The tractor was towing a rope across the out\ufb01eld to dry it\u2014",
    "we saw the water spray up, almost in slow motion\u2014",
    "as from newly cut hair. The old rope was so endearingly",
    "It approached a pile of sawdust\u2014two failing styles of drying\u2014",
    "and one of the groundsmen put out his foot to casually \ufb02ick it over,",
    "as sporting a gesture as we expected to see all day",
    "in terms of \ufb01nesse, economy of movement, timing.",
    "went up on all sides of the ground. Soft knocks that school a lifetime\u2014no?"

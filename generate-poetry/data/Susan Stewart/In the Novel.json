    "He described her mouth as",
    ".",
    "So when he kissed her finally",
    "he was thinking about ashes",
    "and the blacker rim just below",
    "the edge of the ashtray,",
    "and the faint dark rim that outlined her lips,",
    "and the lips themselves, at the limit",
    "of another darkness, farther",
    "and far more interior.",
    "Then the way the red,",
    "paling, just outside those lines",
    "caught fire and the pages caught",
    "soon after that. Slowly at first,",
    "but then all at once",
    "at the scalloped brown corners of each;",
    "like the ruff of an offended and darkening bird,",
    "extended, then folded",
    "in on itself; multiple,",
    "stiffening, gone."

    "In a drawer I found a map of the world,",
    "folded into eighths and then once again",
    "and each country bore the wrong name because",
    "the map of the world is an orphanage.",
    "The edges of the earth had a margin",
    "as frayed as the hem of the falling night",
    "and a crease moved down toward the center of",
    "the earth, halving the identical stars.",
    "Every river ran with its thin blue",
    "brother out from the heart of a country:",
    "there cedars twisted toward the southern sky",
    "and reeds plumed eastward like an augur\u2019s pens.",
    "No dates on the wrinkles of that broad face,",
    "no slow grinding of mountains and sand, for\u2014",
    "all at once, like a knife on a whetstone\u2014",
    "the map of the world spoke in snakes and tongues.",
    "The hard-topped roads of the western suburbs",
    "and the distant lights of the capitol",
    "each pull away from the yellowed beaches",
    "and step into the lost sea of daybreak.",
    "The map of the world is a canvas turning",
    "away from the painter\u2019s ink-stained hands",
    "while the pigments cake in their little glass",
    "jars and the brushes grow stiff with forgetting.",
    "There is no model, shy and half-undressed,",
    "no open window and flickering lamp,",
    "yet someone has left this sealed blue letter,",
    "this gypsy\u2019s bandana on the darkening",
    "Table, each corner held down by a conch",
    "shell. What does the body remember at",
    "dusk? That the palms of the hands are a map",
    "of the world, erased and drawn again and",
    "Again, then covered with rivers and earth."

    "Everything stops.",
    "A fat man on his way to Baltimore",
    "smokes for three hours in the club car.",
    "The porter slips out and calls his wife,",
    "he has one dime left and he\u2019s almost",
    "yelling. Somewhere south of York,",
    "she thinks he said. The funeral",
    "procession leaves its lights on",
    "and out of this pure stubbornness",
    "its batteries go dead.",
    "The bank robber leans on his horn",
    "in desperation while his partner",
    "snaps the rubber bands around",
    "the money. A band,",
    "you can hear it up the river,",
    "first like the new heart of the child on",
    "your lap, then like an old moon",
    "pulsing below your nails, or something",
    "softly moving through your arms and",
    "throat. Here,",
    "press here, not just drums.",
    "A clown is throwing caramels",
    "at the porch rails, balloons",
    "are exploding or sailing up the river.",
    "The lucky trees, to be able",
    "to stand that close. If we talk",
    "too much, we\u2019ll surely miss it.",
    "And at the still center",
    "of summer it starts; cowboys ride out out",
    "of another life, old cars get up",
    "from the dead and dance",
    "like cripples hired out for a tent meeting.",
    "Up and down the sidewalk, the town",
    "sucks in its breath like a girl",
    "taking short gasps just above her trumpet,",
    "or a fire engine\u2019s horn, heaving",
    "like a drowned man or a heat wave slapping",
    "against the water tower, this afternoon",
    "just like a parade. The sore-footed",
    "ponies are loaded down with flags",
    "and the library float says",
    "\u201cImmortal Shakespeare,\u201d says it",
    "with carnations and the hides of roses,",
    "says it with a jester and a princess",
    "wearing wings.",
    "And she stutters, but no one cares",
    "or can hear her. Except for the man",
    "on the unicycle who tips his top hat",
    "to the crowd, who swears he will",
    "follow her anywhere, who follows",
    "the mayor and the city council, who",
    "follows the tap dancing class and the Future",
    "Farmers, the Lions Club and the Veterans",
    "of Foreign Wars; who clasps a carnation",
    "between his teeth and sways",
    "back and forth like",
    "a broken clock.",
    "And then things begin again,",
    "a car follows the man on the unicycle",
    "and suddenly it\u2019s just another car,",
    "a pair of dice dangling",
    "from the rearview mirror, a woman",
    "giving her breast to a child and another",
    "child carefully peeling a crayon, then",
    "slowly giving the peels to his",
    "grandmother, who opens the big brass",
    "clasps of her pocketbook and lets",
    "the bright curls drop slowly",
    "to the bottom",
    "like confetti or a boy\u2019s first",
    "haircut. Like a first yellow leaf",
    "that fell when we weren\u2019t looking.",
    "Because it\u2019s summer. Like a smooth",
    "yellow pebble that is rubbing and rubbing",
    "in the new left boot of the drummer,",
    "that someone skimmed on the river",
    "exactly at three o\u2019clock.",
    "Not out of anger or of boredom",
    "this time, but as if it could almost",
    "wear wings."

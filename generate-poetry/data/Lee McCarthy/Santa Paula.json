    "There\u2019s a woman kissing a cowboy",
    "across the street. His eight-year-old son",
    "watches from the bus stop bench.",
    "She\u2019s really planting one on him,",
    "his Stetson in danger.",
    "It must have been some weekend.",
    "Seeing no room in that embrace for himself,",
    "the boy measures his future, legs",
    "straight out in front of him.",
    "Both hands hold onto a suitcase handle,",
    "thin arms ready to prove themselves."

    "A boy from Brooklyn used to cruise on summer nights.",
    "As soon as he\u2019d hit sixty he\u2019d hold his hand out the window,",
    "cupping it around the wind. He\u2019d been assured",
    "this is exactly how a woman\u2019s breast feels when you put",
    "your hand around it and apply a little pressure. Now he knew,",
    "and he loved it. Night after night, again and again, until",
    "the weather grew cold and he had to roll the window up.",
    "For many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting",
    "to soar. One winter\u2019s night, holding his wife\u2019s breast",
    "in his hand, he closed his eyes and wanted to weep.",
    "He loved her, but it was the wind he imagined now.",
    "As he grew older, he loved the word etcetera and refused",
    "to abbreviate it. He loved sweet white butter. He often",
    "pretended to be playing the organ. On one of his last mornings,",
    "he noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow.",
    "He shook it out, but the next morning it reappeared."

    "A bride and a groom sitting in an open buggy",
    "in the rain, holding hands but not looking",
    "at each other, waiting for the rain to stop,",
    "waiting for the marriage to begin, embarrassed",
    "by the rain, the effect of the rain on the bridal",
    "veil, the wet horse with his mane in his eyes,",
    "the rain cold as the sea, the sea deep as love,",
    "big drops of rain falling on the leather seat,",
    "the rain beaded on a rose pinned to the groom\u2019s",
    "lapel, the rain on the bride\u2019s bouquet,",
    "on the baby\u2019s breath there, the sound of the rain",
    "hitting the driver\u2019s top hat, the rain",
    "shining like satin on the black street,",
    "on the tips of patent leather shoes, Hokusai\u2019s",
    "father who polished mirrors for a living, Hokusai\u2019s",
    "father watching the sky for clouds, Hokusai\u2019s father\u2019s son",
    "drawing rain over a bridge and over the people crossing",
    "the bridge, Hokusai\u2019s father\u2019s son drawing the rain",
    "for hours, Hokusai\u2019s father rubbing a mirror, the rain",
    "cold as the sea, the sea cold as love, the sea swelling",
    "to a tidal wave, at the tip of the wave white."

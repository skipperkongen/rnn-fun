    "God put his finger on my sacrum",
    "and he lifted me, he set me",
    "in the center of the universe,",
    "the curious desire",
    "of my chronically lonely life.",
    "It was cold and dark and lonely",
    "and I was scared.",
    "There were no accessories.",
    "I burst into tears over nothing.",
    "What would Jimmy Schuyler do?",
    "?",
    "And as quietly as the sound of Kleenex",
    "being pulled from a box,",
    "I sneezed.",
    "And morning, that goddess,",
    "as if she were slightly deaf,",
    "barely lifted her head off the horizon",
    "before laying back down.",
    "And a rose opened her portals",
    "and the scent ran up an elephant\u2019s trunk,",
    "or tried to.",
    "Such a long way for everything to travel!",
    "From here I look like a front moving in",
    "An icy purple light",
    "a poet would say belonged to a perfume stopper",
    "belonging to his mother.",
    "When it was her nipple.",
    "You know, neither in the past",
    "or in the future."

    "What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?",
    "The barbarians are due here today.",
    "Why isn\u2019t anything going on in the senate?",
    "Why are the senators sitting there without legislating?",
    "Because the barbarians are coming today.",
    "What\u2019s the point of senators making laws now?",
    "Once the barbarians are here, they\u2019ll do the legislating.",
    "Why did our emperor get up so early,",
    "and why is he sitting enthroned at the city\u2019s main gate,",
    "in state, wearing the crown?",
    "Because the barbarians are coming today",
    "and the emperor\u2019s waiting to receive their leader.",
    "He\u2019s even got a scroll to give him,",
    "loaded with titles, with imposing names.",
    "Why have our two consuls and praetors come out today",
    "wearing their embroidered, their scarlet togas?",
    "Why have they put on bracelets with so many amethysts,",
    "rings sparkling with magnificent emeralds?",
    "Why are they carrying elegant canes",
    "beautifully worked in silver and gold?",
    "Because the barbarians are coming today",
    "and things like that dazzle the barbarians.",
    "Why don\u2019t our distinguished orators turn up as usual",
    "to make their speeches, say what they have to say?",
    "Because the barbarians are coming today",
    "and they\u2019re bored by rhetoric and public speaking.",
    "Why this sudden bewilderment, this confusion?",
    "(How serious people\u2019s faces have become.)",
    "Why are the streets and squares emptying so rapidly,",
    "everyone going home lost in thought?",
    "Because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come.",
    "And some of our men just in from the border say",
    "there are no barbarians any longer.",
    "Now what\u2019s going to happen to us without barbarians?",
    "Those people were a kind of solution."

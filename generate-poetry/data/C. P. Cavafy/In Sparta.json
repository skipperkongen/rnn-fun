    "He didn\u2019t know, King Kleomenis, he didn\u2019t dare\u2014",
    "he just didn\u2019t know how to tell his mother",
    "a thing like that: Ptolemy\u2019s demand,",
    "to guarantee their treaty, that she too go to Egypt",
    "and be held there as a hostage\u2014",
    "a very humiliating, indecorous thing.",
    "And he would be about to speak yet always hesitate,",
    "would start to tell her yet always stop.",
    "But the magnificent woman understood him",
    "(she\u2019d already heard some rumors about it)",
    "and she encouraged him to get it out.",
    "And she laughed, saying of course she\u2019d go,",
    "happy even that in her old age",
    "she could be useful to Sparta still.",
    "As for the humiliation\u2014that didn\u2019t touch her at all.",
    "Of course an upstart like the Lagid",
    "couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend the Spartan spirit;",
    "so his demand couldn\u2019t in fact humiliate",
    "a Royal Lady like herself:",
    "mother of a Spartan king."

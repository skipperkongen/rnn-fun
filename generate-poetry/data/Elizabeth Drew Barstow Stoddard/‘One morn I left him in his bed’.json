    "One morn I left him in his bed;",

    "\u2018Your child is dying \u2013 he is dead.\u2019",
    "We made him ready for his rest,",
    "Flowers in his hair, and on his breast",
    "His little hands together prest.",
    "We sailed by night across the sea;",
    "So, floating from the world were we,",
    "Apart from sympathy, we Three.",
    "The wild sea moaned, the black clouds spread",
    "Moving shadows on its bed,",
    "But one of us lay midship dead.",
    "I saw his coffin sliding down",
    "The yellow sand in yonder town,",
    "Where I put on my sorrow\u2019s crown.",
    "And we returned; in this drear place",
    "Never to see him face to face,",
    "I thrust aside the living race.",
    "Mothers, who mourn with me today,",
    "Oh, understand me, when I say,",
    "I cannot weep, I cannot pray;",
    "I gaze upon a hidden store,",
    "His books, his toys, the clothes he wore,",
    "And cry, \u2018Once more, to me,",
    "more!\u2019",
    "Then take, from me, this simple verse,",
    "That you may know what I rehearse\u2014",
    "A grief \u2013 your and my Universe!"

    "Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv\u2019ry Tay!",
    "Alas! I am very sorry to say",
    "That ninety lives have been taken away",
    "On the last Sabbath day of 1879,",
    "Which will be remember\u2019d for a very long time.",
    "\u2019Twas about seven o\u2019clock at night,",
    "And the wind it blew with all its might,",
    "And the rain came pouring down,",
    "And the dark clouds seem\u2019d to frown,",
    "And the Demon of the air seem\u2019d to say\u2014",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll blow down the Bridge of Tay.\u201d",
    "When the train left Edinburgh",
    "The passengers\u2019 hearts were light and felt no sorrow,",
    "But Boreas blew a terrific gale,",
    "Which made their hearts for to quail,",
    "And many of the passengers with fear did say\u2014",
    "\u201cI hope God will send us safe across the Bridge of Tay.\u201d",
    "But when the train came near to Wormit Bay,",
    "Boreas he did loud and angry bray,",
    "And shook the central girders of the Bridge of Tay",
    "On the last Sabbath day of 1879,",
    "Which will be remember\u2019d for a very long time.",
    "So the train sped on with all its might,",
    "And Bonnie Dundee soon hove in sight,",
    "And the passengers\u2019 hearts felt light,",
    "Thinking they would enjoy themselves on the New Year,",
    "With their friends at home they lov\u2019d most dear,",
    "And wish them all a happy New Year.",
    "So the train mov\u2019d slowly along the Bridge of Tay,",
    "Until it was about midway,",
    "Then the central girders with a crash gave way,",
    "And down went the train and passengers into the Tay!",
    "The Storm Fiend did loudly bray,",
    "Because ninety lives had been taken away,",
    "On the last Sabbath day of 1879,",
    "Which will be remember\u2019d for a very long time.",
    "As soon as the catastrophe came to be known",
    "The alarm from mouth to mouth was blown,",
    "And the cry rang out all o\u2019er the town,",
    "Good Heavens! the Tay Bridge is blown down,",
    "And a passenger train from Edinburgh,",
    "Which fill\u2019d all the people\u2019 hearts with sorrow,",
    "And made them for to turn pale,",
    "Because none of the passengers were sav\u2019d to tell the tale",
    "How the disaster happen\u2019d on the last Sabbath day of 1879,",
    "Which will be remember\u2019d for a very long time.",
    "It must have been an awful sight,",
    "To witness in the dusky moonlight,",
    "While the Storm Fiend did laugh, and angry did bray,",
    "Along the Railway Bridge of the Silv\u2019ry Tay,",
    "Oh! ill-fated Bridge of the Silv\u2019ry Tay,",
    "I must now conclude my lay",
    "By telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay,",
    "That your central girders would not have given way,",
    "At least many sensible men do say,",
    "Had they been supported on each side with buttresses,",
    "At least many sensible men confesses,",
    "For the stronger we our houses do build,",
    "The less chance we have of being killed."

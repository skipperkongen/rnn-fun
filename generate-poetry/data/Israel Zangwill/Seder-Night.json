    "Prosaic miles of streets stretch all round,",
    "Astir with restless, hurried life and spanned",
    "By arches that with thund\u2019rous trains resound,",
    "And throbbing wires that galvanize the land;",
    "Gin-palaces in tawdry splendor stand;",
    "The newsboys shriek of mangled bodies found;",
    "The last burlesque is playing in the Strand\u2014",
    "In modern prose all poetry seems drowned.",
    "Yet in ten thousand homes this April night",
    "An ancient People celebrates its birth",
    "To Freedom, with a reverential mirth,",
    "With customs quaint and many a hoary rite,",
    "Waiting until, its tarnished glories bright,",
    "Its God shall be the God of all the earth."

    "In Things of moment, on thy self depend,",
    "Nor trust too far thy Servant or thy Friend:",
    "With private Views, thy Friend may promise fair,",
    "And Servants very seldom prove sincere.",
    "What can be done, with Care perform to Day,",
    "Dangers unthought-of will attend Delay;",
    "Your distant Prospects all precarious are,",
    "And Fortune is as fickle as she\u2019s fair.",
    "Nor trivial Loss, nor trivial Gain despise;",
    "Molehills, if often heap\u2019d, to Mountains rise:",
    "Weigh every small Expence, and nothing waste,",
    "Farthings long sav\u2019d, amount to Pounds at last."

    "About me young careless feet",
    "Linger along the garish street;",
    "Above, a hundred shouting signs",
    "Shed down their bright fantastic glow",
    "Upon the merry crowd and lines",
    "Of moving carriages below.",
    "Oh wonderful is Broadway \u0097 only",
    "My heart, my heart is lonely.",
    "Desire naked, linked with Passion,",
    "Goes trutting by in brazen fashion;",
    "From playhouse, cabaret and inn",
    "The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze",
    "All gay without, all glad within;",
    "As in a dream I stand and gaze",
    "At Broadway, shining Broadway \u0097 only",
    "My heart, my heart is lonely."

    "Far down, down through the city\u2019s great gaunt gut",
    "The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;",
    "In the packed cars the fans the crowd\u2019s breath cut,",
    "Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.",
    "And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door",
    "To give their summer jackets to the breeze;",
    "Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar",
    "Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas;",
    "Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift",
    "Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,",
    "Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift",
    "Lightly among the islands of the deep;",
    "Islands of lofy palm trees blooming white",
    "That led their perfume to the tropic sea,",
    "Where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night,",
    "And the Trades float above them fresh and free."

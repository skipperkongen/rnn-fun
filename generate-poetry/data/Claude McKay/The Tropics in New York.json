    "Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root,",
    "Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,",
    "And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit,",
    "Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs,",
    "Set in the window, bringing memories",
    "Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,",
    "And dewy dawns, and mystical blue skies",
    "In benediction over nun-like hills.",
    "My eyes grew dim, and I could no more gaze;",
    "A wave of longing through my body swept,",
    "And, hungry for the old, familiar ways,",
    "I turned aside and bowed my head and wept."

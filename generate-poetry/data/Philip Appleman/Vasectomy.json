    "after the gamble of latex and",
    "diaphragms and pills;",

    "complicity.",
    "And after the precision of scalpels,",

    "the catbird mates for life and",
    "maps trace out no alibis\u2014stepped",
    "into a morning of naked truth,",
    "where acts mean what they really are:",
    "the purity of loving",
    "for the sake of love."

    "In the spring of joy,",
    "when even the mud chuckles,",
    "my soul runs rabid,",
    "snaps at its own bleeding heels,",
    "and barks: \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d",
    "She never saw fire",
    "from heaven or hotly fought",
    "with God; but her eyes",
    "smolder for Hiroshima",
    "and the cold death of Buddha."

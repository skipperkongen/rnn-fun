    "In Indianapolis they drive",
    "five hundred miles and end up",
    "where they started: survival",
    "of the fittest. In the swamps",
    "of Auburn and Elkhart,",
    "in the jungles of South Bend,",
    "one-cylinder chain-driven runabouts fall",
    "to air-cooled V-4\u2019s, a-speed gearboxes,",
    "16-horse flat-twin midships engines\u2014",
    "carcasses left behind",
    "by monobloc motors, electric starters,",
    "3-speed gears, six cylinders, 2-chain drive,",
    "overhead cams, supercharged",
    "to 88 miles an hour in second gear, the age",
    "of Leviathan ...",
    "as endless forms",
    "most beautiful and wonderful",
    "are being evolved.",
    "And then",
    "the drying up, the panic,",
    "the monsters dying: Elcar, Cord,",
    "Auburn, Duesenberg, Stutz\u2014somewhere",
    "out there, the chassis of Studebakers,",
    "Marmons, Lafayettes, Bendixes, all",
    "rusting in high-octane smog,",
    "ashes to ashes, they",
    "end up where they started."

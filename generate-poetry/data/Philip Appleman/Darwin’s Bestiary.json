    "Animals tame and animals feral",
    "prowled the Dark Ages in search of a moral:",
    "the canine was Loyal, the lion was Virile,",
    "rabbits were Potent and gryphons were Sterile.",
    "Sloth, Envy, Gluttony, Pride\u2014every peril",
    "was fleshed into something phantasmic and rural,",
    "while Courage, Devotion, Thrift\u2014every bright laurel",
    "crowned a creature in some mythological mural.",
    "Scientists think there is something immoral",
    "in singular brutes having meat that is plural:",
    "beasts are mere beasts, just as flowers are floral.",
    "Yet between the lines there\u2019s an implicit demurral;",
    "the habit stays with us, albeit it\u2019s puerile:",
    "when Darwin saw squirrels, he saw more than Squirrel.",
    "The ant, Darwin reminded us,",
    "defies all simple-mindedness:",
    "Take nothing (says the ant) on faith,",
    "and never trust a simple truth.",
    "The PR men of bestiaries",
    "eulogized for centuries",
    "this busy little paragon,",
    "nature\u2019s proletarian\u2014",
    "but look here, Darwin said: some ants",
    "make slaves of smaller ants, and end",
    "exploiting in their peonages",
    "the sweating brows of their tiny drudges.",
    "Thus the ant speaks out of both",
    "sides of its mealy little mouth:",
    "its example is extolled",
    "to the workers of the world,",
    "but its habits also preach",
    "the virtues of the idle rich.",
    "Eyeless in Gaza, earless in Britain,",
    "lower than a rattlesnake\u2019s belly-button,",
    "deaf as a judge and dumb as an audit:",
    "nobody gave the worm much credit",
    "till Darwin looked a little closer",
    "at this spaghetti-torsoed loser.",
    "Look, he said, a worm can feel",
    "and taste and touch and learn and smell;",
    "and ounce for ounce, they\u2019re tough as wrestlers,",
    "and love can turn them into hustlers,",
    "and as to work, their labors are mythic,",
    "small devotees of the Protestant Ethic:",
    "they\u2019ll go anywhere, to mountains or grassland,",
    "south to the rain forests, north to Iceland,",
    "fifty thousand to every acre",
    "guzzling earth like a drunk on liquor,",
    "churning the soil and making it fertile,",
    "earning the thanks of every mortal:",
    "proud",
    "with legs and arms\u2014",
    "his whole existence depends on worms.",
    "So, History, no longer let",
    "the worm\u2019s be an ignoble lot",
    "unwept, unhonored, and unsung.",
    "Moral: even a worm can turn.",
    "a. Except in distress, the rabbit is silent,",
    "but social as teacups: no hare is an island.",
    "(Moral:",
    "silence is golden\u2014or anyway harmless;",
    "rabbits may run, but never for Congress.)",
    "b. When a rabbit gets miffed, he bounds in an orbit,",
    "kicking and scratching like\u2014well, like a rabbit.",
    "(Moral:",
    "to thine own self be true\u2014or as true as you can;",
    "a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing fleeces his skin.)",
    "c. He populates prairies and mountains and moors,",
    "but in Sweden the rabbit can\u2019t live out of doors.",
    "(Moral:",
    "to know your own strength, take a tug at your shackles;",
    "to understand purity, ponder your freckles.)",
    "d. Survival developed these small furry tutors;",
    "the morals of rabbits outnumber their litters.",
    "(Conclusion:",
    "you needn\u2019t be brainy, benign, or bizarre",
    "to be thought a great prophet. Endure. Just endure.)",
    "Sixty miles from land the gentle trades",
    "that silk the Yankee clippers to Cathay",
    "sift a million gossamers, like tides",
    "of fluff above the menace of the sea.",
    "These tiny spiders spin their bits of webbing",
    "and ride the air as schooners ride the ocean;",
    "the",
    "trapped a thousand in its rigging,",
    "small aeronauts on some elusive mission.",
    "The Megatherium, done to extinction",
    "by its own bigness, makes a counterpoint",
    "to gossamers, who breathe us this small lesson:",
    "for survival, it\u2019s the little things that count."

    "Lying in bed and waiting to find out",
    "Whatever is going to happen: the window shade",
    "Making its slightest sound as the night wind,",
    "Outside, in the night, breathes quietly on it;",
    "It is parental hovering over the infantile;",
    "Something like that; it is like being a baby,",
    "And over the sleep of the baby there is a father,",
    "Or mother, breathing, hovering; the streetlight light",
    "In the nighttime branches breathing quietly too;",
    "Altering; realtering; it is the body breathing;",
    "The crib of knowing: something about what the day",
    "Will bring; and something about what the night will hold,",
    "Safely, at least for the rest of the night, I pray."

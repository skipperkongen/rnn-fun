    "Saturday afternoon. The barracks is almost empty.",
    "The soldiers are almost all on overnight pass.",
    "There is only me, writing this letter to you,",
    "And one other soldier, down at the end of the room,",
    "And a spider, that hangs by the thread of his guts,",
    "His tenacious and delicate guts, Swift\u2019s spider,",
    "All self-regard, or else all privacy.",
    "The dust drifts in the sunlight around him, as currents",
    "Lie in lazy, drifting schools in the vast sea.",
    "In his little sea the spider lowers himself",
    "Out of his depth. He is his own diving bell,",
    "Though he cannot see well. He observes no fish,",
    "And sees no wonderful things. His unseeing guts",
    "Are his only hold on the world outside himself.",
    "I love you, and miss you, and I find you hard to imagine.",
    "Down at the end of the room, the other soldier",
    "Is getting ready, I guess, to go out on pass.",
    "He is shining his boots. He sits on the edge of his bunk,",
    "Private, submissive, and heedful of himself,",
    "And, bending over himself, he is his own nest.",
    "The slightest sound he makes is of his being.",
    "He is his mother, and nest, wife, brother, and father.",
    "His boots are bright already, yet still he rubs",
    "And rubs till, brighter still, they are his mirror,",
    "And in this mirror he observes, I guess,",
    "His own submissiveness. He is far from home."

    "I sit here in a shelter behind the words",
    "Of what I\u2019m writing, looking out as if",
    "Through a dim curtain of rain, that keeps me in here.",
    "The words are like a scrim upon a page,",
    "Obscuring what might be there beyond the scrim.",
    "I can dimly see there\u2019s something or someone there.",
    "But I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s God, or one of his angels,",
    "Or the past, or future, or who it is I love,",
    "My mother or father lost, or my lost sister,",
    "Or my wife lost when I was too late to get there,",
    "I only know that there\u2019s something, or somebody, there.",
    "Tell me your name. How was it that I knew you?"

    "I find I am descending in a propeller plane upon Pasco",
    "in the state of Washington. I accept this;",
    "I have reasons for participating in the experiential sequence",
    "that has brought me here. Down below the land is printed",
    "with huge circles, doubtless an irrigation system,",
    "doubtless it makes sense. There are people who understand it",
    "living with dignity in square houses",
    "and the result possibly is one billion radishes.",
    "Now some so-called time has passed. This nation",
    "is a huge nation in which the infinity of for example",
    "Washington State",
    "is just one segment of an even less thinkable hugeness",
    "and yet",
    "United Airlines has me",
    "here in my Eastern metropolis",
    "with its ten thousand makers of third-rate pizza",
    "uncannily far from the possible radishes of Washington State.",

    "reading a few poems by David Rivard. I have thoughts.",
    "I have my Uncle Ralph\u2019s jacket soft and droopy giving me",
    "a Sense of the Past. The rain out there",
    "on the roofs of retail outlets is saying No Guarantee",
    "and in a way I am nowhere, in another way maybe",
    "definitely not. In a wide wet parking lot",
    "I turn back toward the store to explain to the cashier",
    "that she charged me for six cans of seltzer when in fact",
    "I only had one",
    "a six-pack",
    "but the idea of justice seems so fatiguing",
    "I would rather read a surprisingly serious detective novel",
    "so I vibrate with indecision in the parking lot",
    "till all the car windows rattle imperceptibly. Then",
    "an alleged interval ostensibly intervenes, at the mall",
    "a woman at a piano has played 1800 songs from memory",
    "according to the radio personality who stands with a mike",
    "explaining her bid for the Guinness Book of Records.",
    "I am walking away at an unplanned angle singing \u201cTiny Montgomery\u201d",

    "I have this inner life, I think of my father",
    "lonely in Vermont, I think of myself lonely in Syracuse",
    "and my old poem about a detective who can\u2019t solve his biggest case",
    "and as a result I have feelings\u2014but my teacher said",
    "the future of American poetry can\u2019t be merely",
    "the notation of sensibility. When he said that I felt",
    "a chilly fear at the edge of consc-consc-consc-consciousness",
    "like an ice cube in the corner of my stomach.",
    "That\u2019s how I felt. So then, so then consequently",
    "I thought \u201cI must gather up some serious ideas\u201d but then",
    "Ashberry phoned and left a message after the beep.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t be a sucker, ideas are where it",
    ".\u201d",
    "This made my throat get sort of dry so I drank a Classic Coke",
    "and then another Classic Coke two hours later",
    "as time so-to-say passed. What was always there?",

    "when I pick up my color prints at the camera shop",
    "the disappointment I always feel is actually a blessing",
    "is it not? I can say \u201cI\u2019ll go along with this charade",

    "dogs, balloons, air conditioners, hats, clocks, and noses.",
    "To him I convey that the world is okay:",
    "life is good: we accept it. Your dad is a little mixed up",
    "but your shoes got tied, right?",
    "As Barbara Cohen in high school said about politics",
    "it\u2019s interesting, giving the word four earnest syllables,",
    "in-ter-est-ing."

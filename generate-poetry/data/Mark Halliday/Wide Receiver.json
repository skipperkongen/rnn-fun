    "In the huddle you said \u201cGo long\u2014get open\u201d",
    "and at the snap I took off along the right sideline",
    "and then cut across left in a long arc",
    "and I\u2019m sure I was open at several points\u2014",
    "glancing back I saw you pump-fake more than once",
    "but you must not have been satisfied with what you saw downfield",
    "and then I got bumped off course and my hands touched the turf",
    "but I regained my balance and dashed back to the right",
    "I think or maybe first left and then right",
    "and I definitely got open but the throw never came\u2014",
    "maybe you thought I couldn\u2019t hang on to a ball flung so far",
    "or maybe you actually can\u2019t throw so far",
    "but in any case I feel quite open now,",
    "the defenders don\u2019t seem too interested in me",
    "I sense only open air all around me",
    "though the air is getting darker and it would appear",
    "by now we\u2019re well into the fourth quarter",
    "and I strongly doubt we can afford to settle for",
    "dinky little first downs if the score is what I think it is",
    "so come on, star boy, fling a Hail Mary",
    "with a dream-coached combination of muscle and faith",
    "and I will gauge the arc and I will not be stupidly frantic",
    "and I will time my jump and\u2014I\u2019m just going to say",
    "in the cool gloaming of this weirdly long game",
    "it is not impossible that I will make the catch."

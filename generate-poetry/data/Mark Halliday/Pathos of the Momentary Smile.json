    "Like nearly all women under sixty she would have deftly",
    "avoided meeting the eyes of an unknown man\u2014",
    "but occasionally an exception happens by chance",
    "and her unconscious skill at avoidance gets instantly",
    "replaced by a human generosity which is either",
    "inherently feminine or gender-trained, as you please;",
    "she glanced at me exactly when I glanced at her",
    "in the store at the mall and so she gave me",
    "that momentary slight smile which implies",
    "to suggest the slightest likelihood that you and I will",
    "meet or talk, much less make love and",
    "much less together conceive a sweet helpless child,",
    "still our eyes have just met and in this there is",
    "an undeniable contact between your humanity and mine",
    "and you are probably coping with some difficulties",
    "of masculine humanity while I cope with those",
    "of feminine humanity; and so I wish you well.",
    "Her smile said this",
    "but I did not smile back because\u2014",
    "because guys don\u2019t do that\u2014because",
    "we are strong and separate and firm and without softness!",
    "So then the next moment had come and we had walked apart",
    "in our two differently inflected kinds of routine loneliness."

    "The guys who drank quarts of Busch last night",
    "here by the backstop of this baseball diamond",
    "had names given them by their mothers and fathers\u2014",
    "\u201cJack\u201d and \u201cKenny\u201d let us say.",
    "Jack might be",
    "a skinny guy in a black fake-leather jacket,",
    "he\u2019s twenty-five, his gray pants are too loose on his hips,",
    "his jaws always have these little black extra hairs,",
    "his mother won\u2019t talk to him on the phone,",
    "she lives on french fries and ketchup,",
    "he hasn\u2019t been able to send her any cash",
    "in the last two years, ever since he lost",
    "his job unloading produce trucks at Pathmark;",
    "Jack\u2019s father disappeared when he was ten.",
    "\u201cNo big deal,\u201d Jack says, \u201che was a bastard anyway,",
    "he used to flatten beer cans on the top of my head.\u201d",
    "Kenny offers a laugh-noise. He\u2019s heard all that before.",
    "Kenny is forty-eight, a flabby man with reddened skin,",
    "he is employed at the Italian Market selling fish",
    "just four hours a day but his shirts hold the smell;",
    "his female companion Deena left him a note last month:",
    "\u201cYou owe me $12 chocolate $31 wine $55 cable TV plus",
    "donuts\u2014I have had it\u2014taking lamp and mirror",
    "they are mine.\u201d Kenny hasn\u2019t seen her since.",
    "He hangs with Jack because Jack talks loud",
    "as if the world of cops and people with full-time jobs",
    "could be kept at bay by talking, talking loud . . .",
    "(I\u2019m talking gently and",
    "here",
    "as if the world of bums and jerks could be kept far off\u2014)",
    "Jack and Kenny. (Or two other guys dark to me with wounds",
    "oozing in Philadelphia ways less ready to narrate.)",
    "Last night at midnight they got cheesesteaks at Casseloni\u2019s",
    "and bought four quarts at the Fireside Tavern",
    "and wandered into this park. After one quart of Busch",
    "Jack said he was Lenny Dykstra",
    "and found a stick for his bat. \u201cPitch to me asshole\u201d he said",
    "so Kenny went to the mound and pitched his bottle",
    "for want of anything better and Jack swung in the dark and missed;",
    "Kenny\u2019s bottle smashed on home plate and Jack heard in the sound",
    "the absurdity of all his desiring since seventh grade,",
    "absurdity of a skinny guy who blew everything since seventh",
    "when he hit home runs and chased Joan Rundle around the gym",
    "so Jack took his own empty bottle and smashed it down",
    "amid the brown shards of Kenny\u2019s bottle.",
    "Then they leaned on the backstop to drink the other two quarts",
    "and they both grew glum and silent",
    "and when they smashed these bottles it was like",
    "what else would they do? Next morning",
    "Nick and I come to the park with a rubber ball",
    "and a miniature bat. Nick is not quite three",
    "but he knows the names of all the Phillies starters",
    "and he knows the area around home plate is not supposed to be",
    "covered with jagged pieces of brown glass. Like a good dad",
    "I warn him not to touch it and we decide to establish",
    "a new home plate closer to the mound (there\u2019s no trash can",
    "handy). \u201cWho put that glass there?\u201d Nick wants to know",
    "and to make a long story short I say \u201cBad People.\u201d",
    "Nick says \u201cBad? How come?\u201d"

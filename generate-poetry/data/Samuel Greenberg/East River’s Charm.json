    "Is this the river East I heard?\u2014",
    "Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred",
    "And the reaching wharves from the inner land",
    "Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand\u2014",
    "And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud",
    "Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed",
    "From the rays of the morning sun",
    "Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.",
    "But look at the depth of the drippling tide",
    "The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;",
    "As the boat turns upon the silvery spread",
    "It leaves\u2014strange\u2014a shadow dead.",
    "And the very charms from the reflective river",
    "And from the stacks of the floating boat\u2014",
    "There seemeth the quality ne\u2019er to dissever",
    "Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke."

    "The motion of gathering loops of water",
    "Must either burst or remain in a moment.",
    "The violet colors through the glass",
    "Throw up little swellings that appear",
    "And spatter as soon as another strikes",
    "And is born; so pure are they of colored",
    "Hues, that we feel the absent strength",
    "Of its power. When they begin they gather",
    "Like sand on the beach: each bubble",
    "Contains a complete eye of water."

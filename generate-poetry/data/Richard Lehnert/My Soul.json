    "any other age would be a road roughed",
    "halfway through some dark wood\u2019s listening heart",
    "two damp young men in suits sucked dry of light",
    "walk stiffly and uncertain round a bend",
    "in each left hand the black box of a book",
    "They see me then spread out to fill the way",
    "as sun blares down and dry May wind slaps",
    "cheap loose plastic cloth against their shins",
    "The thinner taller blond one greets me in",
    "an earnest tone these days not often heard",
    "and when I do not take his offered hand",
    "surprised he pulls it back by jerked degrees",
    "says",
    "We\u2019d like to talk with you about",
    "Then without my willing it this left palm",
    "rises as if to let them read what life",
    "has written there and with eyes as steady",
    "as I always hoped they were I meet the",
    "blue and shaking gaze of this elder who",
    "is younger than my unborn son\u2019s first son",
    "and without warmth or cold not harsh or kind",
    "say",
    "These boys awkward in cloth and flesh of men",
    "stammer in relief their soft farewells",
    "and what I would not let them save or name",
    "stands long in silence looking after them"

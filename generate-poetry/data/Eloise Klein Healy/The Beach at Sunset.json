    "The cliff above where we stand is crumbling",
    "and up on the Palisades",
    "the sidewalks buckle like a broken conveyer belt.",
    "Art Deco palm trees sway their hula skirts",
    "in perfect unison",
    "against a backdrop of gorgeous blue,",
    "and for you I would try it,",
    "though I have always forbidden myself to write",
    "poems about the beach at sunset.",
    "All the clich\u00e9s for it sputter",
    "like the first generation of neon,",
    "and what attracts me anyway",
    "are these four species of gulls we\u2019ve identified,",
    "their bodies turned into the wind,",
    "and not one of them aware of their silly beauty.",
    "I\u2019m the one awash in pastels",
    "and hoping to salvage the day, finally turning away",
    "from the last light on the western shore",
    "and the steady whoosh of waves driving in,",
    "drumming insistently like the undeniable data",
    "of the cancer in your breast.",
    "We walk back to the car",
    "and take the top down for the ride home",
    "through the early mist.",
    "No matter what else is happening,",
    "this is California. You\u2019ll have your cancer",
    "at freeway speeds. I\u2019ll drive and park",
    "and drive at park. The hospital",
    "when I arrive to visit will be catching",
    "the last rays of the sun, glinting",
    "like an architectural miracle realized.",
    "I realize a miracle is what you need\u2014",
    "a grain of sand, a perfect world",
    "where you live beyond the facts",
    "of what your body has given you",
    "as the first taste of death."

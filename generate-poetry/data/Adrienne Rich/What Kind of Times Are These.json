    "There's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill",
    "and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows",
    "near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted",
    "who disappeared into those shadows.",
    "I've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled",
    "this isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here,",
    "our country moving closer to its own truth and dread,",
    "its own ways of making people disappear.",
    "I won't tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods",
    "meeting the unmarked strip of light\u2014",
    "ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise:",
    "I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear.",
    "And I won't tell you where it is, so why do I tell you",
    "anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these",
    "to have you listen at all, it's necessary",
    "to talk about trees."

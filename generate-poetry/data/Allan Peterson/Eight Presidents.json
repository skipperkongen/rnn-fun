    "October five. Seven years older in dog years and then your November",
    "the day record snowfalls hit Randolph New Hampshire in forty-three",
    "and I am thinking of something intimate and impossible to waste:",
    "Brazil\u2019s undiscovered caverns of amethyst endless smooth oval stones",
    "along Washington\u2019s moody Pacific chewing a continent. But I am wrong.",
    "We pass St. Michael\u2019s the cemetery that asks the public to mow and weed it",
    "and perhaps draw larger conclusions about the already wasted and tidy up names",
    "frayed at the edges by the ions that bind by age the chemical salt of time",
    "that jostles stones over at their bases to remind us or alter their sentiments.",
    "We read and read and each time nothing new has come up on their markers.",
    "At home we hear the fishermen bring up their nets smack water to scare them.",
    "By now the flounder\u2019s secret pocket where its heart and everything separate",
    "from meat and bone is cleaned and empty as a silk purse not a nickel left",
    "down in the freezer. Nothing really shines but this: I have loved you",
    "eight presidents. Forty years. Five point seven in dog."

    "I was so worried the hickory I recognized",
    "had died from salt burn in the last hurricane",
    "I may have passed by vervain and apple haw",
    "like they didn\u2019t matter, but this spring",
    "it put out seven shoots from its base.",
    "Still, the oldest trick is the moon missing,",
    "then the \u201cnew\u201d moon appears,",
    "though we know it\u2019s the old one, and we pretend",
    "to be taken in like the mother or baby",
    "behind the bath towel.",
    "Really it\u2019s the moon winking,",
    "being the stone that holds stones and now footprints.",
    "And when I tell Frances, I see",
    "is a moon",
    "motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting",
    "a lamp, a face that awakens on paper."

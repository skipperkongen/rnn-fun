    "To have that letter arrive",
    "was like the mist that took a meadow",
    "and revealed hundreds",
    "of small webs once invisible",
    "The inevitable often",
    "stands by plainly but unnoticed",
    "till it hands you a letter",
    "that says death and you notice",
    "the weed field had been",
    "readying its many damp handkerchiefs",
    "all along"

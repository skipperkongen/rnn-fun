    "many a memory of regret and loneliness and whose misery",
    "I now understand came less from my pocked nature than from",
    "the chokehold of blue laws, and from my broken-willed Eeyore",
    "of a used car which liked to stop stubbornly in Sealy, halfway to",
    "Hill Country, and always one day after the insurance ran out,",
    "and from the paucity of public space so that we drove (locally)",
    "from shopping strip to balding park, once to a leech-infested pond;",
    "and owing also to the blinding afternoons that made invisible,",
    "beauty; together with the impossibility of finding deep",
    "shade or hearing wind flash through trees, the abundance of short",
    "starting out to break down in Sealy without borrowing again",
    "furthering the shallow sense of experience; and all this witnessed",

    "of desperation-and-relief I have been lucky enough not to feel since,",
    "a collective village slamming the doors on our town, plugging in",
    "or the thwapping mullets jumping out of it, and we might as well be"

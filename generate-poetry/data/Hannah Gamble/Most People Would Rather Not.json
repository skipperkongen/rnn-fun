    "Most people would rather not,",

    "the thought of it. Sometimes",
    "the oily smell of an evening flower appears",
    "and hangs in the air, a slightly browner spot.",

    "of grass to lie down in.",
    "There are prayers, though,",
    "about that kind of peace.",
    "I have to admit, sometimes",
    "I want nothing more than to be lying on the bottom",
    "of an unimpressive river.",
    "I can watch all the leaves and sticks skim over my head,",
    "and no one will bother me",
    "because they\u2019re swimming",
    "in the more impressive rivers.",

    "or fetal.",
    "I came to the humble water to lie down.",
    "I did what I set out to do.",
    "Now I don\u2019t have to tell you",
    "anything more about it."

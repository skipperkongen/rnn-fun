    "My house disgusted me, so I slept in a tent.",

    "as the inclusiveness of all activities: I walked out into the yard,",
    "trying to vomit and drink milk simultaneously. I tried to sleep",
    "while smoking a cigar. I have enough regrets to crack all the plumbing.",
    "I\u2019m whole only in that I\u2019ve built my person from every thought I\u2019ve ever loved."

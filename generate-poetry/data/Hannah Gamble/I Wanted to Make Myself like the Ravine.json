    "I wanted to make myself like the ravine",
    "so that all good things",
    "would flow into me.",
    "Because the ravine is lowly,",
    "it receives an abundance.",
    "This sounds wonderful",
    "to everyone",
    "who suffers from lacking,",
    "but consider, too, that a ravine",
    "keeps nothing out:",
    "in flows a peach",
    "with only one bite taken out of it,",
    "but in flows, too,",
    "the body of a stiff mouse",
    "half cooked by the heat of the stove",
    "it was toughening under.",
    "I have an easygoing way about me.",
    "I\u2019ve been an inviting host \u2014",
    "meaning to, not meaning to.",
    "Oops \u2014 he\u2019s approaching with his tongue",
    "already out",
    "and moving.",
    "Analyze the risks",
    "of becoming a ravine.",
    "Compare those with the risks",
    "of becoming a well",
    "with a well-bolted lid.",
    "Which I\u2019d prefer",
    "depends largely on which kinds",
    "of animals were inside me",
    "when the lid went on",
    "and how likely they\u2019d be",
    "to enjoy the water,",
    "vs. drown, freeze, or starve.",
    "The lesson: close yourself off",
    "at exactly the right time.",
    "On the day that you wake up",
    "under some yellow curtains",
    "with a smile on your face,",
    "lock the door.",
    "Live out your days",
    "untroubled like that."

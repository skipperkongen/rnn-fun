    "A woman stepped outside, crumbled",
    "into a loose particulate, and, as the breeze",
    "blew up from the east, she scattered: her handful",
    "of heart, volcanic ash, spiraled the highway,",
    "and five of her teeth slipped between",
    "her neighbor's breasts; her neighbor",
    "unbuttoned her blouse to scratch",
    "at her suddenly red and luminous skin.",
    "Days passed. Each day the sun distractedly",
    "drifted from chair to chair; each night the stars,",
    "old scatterbrains, they commiserated.",
    "It didn't rain.",
    ", the granular woman",
    "thought to herself:",
    ".",
    "Her car sparkled with her hair and bones;",
    "her garden thrived. She tried to think:",
    "\u2014those old hours,",
    "spotted and exotic lizards, darted",
    "the gravel, flicking through their colors",
    "of skin as one flicks channels on a tv.",
    "She couldn't catch a one. Then, as a flock",
    "of sparrows converging for the skull",
    "of an oak, all her twittering dust,",
    "her brain, bone, and the dangerous shreds",
    "of her fingers clawed for the sky;",
    "someone said."

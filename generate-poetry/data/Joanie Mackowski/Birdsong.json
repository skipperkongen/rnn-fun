    "Bustle and caw. Recall the green heat",
    "rising from the new minted earth, granite",
    "and basalt, proto-continents shuffling",
    "and stacking the deck, first shadows flung",
    "from the ultraviolet haze. A fern",
    "uncurls from the swamp, the microscopic furnace",
    "of replication warms the world, one",
    "becoming two, two four: exponential blossom.",

    "escaping into the sky\u2014then the dumbstruck",
    "hour, unmoored by a river,",
    "a first fish creeps to the land to marvel",
    "at the monstrous buds of its toes. And stars",
    "grow feet and walk across the years, into these dozing,",
    "ordinary days, climbing the spine\u2019s winding",
    "stair, where crickets yawn and history spins."

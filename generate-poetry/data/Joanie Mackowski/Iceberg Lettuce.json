    "What vegetable leviathan",
    "extends beneath the dinner table,",
    "an unseen, monstrous green that pulls",
    "the chair out from under our faith",
    "in appearances: see a mere tuft",
    "of leaf on the plate like a wing,",
    "but if it flies away, it undoubtedly",
    "will disturb the continental drift",
    "asleep under the salad plate,",
    "the hidden world we forget",
    "as we reach for the smaller fork\u0097",
    "(and now, mouth full, don't speak: politely",
    "chew your leaf of firmament",
    "that's torn and tossed up in vinegar here as",
    "we'll be tossed before its vast",
    "root maybe someday or any moment)."

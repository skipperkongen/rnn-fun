    "How it is fickle, leaving one alone to wander",
    "the halls of the skull with the fluorescents",
    "softly flickering. It rests on the head",
    "like a bird nest, woven of twigs and tinsel",
    "and awkward as soon as one stops to look.",
    "That pile of fallen leaves drifting from",
    "the brain to the fingertip burned on the stove,",
    "to the grooves in that man\u2019s voice",
    "as he coos to his dog, blowing into the leaves",
    "of books with moonlit opossums",
    "and Chevrolets easing down the roads",
    "of one\u2019s bones. And now it plucks a single",
    "tulip from the pixelated blizzard: yet",
    "itself is a swarm, a pulse with no",
    "indigenous form, the brain\u2019s lunar halo.",
    "Our compacted galaxy, its constellations",
    "trembling like flies caught in a spider web,",
    "until we die, and then the flies",
    "buzz away\u2014while another accidental",
    "coherence counts to three to pass the time",
    "or notes the berries on the bittersweet vine",
    "strewn in the spruces, red pebbles dropped",
    "in the brain\u2019s gray pool. How it folds itself",
    "like a map to fit in a pocket, how it unfolds",
    "a fraying map from the pocket of the day."

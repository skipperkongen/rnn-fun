    "Such as there was in the littleness of that dawn",
    "could not be this. Not, certainly, the hove",
    "of an invasion fleet from Angleterre,",
    "flotilla wrought of shipwright, chandler, armorer",
    "as if Ice Age breeding stocks were on the move.",
    "haruspices their entrails. All divined",
    "the red planet aligned, full-moon",
    "visibility, high tides to clear",
    "the beachhead obstacles \u2014 but iffy weather.",
    "Gulls glean the wakes. Something of a factory \u2014",
    "diesel and air and the Jersey spirit spark \u2014",
    "of the hydrocarbon",
    "makes",
    "ungainly way in the valleys of the swells.",
    "The shore emerges quaquaversally.",
    "A Very pistol throats the air. Battlewagons",
    "wheel for the presentation of the agon.",
    "Shades of sherry fill the clouds with light.",
    "Mike boats enter surf\u2019s unscrolling rolls.",
    "Empty jaws agape, the gods take note.",
    "they start saliva flowing, must be painful",
    "for the gods: not preamble for the meal,",
    "the meal itself. Famished",
    "Amphibious landings to prevail require",
    "the triumph of the small; circle in circle",
    "perfected on parade grounds of the soul.",
    "Committing an empire to the fire",
    "calls for just-in-time ferocity.",
    "They eat the savage honey. The boys pound sand.",
    "Green eyes gammoning they all pound sand",
    "until for the battle there was nothing left that day",
    "but what the carrion patrols collect",
    "for Paternosterers to sacristy.",
    "Just the one wild tone working alone",
    "the registers, trying the proper sound",
    "for sorrow. Ours for theirs,",
    "theirs for theirs, ours for ours.",
    "So many shouldering forward, enjambed",
    "now cross the Styx with the ease of smoke",
    "passing through a window screen ... depart",
    "the shapes of things continuing for shapes",
    "supercooled to the stillness of mortmain.",
    "The business of the flag is never done.",
    "It fills in the wind and fails, but never the same",
    "akimbo twice. Each snap a fresh report",
    "from acres of tended lawn",
    "rankled by crosses perfectly plumb."

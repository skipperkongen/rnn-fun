    "An old man going a lone highway,",
    "Came, at the evening cold and gray,",
    "To a chasm vast and deep and wide.",
    "Through which was flowing a sullen tide",
    "The old man crossed in the twilight dim,",
    "The sullen stream had no fear for him;",
    "But he turned when safe on the other side",
    "And built a bridge to span the tide.",
    "\u201cOld man,\u201d said a fellow pilgrim near,",
    "\u201cYou are wasting your strength with building here;",
    "Your journey will end with the ending day,",
    "You never again will pass this way;",
    "You\u2019ve crossed the chasm, deep and wide,",
    "Why build this bridge at evening tide?\u201d",
    "The builder lifted his old gray head;",
    "\u201cGood friend, in the path I have come,\u201d he said,",
    "\u201cThere followed after me to-day",
    "A youth whose feet must pass this way.",
    "This chasm that has been as naught to me",
    "To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be;",
    "He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;",
    "Good friend, I am building this bridge for him!\u201d"

    "It was Christmastime,",
    "the balloons needed blowing,",
    "and so in the evening",
    "we sat together to blow",
    "balloons and tell jokes,",
    "and the cool air off the hills",
    "made me think of coffee,",
    "so I said, \u201cCoffee would be nice,\u201d",
    "and he said, \u201cYes, coffee",
    "would be nice,\u201d and smiled",
    "as his thin fingers pulled",
    "the balloons from the plastic bags;",
    "so I went for coffee,",
    "and it takes a few minutes",
    "to make the coffee",
    "and I did not know",
    "if he wanted cow\u2019s milk",
    "or condensed milk,",
    "and when I came out",
    "to ask him, he was gone,",
    "just like that, in the time",
    "it took me to think,",
    "cow\u2019s milk or condensed;",
    "the balloons sat lightly",
    "on his still lap."

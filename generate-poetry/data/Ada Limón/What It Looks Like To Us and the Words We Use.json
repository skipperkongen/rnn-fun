    "All these great barns out here in the outskirts,",
    "black creosote boards knee-deep in the bluegrass.",
    "They look so beautifully abandoned, even in use.",
    "You say they look like arks after the sea\u2019s",
    "dried up, I say they look like pirate ships,",
    "and I think of that walk in the valley where",
    "J said, You don\u2019t believe in God? And I said,",
    "No. I believe in this connection we all have",
    "to nature, to each other, to the universe.",
    "And she said, Yeah, God. And how we stood there,",
    "low beasts among the white oaks, Spanish moss,",
    "and spider webs, obsidian shards stuck in our pockets,",
    "woodpecker flurry, and I refused to call it so.",
    "So instead, we looked up at the unruly sky,",
    "its clouds in simple animal shapes we could name",
    "though we knew they were really just clouds\u2014",
    "disorderly, and marvelous, and ours."

    "It was a flower once, it was one of a billion flowers",
    "whose perfume broke through closed car windows,",
    "forced a blessing on their drivers.",

    "grew juice instead of tears, and small hard sour seeds,",

    "branch; ripeness can\u2019t stop itself, breathes out;",
    "we can\u2019t stop it either. We breathe in."

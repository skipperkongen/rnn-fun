    "The farm boys, asleep in their beds,",
    "live the same wildness under their lids;",
    "every morning they come back",
    "through the whites of their eyes",
    "to do their chores, their hands pausing",
    "to pet the dog, to press",
    "its ears back, over the skull,",
    "to quiet that other world."

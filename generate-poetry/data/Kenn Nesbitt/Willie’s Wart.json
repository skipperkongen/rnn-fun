    "Willie had a stubborn wart",
    "upon his middle toe.",
    "Regardless, though, of what he tried",
    "the wart refused to go.",
    "So Willie went and visited",
    "his family foot physician,",
    "who instantly agreed",
    "it was a stubborn wart condition.",
    "The doctor tried to squeeze the wart.",
    "He tried to twist and turn it.",
    "He tried to scrape and shave the wart.",
    "He tried to boil and burn it.",
    "He poked it with a pair of tongs.",
    "He pulled it with his tweezers.",
    "He held it under heat lamps,",
    "and he crammed it into freezers.",
    "Regrettably these treatments",
    "were of very little use.",
    "He looked at it and sputtered,",
    "\u201cAch! I cannot get it loose!\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll have to get some bigger tools",
    "to help me to dissect it.",
    "I\u2019ll need to pound and pummel it,",
    "bombard it and inject it.\u201d",
    "He whacked it with a hammer,",
    "and he yanked it with a wrench.",
    "He seared it with a welding torch",
    "despite the nasty stench.",
    "He drilled it with a power drill.",
    "He wrestled it with pliers.",
    "He zapped it with a million volts",
    "from large electric wires.",
    "He blasted it with gamma rays,",
    "besieged it with corrosives,",
    "assaulted it with dynamite",
    "and nuclear explosives.",
    "He hit the wart with everything,",
    "but when the smoke had cleared,",
    "poor Willie\u2019s stubborn wart remained,",
    "and Willie\u2019d disappeared."

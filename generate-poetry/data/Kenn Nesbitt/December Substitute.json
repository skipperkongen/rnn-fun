    "Our substitute is strange because",
    "he looks a lot like Santa Claus.",
    "In fact, the moment he walked in",
    "we thought that he was Santa\u2019s twin.",
    "We wouldn\u2019t think it quite so weird,",
    "if it were just his snowy beard.",
    "But also he has big black boots",
    "and wears these fuzzy bright red suits.",
    "He\u2019s got a rather rounded gut",
    "that\u2019s like a bowl of you-know-what.",
    "And when he laughs, it\u2019s deep and low",
    "and sounds a lot like \u201cHo! Ho! Ho!\u201d",
    "He asks us all if we\u2019ve been good",
    "and sleeping when we know we should.",
    "He talks of reindeers, sleighs, and elves",
    "and tells us to behave ourselves.",
    "And when it\u2019s time for us to go",
    "he dashes out into the snow.",
    "But yesterday we figured out",
    "just what our sub is all about.",
    "We know just why he leaves so quick,",
    "and why he\u2019s dressed like Old Saint Nick",
    "in hat and coat and boots and all:",
    "He\u2019s working evenings at the mall."

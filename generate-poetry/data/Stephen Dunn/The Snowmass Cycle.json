    "The sailor dreamt of loss,",
    "but it was I who dreamt the sailor.",
    "I was landlocked, sea-poor.",
    "The sailor dreamt of a woman",
    "who stared at the sea, then tired",
    "of it, advertised her freedom.",
    "She said to her friend: I want",
    "all the fire one can have",
    "without being consumed by it.",
    "Clearly, I dreamt the woman too.",
    "I was surrounded by mountains",
    "suddenly green after a long winter,",
    "a chosen uprootedness, soul shake-up,",
    "every day a lesson about the vastness",
    "between ecstasy and repose.",
    "I drank coffee called Black Forest",
    "at the local cafe. I took long walks",
    "and tried to love the earth",
    "and hate its desecrations.",
    "All the Golden Retrievers wore red",
    "bandannas on those muttless streets.",
    "All the birches, I think, were aspens.",
    "I do not often remember my dreams,",
    "or dream of dreamers in them.",
    "To be without some of the things",
    "you want, a wise man said,",
    "is an indispensable part of happiness.",
    "I\u2019ve been paying attention",
    "to the sky again.",
    "I\u2019ve seen a ravine up there,",
    "and a narrow, black gorge.",
    "Not to worry, I tell myself,",
    "about tricks the mind plays,",
    "as long as you know they\u2019re tricks.",
    "If the rich are casually cruel",
    "perhaps it\u2019s because",
    "they can stare at the sky",
    "and never see an indictment",
    "in the shape of clouds.",
    "The frown, for example,",
    "in a thunderhead. The fist.",
    "That big mountain",
    "I\u2019ve been looking at\u2014",
    "I love how it borrows purple",
    "from the filtered light,",
    "sometimes red.",
    "Like any of us",
    "it\u2019s all of its appearances.",
    "It\u2019s good that the rich",
    "have to die,",
    "a peasant saying goes,",
    "otherwise they\u2019d live forever.",
    "Here in this rented house,",
    "high up, I understand.",
    "I\u2019m one of the rich",
    "for a while. The earth feels",
    "mine and the air I breathe",
    "is rarefied, if thin.",
    "Dusk now is making its last claim.",
    "I love the confluence",
    "of dark mountain, dark sky.",
    "Soon I won\u2019t know the beginning",
    "from the end.",

    "along for the ride.",
    "Those secret words repeated in mirrors\u2014",
    "someone\u2019s personal fog.",
    "A man\u2019s heart ransomed for comfort",
    "or a few extra bucks, his soul in rags.",
    "I have been him and him and him.",
    "Was it nobility or senility",
    "when my old grandmother tried to drown",
    "artificial flowers in the bathtub?",
    "Can only saints carry the load",
    "without talking about the burden?",
    "I want to lean into life,",
    "catch the faintest perfume.",
    "In every boy child an old man is dying.",
    "By middle age",
    "he begins to stink, complain.",
    "I want to have gifts for him",
    "when we finally meet.",
    "I want him to go out like an ancient",
    "Egyptian, surrounded",
    "by what is his, desiring nothing.",
    "A lost hour, and that animal lassitude",
    "after a vanished afternoon.",
    "Outside: joggers, cyclists.",
    "Motion, the great purifier, is theirs.",
    "If this were Europe someone in a tower",
    "might be ringing a bell.",
    "People hearing it would know",
    "similar truths, might even know",
    "exactly who they are.",
    "It\u2019s getting near drinking time.",
    "It\u2019s getting near getting near;",
    "a person alone conjures rules",
    "or can liquefy, fall apart.",
    "That woman with the bouffant\u2014",
    "chewing gum, waiting for the bus\u2014",
    "someone thinks she\u2019s beautiful.",
    "It\u2019s beautiful someone does.",
    "The sky\u2019s murmuring, the storm",
    "that calls you up,",
    "makes promises, never comes.",
    "Somewhere else, no doubt,",
    "a happy man slicing a tomato,",
    "a woman with a measuring cup.",
    "Somewhere else: the foreclosure",
    "of a feeling or a promise,",
    "followed by silence or shouts.",
    "Here, the slow dance of contingency,",
    "an afternoon connected to an evening",
    "by a slender wish. Sometimes absence",
    "makes the heart grow sluggish",
    "and desire only one person, or one thing.",
    "I am closing the curtains.",
    "I am helping the night.",
    "A few days ago I stopped looking",
    "at the photographs",
    "clustered on the wall, nudes,",
    "which had become dull to me,",
    "like a tourist\u2019s collection of smooth rocks.",
    "I turned away from the view",
    "and conjured a plague of starlings.",
    "Oh how they darkened the landscape.",
    "Surely such beauty had been waiting for its elegy.",
    "I felt like crushing a rhododendron.",
    "Now and again I feel the astonishment",
    "of being alive like this, in this body,",
    "the ventricles and the small bones",
    "in the hand, the intricacies of digestion ....",
    "When the radio said parents in California",
    "gave birth to another child",
    "so that their older child might have",
    "a bone-marrow transplant and",

    "for such complicated beauty.",
    "How wonderful the radio",
    "and its distant, human voices.",
    "The rain now is quite without consequence",
    "coming down.",
    "I suppose I\u2019ve come to the limits",
    "of my paltry resources, this hankering",
    "for people and for massive disturbance,",
    "then high pressure,",
    "the sequence that\u2019s been promised for days.",
    "I will long to be alone",
    "when my friends arrive.",
    "The body widens, and people are welcomed",
    "into it, many at a time. This must be",
    "what happens when we learn to be generous",
    "when we\u2019re not in love, or otherwise charmed.",
    "I\u2019ve been examining yesterday\u2019s ashes. I\u2019ve visited",
    "my own candleless altar. Little by little,",
    "the old selfish parts of me are loosening.",
    "I have a plan for becoming lean: to use",
    "all my fat in service of expansion. Have women",
    "always known this? Loveliness and fear",
    "when they open and let in and give away?",
    "The mountains here pierce the sky,",
    "and the sky, bountiful, closes in around them.",
    "Give me a new mouth; I want to talk.",

    "is the secret name",
    "for God, many-lettered, unpronounceable.",
    "There\u2019s a speakable grace",
    "in the fields and even in the cities.",
    "The grapes ripen, someone refuses to become",
    "a machine. And yet I want to talk",
    "about the worn-out husks of men and women",
    "returning from the factories,",
    "the venereal streets, the bruise history",
    "passes down to its forlorn children.",
    "I need a new mouth to acknowledge",
    "that piety will keep us small, imprisoned,",
    "that it\u2019s all right to be ridiculous",
    "and sway first to the left, then to the right,",
    "in order to find our balance.",
    "I\u2019ve been watching",
    "an evening star quiver. I\u2019ve been trying",
    "to identify the word before its utterance.",

    "between sycamore and cypress.",

    "for how passion gives rise to passion.",

    "are out tonight.",
    "I\u2019m close\u2014my other delusion goes\u2014",
    "to the heart of things.",
    "A young man with a young man\u2019s itch",
    "would rise and go out prowling.",
    "Tomorrow I\u2019ll choose a mountain",
    "that\u2019s a hill, take the slowest horse",
    "at the Lazy-7, slow and old,",
    "sure to know its trail.",
    "I knew a man who said he could dominate",
    "solitude. In other ways, too,",
    "he was a fool.",
    "Once I wanted to be",
    "one of those fabulous strangers",
    "who appear and disappear.",
    "Now I arrive only by invitation,",
    "stay long enough to earn my fare.",
    "Outside my window, clouds from the west",
    "erasing the stars.",
    "A coyote howling its singular news.",
    "At whatever pace,",
    "isn\u2019t there an imperative to live?",
    "Before a person dies he should experience",
    "the double fire,",
    "of what he wants and shouldn\u2019t have."

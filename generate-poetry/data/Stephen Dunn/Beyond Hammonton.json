    "The back roads I\u2019ve traveled late",
    "at night, alone, a little drunk,",
    "wishing I were someone",
    "on whom nothing is lost,",
    "are the roads by day I take",
    "to the car wash in Hammonton",
    "or to Blue Anchor\u2019s",
    "lawnmower repair shop",
    "when the self-propel mechanism goes.",
    "Fascinating how the lamplight",
    "that\u2019s beckoned",
    "from solitary windows",
    "gives way to white shutters",
    "and occasionally a woman",
    "in her yard, bending over",
    "something conspicuously in bloom.",
    "So much then is duty, duty, duty,",
    "and so much",
    "with the sun visor tilted",
    "and destination known",
    "can be endured.",
    "But at night . . . no, even at night",
    "so much can be endured.",
    "I\u2019ve known only one man",
    "who left the road,",
    "followed an intriguing light",
    "to its source.",
    "He told me",
    "that he knocked many times",
    "before it became clear to him",
    "he must break down the door."

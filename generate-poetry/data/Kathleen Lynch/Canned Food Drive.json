    "We lived in the lucky world\u2014",
    "not the far place where flies",
    "sipped at eye corners",
    "of children too weak to cry.",
    "A camera showed that world to us",
    "on posters. But we were children.",
    "We wanted most to not be those",
    "others, with their terrible bones.",
    "We spoke of them wide-eyed, with",
    "what we thought was tenderness.",
    "But our words came in a different register,",
    "as if to speak of such betrayal",
    "by the grown world could bring",
    "a harm of great immensity",
    "upon us too. We got to choose",
    "from the cupboard. We gave",
    "what we hated\u2014beets, peas,",
    "mushrooms. Our dreams",
    "were not of rice. The moon",
    "laid light on our bicycles propped",
    "against the porch. Sycamores",
    "became our giants standing guard;",
    "the overgrown shrub, our fort. We thought",
    "we understood what was required.",
    "Even crouched beneath our desks",
    "during drill, we said one prayer",
    "for the fear, one for recess.",
    "McClellan Air Force Base",
    "sent forth big-bellied planes",
    "that rattled the windows",
    "of our houses. Evenings, we took",
    "to the streets shrieking",
    "with joy, rode madly fast",
    "around the block. We collapsed",
    "on the lawn breathless, the earth",
    "cool beneath us & pounding hard,",
    "as if it had one great heart.",
    "As if it was ours."

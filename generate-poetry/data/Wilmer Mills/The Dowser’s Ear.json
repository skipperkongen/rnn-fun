    "Empty cattle trailers",
    "Rumbled dummy thunder",
    "Down the road all day, and now tonight,",
    "Heat lightning flashes more of the same fake rain.",
    "It\u2019s just as well. I couldn\u2019t get to sleep,",
    "And now it ricochets across the sky",
    "With empty loads of light. We\u2019ve had a month",
    "Of drought that tightens dirt around my pond.",
    "The local wells are dry. But I\u2019ve retired,",
    "Threw out my wand. I hate this time of year.",
    "Roux can burn if flour",
    "Sticks in skillet butter.",
    "I\u2019ve been cooking up a storm myself,",
    "My Daddy\u2019s fil\u00e9 gumbo recipe.",
    "He used to be a chef on oil rigs",
    "Until the hurricane. I heard the waves",
    "That killed him, and I hear them every year.",
    "It\u2019s emptiness that fills me. That\u2019s my skill.",
    "I hear the vacant rain before it falls.",
    "It\u2019s like the murmur of a spiraled shell.",
    "Hurricane weather, stewing",
    "Deep for landfall, spewing",
    "Rain-a-plenty in the Gulf and here",
    "In Tennessee they always have a lack",
    "Of something. Two men called today for wells.",
    "I told them both to go to hell, and now",
    "They think I\u2019m sinful, not to use my skill.",
    "They stand to lose so much, but don\u2019t we all.",
    "I lost a lot in Hurricane Camille",
    "And even now can\u2019t hear the end of it.",
    "More heat lightning flashes,",
    "Absent rain that passes",
    "Over clouds, and I can make it out,",
    "Each gurgling current under withered fields,",
    "Down kitchen drains. The neighbors think I\u2019m crazy,",
    "Up all hours, but they\u2019ll never know",
    "The screaming voice inside a breaker\u2019s rage",
    "Or how it simmers in my ear. I hate",
    "The sound of water. Give me one good chance",
    "To make it silent. I\u2019d be right as rain."

    "She minces squid and a marinated scallion,",
    "Mixes rice with shrimp and olive paste. . . .",
    "Hope for the English meal, though half Italian",
    "With her jet black hair and her elastic waist.",
    "Unlike the other television cooks,",
    "She brings to life a lobster that was dead",
    "With common spices, her exotic looks,",
    "And recipes she dreamed about in bed."

    "The rock lives in the desert, solid, taking its time.",
    "The wave lives for an instant, stable in momentum",
    "at the edge of the sea, before it folds away.",
    "Everything that is, lives and has size.",
    "The mole sleeps in a hole of its making,",
    "and the hole also lives; absence is not nothing.",
    "It didn\u2019t desire to be, but now it breathes",
    "and makes a place, for the comfort of the mole.",
    "I am a space taken, and my absence will be shapely",
    "and of a certain age, in the everlasting.",
    "In the fierce evening, on the mild day,",
    "How long shall I be shaken?",
    "(Habakkuk)"

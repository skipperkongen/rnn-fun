    "By such an all-embalming summer day",
    "As sweetens now among the mountain pines",
    "Down to the cornland yonder and the vines,",
    "To where the sky and sea are mixed in gray,",
    "How do all things together take their way",
    "Harmonious to the harvest, bringing wines",
    "And bread and light and whatsoe\u2019er combines",
    "In the large wreath to make it round and gay.",
    "To me my troubled life doth now appear",
    "Like scarce distinguishable summits hung",
    "Around the blue horizon: places where",
    "Not even a traveller purposeth to steer,\u2014",
    "Whereof a migrant bird in passing sung,",
    "And the girl closed her window not to hear."

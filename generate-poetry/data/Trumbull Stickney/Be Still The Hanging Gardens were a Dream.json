    "Be still. The Hanging Gardens were a dream",
    "That over Persian roses flew to kiss",
    "The curl\u00e8d lashes of Semiramis.",
    "Troy never was, nor green Skamander stream.",
    "Provence and Troubadour are merest lies",
    "The glorious hair of Venice was a beam",
    "Made within Titian\u2019s eye. The sunsets seem,",
    "The world is very old and nothing is.",
    "Be still. Thou foolish thing, thou canst not wake,",
    "Nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart,",
    "But patter in the darkness of thy heart.",
    "Thy brain is plagued. Thou art a frighted owl",
    "Blind with the light of life thou \u2019ldst not forsake,",
    "And Error loves and nourishes thy soul."

    "Live blindly and upon the hour. The Lord,",
    "Who was the Future, died full long ago.",
    "Knowledge which is the Past is folly. Go,",
    "Poor child, and be not to thyself abhorred.",
    "Around thine earth sun-wing\u00e8d winds do blow",
    "And planets roll; a meteor draws his sword;",
    "The rainbow breaks his seven-coloured chord",
    "And the long strips of river-silver flow:",
    "Awake! Give thyself to the lovely hours.",
    "Drinking their lips, catch thou the dream in flight",
    "About their fragile hairs\u2019 a\u00ebrial gold.",
    "Thou art divine, thou livest,\u2014as of old",
    "Apollo springing naked to the light,",
    "And all his island shivered into flowers."

    "I used to think",
    "The mind essential in the body, even",
    "As stood the body essential in the mind:",
    "Two inseparable things, by nature equal",
    "And similar, and in creation\u2019s song",
    "Halving the total scale: it is not so.",
    "Unlike and cross like driftwood sticks they come",
    "Churned in the giddy trough: a chunk of pine,",
    "A slab of rosewood: mangled each on each",
    "With knocks and friction, or in deadly pain",
    "Sheathing each other\u2019s splinters: till at last",
    "Without all stuff or shape they \u2019re jetted up",
    "Where in the bluish moisture rot whate\u2019er",
    "Was vomited in horror from the sea."

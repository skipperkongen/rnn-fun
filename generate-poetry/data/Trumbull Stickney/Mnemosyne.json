    "It\u2019s autumn in the country I remember.",
    "How warm a wind blew here about the ways!",
    "And shadows on the hillside lay to slumber",
    "During the long sun-sweetened summer-days.",
    "It\u2019s cold abroad the country I remember.",
    "The swallows veering skimmed the golden grain",
    "At midday with a wing aslant and limber;",
    "And yellow cattle browsed upon the plain.",
    "It\u2019s empty down the country I remember.",
    "I had a sister lovely in my sight:",
    "Her hair was dark, her eyes were very sombre;",
    "We sang together in the woods at night.",
    "It\u2019s lonely in the country I remember.",
    "The babble of our children fills my ears,",
    "And on our hearth I stare the perished ember",
    "To flames that show all starry thro\u2019 my tears.",
    "It\u2019s dark about the country I remember.",
    "There are the mountains where I lived. The path",
    "Is slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber,",
    "The stumps are twisted by the tempests\u2019 wrath.",
    "But that I knew these places are my own,",
    "I\u2019d ask how came such wretchedness to cumber",
    "The earth, and I to people it alone.",
    "It rains across the country I remember."

    "'And all her silken flanks with garlands drest'\u2014",
    "But we are coming to the sacrifice.",

    "This must be the floweriest place",
    "That earth allows; the queenly face",
    "Of the proud mansion borrows grace for grace",
    "Spite of those brute guns lowing at the skies.",
    "Bold great daisies' golden lights,",
    "Bubbling roses' pinks and whites\u2014",
    "Such a gay carpet! poppies by the million;",
    "Such damask! such vermilion!",
    "But if you ask me, mate, the choice of colour",
    "Is scarcely right; this red should have been duller."

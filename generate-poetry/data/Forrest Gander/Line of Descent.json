    "Against the backdark, bright",
    "riband flickers of heat lightning. Nearer",

    "and glimmering brim",
    "against light lifting there. And here, pitched over",

    "a tent, its wan, cakey,",

    "out in front of them its magisterial consequence, cramming",
    "vertiginous air down its throat\u2014",
    "from the scarp."

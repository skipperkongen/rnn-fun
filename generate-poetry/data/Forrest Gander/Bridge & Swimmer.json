    "Our eye goes past the hieroglyphic tree to the swimmer",
    "carving a wake in the water. And almost to the railroad bridge",
    "from which the swimmer might have dived. Then, as though",
    "come to the end of its tether,",
    "our gaze returns, pulling toward the blemish",
    "on the surface of the print. An L-shaped chemical dribble,",
    "it sabotages the scene\u2019s transparence",
    "and siphons off its easy appeal.",
    "At the same time, the blemish",
    "joins together the realms",
    "of seer and swimmer",
    "in our experience of plunging",
    "into and out of the image."

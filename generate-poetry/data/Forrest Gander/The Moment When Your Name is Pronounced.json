    "This high up, the face",
    "eroding; the red cedar slopes",
    "over. An accident chooses a stranger.",
    "Each rain unplugs roots",
    "which thin out like a hand.",
    "Above the river, heat",
    "lightning flicks silently",
    "and the sound holds, coiled in air.",
    "Some nights you are here",
    "dangling a Valpolicella bottle,",
    "staring down at the flat water",
    "that slides by with its mouth full of starlight.",
    "It is always quiet",
    "when we finish the wine.",
    "While you were a living man",
    "how many pictures were done",
    "of you. Serious as an angel,",
    "lacing up your boots. Ice",
    "blows into my fields."

    "I\u2019ll know the time to leave the room",
    "where I\u2019ve been growing hair",
    "from my face, drinking dark beers",
    "when the light in the lake bums out.",
    "That\u2019s when fish",
    "turn on their music.",
    "They lie in a blue current",
    "waiting for the moon",
    "to pass over, and the fishermen",
    "with their lanterns know this",
    "as they spill a can of sweet corn",
    "and wonder if they spoke",
    "what they were just thinking.",
    "I clear my way through the fog",
    "as music will break through static.",
    "The frogs strike up,",
    "a window goes out",
    "in the Home for Elders.",
    "Don\u2019t you wonder why",
    "it is built far from anywhere,",
    "as though memory needs a terrain",
    "for forgetting; blind",
    "driveways to lost roads.",
    "As for my own parents, they did not",
    "grow old. What I know:",
    "dinners without conversation,",
    "stars that shine for anyone.",
    "I know my time",
    "is brief. I know love of the cut sleeve.",
    "I want to say",
    "don\u2019t feel sorry for men,",
    "those who leave women",
    "smouldering like cigarettes,",
    "those who are fond of burials.",
    "War is a habit of mind,",
    "I swear by my mother\u2019s gender.",
    "Tonight sticks in the leaves",
    "are slick as pilot snakes.",
    "Wherever I part branches",
    "no one is in a boat,",
    "no one has stirred a wake.",
    "Not jackknifing off the dock,",
    "it\u2019s hauling myself back up",
    "that gooses my titties and makes my peter shrink.",
    "Don\u2019t wake the cottonmouths.",
    "Summertime. If you were here",
    "and you remembered to stash your smokes",
    "in a Glad bag so they didn\u2019t soak like mine",
    "we\u2019d fall quiet now as pollen",
    "on water, I would",
    "tell you the true story of Urashima",
    "and the turtle."

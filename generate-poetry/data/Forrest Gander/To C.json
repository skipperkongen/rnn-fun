    "Inside, inside the return, inside, the hero diminishes.",
    "Over her vessel they place a veil, and when it is lifted",
    "the name of the vessel has been lost. Consider",
    "the darkness of the water which has no scent",
    "and neither can it swallow. Yet the ship\u2019s bow",
    "extends over the proscenium like a horse",
    "at a fence and the orchestra stands and files out.",
    "On the long walk home, I long to see your face."

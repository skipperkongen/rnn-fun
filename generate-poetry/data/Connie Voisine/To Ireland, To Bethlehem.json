    "bright blue tumbles across the screen mutely, foam",
    "collapsing over a tiny nimble figure",
    "but she darts through to a green glow,",
    "sunshine through a veil of wave, her surfboard tense between",
    "her feet and the world\u2019s largest ocean. Her ride",
    "is long, impossibly long\u2014her hips stay low, a friend",
    "drops onto her wave and, together, they glide towards the shore.",
    "No music. Just water and that blue. I check the SkyMall catalogue",
    "for something I might need and didn\u2019t know. There are",
    "reasons I am flying over the ocean, reasons I",
    "I wish I were sure of. Someday I might say,",
    ". Or maybe we\u2019ll be old and",
    "surrounded by our own. The screen flashes;",
    "the surf is wild, but the bright sky makes me whisper,",
    ", where nothing could be that beautiful",
    "but is. The waves are bigger and she sets out, flowered",
    "bikini, hair pulled back in a serious bun.",
    "But too soon she\u2019s underwater, arms above her head,",

    "sweet ocean, and those few younger girls",
    "who try to ride it. And what a night,",
    "warmed by the sun-shocked smell",
    "of saddle and sweat, the strong breath of camels.",
    "What carved, fragrant trunkfuls",
    "born across deserts and ready to be opened before an infant god."

    "It could of course be silk. Fifty yards or so",
    "of the next closest thing to water to the touch,",
    "or it could just as easily be a shaft of wood",
    "crumpling a man struck between spaulder and helm.",
    "But now, with the rain making a noisy erasure",
    "of this town, it is the flash that arrives",
    "and leaves at nearly the same moment. It\u2019s what I want",
    "to be in this moment, in this doorway,",
    "because much as I\u2019d love to be the silk-shimmer",
    "against the curve of anyone\u2019s arm,",
    "as brutal and impeccable as it\u2019d be to soar",
    "from a crossbow with a whistle and have a man",
    "switch off upon my arrival, it is nothing",
    "compared to that moment when I eat the dark,",
    "draw shadows in quick strokes across wall",
    "and start a tongue counting",
    "down to thunder. That counting that says,",
    "I am this far. I am this close."

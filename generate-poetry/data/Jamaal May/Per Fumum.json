    "My mother became an ornithologist",
    "when the grackle tumbled through barbecue smoke",
    "and fell at her feet. Soon she learned",
    "why singers cage birds; it can take weeks",
    "to memorize a melody \u2014",
    "the first days lost as they mope",
    "and warble a friendless note,",
    "the same tone every animal memorizes",
    "hours into breathing. It\u2019s a note",
    "a cologne would emit if the bottle was struck",
    "while something mystical was aligned",
    "with something even more mystical",
    "but farther away. My father was an astronomer",
    "for forty minutes in a row",
    "the first time a bus took us so far",
    "from streetlights he could point out constellations",
    "that may or may not have been Draco,",
    "Orion, Aquila, or Crux.",
    "When they faded I resented the sun\u2019s excess,",
    "a combination of fires I couldn\u2019t smell.",
    "The first chemist was a perfumer",
    "whose combinations, brushed",
    "against pulse points, were unlocked",
    "by quickening blood. From stolen perfumes",
    "I concocted my personal toxin.",
    "It was no more deadly than as much water",
    "to any creature the size of a roach. I grew suspicious",
    "of my plate and lighter Bunsen burner,",
    "the tiny vials accumulating in my closet.",
    "I was a chemist for months",
    "before I learned the difference",
    "between poisoned and drowned.",
    "When my bed caught fire",
    "it smelled like a garden."

    "Don\u2019t listen to me; my heart\u2019s been broken.",
    "I don\u2019t see anything objectively.",
    "I know myself; I\u2019ve learned to hear like a psychiatrist.",
    "When I speak passionately,",
    "that\u2019s when I\u2019m least to be trusted.",
    "It\u2019s very sad, really: all my life, I\u2019ve been praised",
    "for my intelligence, my powers of language, of insight.",
    "In the end, they\u2019re wasted\u2014",
    "I never see myself,",
    "standing on the front steps, holding my sister\u2019s hand.",
    "That\u2019s why I can\u2019t account",
    "for the bruises on her arm, where the sleeve ends.",
    "In my own mind, I\u2019m invisible: that\u2019s why I\u2019m dangerous.",
    "People like me, who seem selfless,",
    "we\u2019re the cripples, the liars;",
    "we\u2019re the ones who should be factored out",
    "in the interest of truth.",
    "When I\u2019m quiet, that\u2019s when the truth emerges.",
    "A clear sky, the clouds like white fibers.",
    "Underneath, a little gray house, the azaleas",
    "red and bright pink.",
    "If you want the truth, you have to close yourself",
    "to the older daughter, block her out:",
    "when a living thing is hurt like that,",
    "in its deepest workings,",
    "all function is altered.",
    "That\u2019s why I\u2019m not to be trusted.",
    "Because a wound to the heart",
    "is also a wound to the mind."

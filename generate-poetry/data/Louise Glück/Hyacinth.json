    "1",
    "Is that an attitude for a flower, to stand",
    "like a club at the walk; poor slain boy,",
    "is that a way to show",
    "gratitude to the gods? White",
    "with colored hearts, the tall flowers",
    "sway around you, all the other boys,",
    "in the cold spring, as the violets open.",
    "2",
    "There were no flowers in antiquity",
    "but boys\u2019 bodies, pale, perfectly imagined.",
    "So the gods sank to human shape with longing.",
    "In the field, in the willow grove,",
    "Apollo sent the courtiers away.",
    "3",
    "And from the blood of the wound",
    "a flower sprang, lilylike, more brilliant",
    "than the purples of Tyre.",
    "Then the god wept: his vital grief",
    "flooded the earth.",
    "4",
    "Beauty dies: that is the source",
    "of creation. Outside the ring of trees",
    "the courtiers could hear",
    "the dove\u2019s call transmit",
    "its uniform, its inborn sorrow\u2014",
    "They stood listening, among the rustling willows.",
    "Was this the god\u2019s lament?",
    "They listened carefully. And for a short time",
    "all sound was sad.",
    "5",
    "There is no other immortality:",
    "in the cold spring, the purple violets open.",
    "And yet, the heart is black,",
    "there is its violence frankly exposed.",
    "Or is it not the heart at the center",
    "but some other word?",
    "And now someone is bending over them,",
    "meaning to gather them\u2014",
    "6",
    "They could not wait",
    "in exile forever.",
    "Through the glittering grove",
    "the courtiers ran",
    "calling the name",
    "of their companion",
    "over the birds\u2019 noise,",
    "over the willows\u2019 aimless sadness.",
    "Well into the night they wept,",
    "their clear tears",
    "altering no earthly color."

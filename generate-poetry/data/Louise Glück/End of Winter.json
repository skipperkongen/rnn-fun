    "Over the still world, a bird calls",

    "in the way of your pleasure?",
    "Plunging ahead",
    "into the dark and light at the same time",
    "eager for sensation",
    "as though you were some new thing, wanting",
    "to express yourselves",
    "all brilliance, all vivacity",
    "never thinking",
    "this would cost you anything,",
    "never imagining the sound of my voice",
    "as anything but part of you\u2014",
    "you won't hear it in the other world,",
    "not clearly again,",
    "not in birdcall or human cry,",
    "not the clear sound, only",
    "persistent echoing",
    "in all sound that means good-bye, good-bye\u2014",
    "the one continuous line",
    "that binds us to each other."

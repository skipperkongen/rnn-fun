    "You saved me, you should remember me.",
    "The spring of the year; young men buying tickets for the ferryboats.",
    "Laughter, because the air is full of apple blossoms.",
    "When I woke up, I realized I was capable of the same feeling.",
    "I remember sounds like that from my childhood,",
    "laughter for no cause, simply because the world is beautiful,",
    "something like that.",
    "Lugano. Tables under the apple trees.",
    "Deckhands raising and lowering the colored flags.",
    "And by the lake\u2019s edge, a young man throws his hat into the water;",
    "perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him.",
    "Crucial",
    "sounds or gestures like",
    "a track laid down before the larger themes",
    "and then unused, buried.",
    "Islands in the distance. My mother",
    "holding out a plate of little cakes\u2014",
    "as far as I remember, changed",
    "in no detail, the moment",
    "vivid, intact, having never been",
    "exposed to light, so that I woke elated, at my age",
    "hungry for life, utterly confident\u2014",
    "By the tables, patches of new grass, the pale green",
    "pieced into the dark existing ground.",
    "Surely spring has been returned to me, this time",
    "not as a lover but a messenger of death, yet",
    "it is still spring, it is still meant tenderly."

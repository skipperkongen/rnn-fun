    "The foyer is hers because the kettle is hers as it was made for water and the water is hers",
    "because the sac that grew the baby was hers though the semen that made the sac was his",
    "like his boots are his and the tea that\u2019s of the kettle",
    "after it enters his mouth is his unless it\u2019s hers since it\u2019s inside the kitchen that\u2019s hers",
    "and therefore not his unless he\u2019s simmering the Asian sauces that are his",
    "because they\u2019re dense and knotty rather than milkish and paltry",
    "like everything else from the nation state of the motherland",
    "of the no-mercy child who won\u2019t stop sucking and wanting and whining in the ear that is his",
    "although the child herself belongs somehow to the woman and thus its hunger is hers",
    "as is the bed and dresser and mirror and latch",
    "though the hammer naturally is his and the saw and lumber",
    "and back and muscle he suffered to build because he guessed he thought it would be",
    "good for something besides this house like a pestilence of people who weren\u2019t his",
    "because nothing was his except the whirl he carried in his belly of the mix-up",
    "of loving her in the first place like being sucked",
    "into a burrow of lava embers and putting your tongue to it until it caught fire",
    "and all he could say was that the",
    "was his\u2014this hole in the mouth\u2014",
    "this fiasco of the woman bent now in the garden to smell the cilantro",
    "as though she didn\u2019t know his head was split",
    "with hating her and loving her and hating her and loving her",
    "because she was an ache and a kink and somehow the furrow\u2014the groove and the rut\u2014",
    "and age and death and kiss and fuck and not-fuck and song and not-song",
    "and no it was not sweet though he\u2019d go on and carry it",
    "since also\u2014since mostly\u2014it was."

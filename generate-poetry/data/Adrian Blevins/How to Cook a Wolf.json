    "If your mother\u2019s like mine wanting you honeyed and blithe",
    "you\u2019ll get cooked by getting evicted",
    "since the mothers can teach with a dustpan the tons of modes of tossing.",
    "And the fathers will lift your eyes too-early-too-open:",
    "the fathers can creep up on anything when it\u2019s still too wet",
    "to cloister with their weeping and strand you like a seed",
    "or cook at the carnivals with the can-do caroling",
    "and storefronts and foodstuffs and annulments and Scotch",
    "and off-handed fucking and walking out and moving on",
    "until they\u2019re cooking the drift of you wanting a whole bayou up in you",
    "and cooking and cooking the gist",
    "of you needing your crannies hot with a good man\u2019s body-silt",
    "until your head is stuffed with a pining for diapers",
    "and the most minuscule spoons made mostly of silver",
    "and Ajax too and Minwax Oh",
    "in this the dumbstruck story of the American female",
    "as a cut of terracotta and some kindling in a dress",
    "while howling at the marrow of the marrow of the bone."

    "I called up tech and got the voicemail code.",
    "It\u2019s taken me this long to find my feet.",
    "Since last we spoke that evening it has snowed.",
    "Fifty-four new messages. Most are old",
    "and blinking into a future months complete.",
    "I contacted tech to get my voicemail code",
    "to hear your voice, not some bozo on the road",
    "the week of Thanksgiving dubbing me his sweet",
    "and breaking up and bleating how it snowed",
    "the Nashville side of Chattanooga and slowed",
    "the beltway to a standstill. The radio said sleet.",
    "The kid in tech sent on my voicemail code.",
    "I blew a night on lightening the system\u2019s load,",
    "woke to white enveloping the trees, the street",
    "that\u2019s blanked out by my leaving. It had snowed.",
    "Lately others\u2019 pasts will turn me cold.",
    "I heard out every message, pressed delete.",
    "I\u2019d happily forget my voice, the mail, its code.",
    "We spoke at last that evening. Then it snowed."

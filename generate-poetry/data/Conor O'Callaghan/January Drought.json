    "It needn\u2019t be tinder, this juncture of the year,",
    "a cigarette second guessed from car to brush.",

    "to cracking asunder the first puff of wind.",

    "But tonight is buckets of stars as hard and dry as dimes.",
    "A month\u2019s supper things stacks in the sink.",
    "Tea brews from water stoppered in the bath",
    "and any thirst carried forward is quenched thinking you,",
    "piece by piece, an Xmas gift hidden",
    "and found weeks after: the ribbon, the box.",
    "I have reservoirs of want enough",
    "to freeze many nights over."

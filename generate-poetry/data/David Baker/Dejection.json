    "Vesuvius by torch light, who",
    "collapses with agonizing pain in his side.",
    "Now his chamber is rebellion",
    "enough. He bears down, scratching lines",
    "on the back of the stanzas he",
    "will later discard: \u201cMy head is wild",
    "with weeping!\u201d Famous among friends",

    "Alas! I have not hope nor health,",
    "Nor peace within, etc....",
    "Mary writes in her journal of",
    "the days. Still, Pompeii staggers him,",
    "and its distant, deep peals rattle",
    "like subterranean thunder",
    "beneath the family\u2019s lodging rooms.",
    "The lightning of the noontide ocean is flashing",
    "around me, etc.... How",

    "the structure, which Mr Shelley",
    "would build upon this vast heap of",

    "all his life lies ahead. The bay",
    "burns wild beyond his window",
    "in holy admixtures of fire",
    "and water ... the grand effusion",
    "symbolic but real to him",

    "the Elysian Fields, the Caverns of the Sibyl ...",

    "The fires of new thought swell in his",

    "branches of those delicate weeds",
    "that pave the unequal bottom of the water."

    "It was midday before we noticed it was morning.",
    "The boy cousins brought us a tray\u2014soup and cheese,",
    "warm soda, and a soft cloth and candy for her fever.",
    "They wouldn\u2019t come in, the tray weighing between them.",
    "They stood like woodwork inside the door frame.",
    "By afternoon the old procession\u2014silence at the lip",
    "of a dozen night travelers tired and grieving, one",
    "by one, or pairs floating to the bed and back",
    "with a touching of hands like humming,",
    "and the one we gathered for slipping farther",
    "for all the good we could do. She lay in her shadow.",
    "She looked to no one. Her daylilies bobbed wide",
    "open out in the wild, blue sun and the same bee",
    "kept nosing her window to reach them.",
    "Dusk: even the boys were back watching it try."

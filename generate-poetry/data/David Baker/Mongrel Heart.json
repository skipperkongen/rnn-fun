    "Up the dog bounds to the window, baying",
    "like a basset his doleful, tearing sounds",
    "from the belly, as if mourning a dead king,",
    "and now he\u2019s howling like a beagle \u2013 yips, brays,",
    "gagging growls \u2013 and scratching the sill paintless,",
    "that\u2019s how much he\u2019s missed you, the two of you,",
    "both of you, mother and daughter, my wife",
    "and child. All week he\u2019s curled at my feet,",
    "warming himself and me watching more TV,",
    "or wandered the lonely rooms, my dog shadow,",
    "who like a poodle now hops, amped-up windup",
    "maniac yo-yo with matted curls and snot nose",
    "smearing the panes, having heard another car",
    "like yours taking its grinding turn down",
    "our block, or a school bus, or bird-squawk,",
    "that\u2019s how much he\u2019s missed you, good dog,",
    "companion dog, dog-of-all-types, most excellent dog",
    "I told you once and for all we should never get."

    "Years ago,",
    "under a sweet June sky",
    "stung with stars and swept back by black leaves",

    "under this sky,",
    "a beautiful woman killed me, nearly.",
    "I say beautiful. You had to see her.",
    "she said,",
    "and turned a lovely shell of her ear",
    "to the swirl of stars",

    "smudged as a wingtip in one tree, not far.",
    "Yes: she scraped my back bloody against a rough trunk.",
    "Yes: she flung back her lovely face",
    "and her hair, holding me down,",

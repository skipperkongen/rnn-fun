    "If things were worse, this cursed rain",
    "would soak me unto sickness,",
    "so Samuel Sewall might have",
    "written in his vespers journal.",
    "I have it on my writing desk",
    "inside. For three days I have",
    "labored with a saw and plane",
    "and many boards to make my girl",
    "a swingset near her mother\u2019s",
    "lilac shrubs, as rain has drizzled",
    "cold and meaningless. How",
    "coherent was his world of works",
    "and days, when",
    "might connote a coming",
    "providence\u2014so Sewall notes",
    "of Her Majesty\u2019s Court, June",
    "the eighteenth, seventeen twelve.",
    "of our Money\u2014",
    "as on the same day clearly he",
    "is mindful to remember that",
    "one foot was between the Windmill, and the",
    "Lazar house; other, on Dorchester Neck.",
    "How faithful is the mind in",
    "memory, connecting signs.",
    "As the body of the Word",
    "of God strides His world, so",
    "Sam.'s determination to forge",
    "meaning from his life\u2019s",
    ".",
    "The day before, just this:",
    "Bulbs of lilac blooms burn like",
    "black lights in the twilight. Rain",
    "ascends in a mist where it has",
    "fallen to the rich new grass.",
    "It\u2019s Sunday, nearly dark, and",
    "tomorrow I\u2019m back in class to",
    "shape my working days. I think",
    "of him who keeps the task of church",
    "and colony. He leans each night",
    "long over paper waiting",
    "on his writing desk. She can\u2019t wait,",
    "my girl, to play on her swings.",
    "long, 40. foot wide. Got to Cousin Woodbridge\u2019s",
    "a little before Sunset. Saw an appearance of",
    "a Rainbow-Colour about the bigness of a piece",
    "of Timber one foot square and four foot long.",
    "When I had turn \u2019d from it, Somebody, call\u2019d",
    "to me to look on the Sight; and then it was",
    "dilated like an Ensign with several bars in it.",
    "Saw my daughter Judith.",
    "It\u2019s what we connect. It\u2019s how",
    "we join each thing with care. If I",
    "soap a screw to drive it smoother,",
    "if I run the ripsaw straight",
    "against the wood grain down the meat",
    "of my thumb, if the brackets hold,",
    "if swivels keep the swings aligned,",
    "it\u2019s because my father passed",
    "a memory of such things to me.",
    "Now I only work to make a toy.",
    "My colleagues call that irony.",
    "(Our meager making wants to",
    "theorize each life we touch to death.)",
    "If things were worse, I don\u2019t know if",
    "I could make a living with my hands.",
    "If things were worse than that, I could.",
    "of it caused another faint Rainbow to the",
    "westward of it. For the entire Compleateness",
    "of it, throughout the whole Arch, and for its",
    "duration, the like has been rarely seen. The",
    "middle parts were discontinued for a while; but",
    "the former Integrity and Splendor were quickly",
    "Recovered. I hope this is a sure Token that",
    "CHRIST Remembers his Covenant, and that He will",
    "make haste to prepare for them a City that has",
    "foundations, whose Builder and Maker is GOD.",
    "My father circles in his",
    "anger now. A stroke like lightning",
    "shot his carotid artery one day.",
    "He forgets himself. I\u2019m worried",
    "that my daughter may recall",
    "my temper only, or my",
    "little soul, my careless way",
    "of cutting others down. The rage",
    "for meaning makes us look for things",
    "in other things, makes us hope",
    "we see the future when we barely",
    "see the day. I\u2019ve beheld my girl",
    "angry, impatient with the smallest",
    "cause, cruel beyond her years.",
    "and 4 P.M., being drown\u2019d with Dropsie.",
    "News comes that Capt. Carver is Taken by two",
    "Privateers. Just as had written this I went to look",
    "of the Rain at my East-Chamber window, and",
    "saw a perfect Rainbow. I think the setting of",
    "the Sun caus\u2019d its Disappearance. Laus Deo.",
    "I put one good board beside",
    "another and screw them down\u2014so",
    "things won\u2019t come apart, so she",
    "won\u2019t fall. I think we wish too hard",
    "for sense when what we want",
    "is wonder, swinging on a toy.",
    "I love the life we\u2019ve made despite",
    "our carelessness. I love the care.",
    "preaches: Work out your Salvation with Fear.",
    "One night later, one more entry,",
    "so Sewall becomes his vision.",
    "Hirst in a little Closet to pray with her;",
    "and of a sudden she was gon, I could not",
    "tell how; although the Closet was so small,",
    "and not Cumber\u2019d with Chairs or Shelves,",
    "I was much affected with it when I waked.",
    "The mind is faithful in its",
    "memory\u2014connecting signs,",
    "it makes a memory",
    "to connect to what it needs.",
    "The body will forget us all",
    "anyway, in time, as it forgets",
    "its breath, and how to live,",
    "how to forgive. I keep this",
    "story close whenever I grieve",
    "or fear, growing cold. A father",
    "and his child wait through a storm.",
    "Fear has",
    "drenched the child. (Is this my father,",
    "or me, my girl, or someone",
    "in a book? I don\u2019t remember.",
    "Forgetfulness has taken part",
    "of me already\u2014besides,",
    "it doesn\u2019t matter.) The child cries,",
    "I\u2019m scared, to which the father",
    "whispers, holding on, Don\u2019t worry,",
    "little one. I'll stay with you until",
    "it\u2019s over. It\u2019s what he means by"

    "A short ride in the van, then the eight of us",
    "there in the heat\u2014white shirtsleeves sticking,",
    "the women\u2019s gloves off\u2014fanning our faces.",
    "The workers had set up a big blue tent",
    "to help us at graveside tolerate the sun,",
    "which was brutal all afternoon as if",
    "stationed above us, though it moved limb",
    "to limb through two huge, covering elms.",
    "The long processional of neighbors, friends,",
    "the town\u2019s elderly, her beauty-shop patrons,",
    "her club\u2019s notables. . . The world is full of",
    "prayers arrived at from afterwards, he said.",
    "Look up through the trees\u2014the hands, the leaves",
    "curled as in self-control or quietly hurting,",
    "or now open, flat-palmed, many-fine-veined,",
    "and whether from heat or sadness, waving."

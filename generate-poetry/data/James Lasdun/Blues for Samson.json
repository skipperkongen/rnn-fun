    "My stylist",
    "calls me darling,",
    "says Hi I\u2019m Dee, and asks what I\u2019d like today, smiling.",
    "My hair back, I tell her, my precious locks,",
    "thick and unruly and glossy as they were",
    "before I was fleeced.",
    "Her laughter",
    "as she switches",
    "the clippers on, brings back that sweet-throated witch\u2019s",
    "who comforted me as only your enemy can",
    "in the days of my strength, when I smote",
    "hip and thigh in a great slaughter.",
    "Her nice eyes",
    "by and by rest",
    "on mine in the mirror. She leans in, letting her breast",
    "brush against me. She knows her middle-aged man;",
    "playing me like some trailer Delilah,",
    "and I feel it rise;",
    "the old blunt",
    "want-instrument",
    "that always and only wanted what it shouldn\u2019t;",
    "Gaza, Timna, my Valley girl",
    "who spilled me in broad daylight. I must have reckoned",
    "the sun shone out of her cunt.",
    "Too long now",
    "bereft of it,",
    "a woman\u2019s hands in my hair, or what\u2019s left of it,",
    "is all I seem to require of love,",
    "and all I\u2019ll spill is a tip, Dee; big as my straitened",
    "circumstances allow,",
    "for Dee, once",
    "my head wasn\u2019t bare",
    "as that cornfield after the foxes I set on fire",
    "rampaged through it, or the orchards and olive groves",
    "I flattened with my slat-armored D9 \u2019dozer,",
    "but maned like a lion\u2019s."

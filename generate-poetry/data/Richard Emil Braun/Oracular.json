    "Over the honored bones of Boston (resting,",
    "as we say) old leaves\u2019 bones",
    "underfoot are restless; and boys and schoolgirls",
    "going home splash through them,",
    "reciting alphabet lately received.",
    "They run the known, intone",
    "the unsure patterns, repeat the magic,",
    "nearly Grecian syllables;",
    "and little winds are winding up their strident",
    "lmno, R, S, T.",
    "She was no snowy witch, but young and turning,",
    "a mother-dear more dear now",
    "incipiently frosty; witches most live",
    "when she died, October;",
    "primly colonial, Mother Goose\u2019s grave;",
    "who did not rhyme or gather",
    "the pages vainly: what mantic abc\u2019s",
    "she told she dared make charming",
    "only to spell her children\u2019s moral lives.",
    "The children passing sing",
    "the future, certainly, but knowing nothing",
    "(as the lore requires)",
    "and recommending nothing as they are",
    "merely oracles",
    "spelling their letters\u2019 lives, not telling theirs.",
    "They have their own games",
    "not of the elder nation; certain cobwebs",
    "accommodate the young,",
    "and special weeds; and these who chant now know",
    "no gentle Sibylla",
    "but many seemingly answering leaves.",
    "What there will be of signs,",
    "of sounds so flighty and so friable,",
    "the letters as the leaves,",
    "boys and girls as letters, and of late",
    "Boston\u2019s honorable",
    "cinders, laid quietly and always restless:",
    "maybe a daisy, my dears,",
    "or a white carnation, or only an",
    "unanswerable tenderness."

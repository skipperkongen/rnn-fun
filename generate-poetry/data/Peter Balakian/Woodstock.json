    "In the mud of a tire rut,",
    "we were the filaments.",
    "We said if Mrs. Agnew could make music",
    "on Spiro\u2019s flute",
    "we said the clubs in the hands of the Chicago cops",
    "would liquefy.",
    "The trees shook with the throb of steel.",
    "What did we do to be so red, white, and blue?",
    "We were inexorable",
    "like the dialectic unraveling from Hanoi",
    "to the Jacksonian grass.",
    "We were the inebriates of vitamin C and cocaine,",
    "the daughters of the gray flannel suit.",
    "And when the shaman spread his yellow robe like the sun",
    "he was all teeth and amp",
    "and what were we?"

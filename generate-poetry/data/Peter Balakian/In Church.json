    "1",
    "In the rheumatic heat of July,",
    "when Public Enemy blared",
    "on the blasters",
    "in a time when arbitrage",
    "and foreign policy",
    "were bureaus of each other,",
    "I made a wrong turn off Broadway",
    "and wound up at St. John the Divine",
    "where I sat in the hot dark",
    "until the traffic died.",
    "*",
    "And a voice comes over",
    "some columns to the breeze of the Golden Horn",
    "over the cypress groves",
    "and flowing bougainvillea",
    "where the bright blue weather and the old",
    "seawalls come together,",
    "where crates of cardamom",
    "and musk are piled and",
    "the cattle hang in blood",
    "above the brass,",
    "where the grain boats",
    "stink and red pleasure",
    "barges drift where Jason",
    "sailed for his fleece\u2014",
    "a voice comes out of the dead water.",
    "In great Sophia",
    "light pours in rosy bars",
    "on the porphyry and the green marble",
    "till the air blooms,",
    "and a chrysalis of lit crosses",
    "makes circles in the air.",
    "Light falls through the lunettes",
    "like arrows of gold that could\u2019ve",
    "sneaked up the Virgin\u2019s dress.",
    "Had the Holy Ghost flitted in",
    "it would\u2019ve been lost in the glare",
    "and the kiss of peace",
    "Justinian blew from the ambo.",
    "*",
    "Incantations flutter and rhyme",
    "in the apse like wings",
    "in a cloud of incense",
    "thinning on the gold-leafed",
    "vaults where the tongue\u2019s vibration",
    "lingers in the upper air,",
    "and rises and rises as if the dome could open",
    "to a half-hemisphere of heaven",
    "where in the translucent glitter of the Kingdom",
    "the Saints are poised in gracious robes",
    "with their thousand-year-frozen faces\u2014",
    "the one truth glued on the grout of their lips.",
    "2",
    "I sit with the incense of memory,",
    "and a bath of dark pours",
    "from the vaults above the pew",
    "Outside, boutiques of money collide",
    "with the street fires in Harlem, whole",
    "skyscrapers are levitated by arbitrage,",
    "and the only inside takeover I can negotiate",
    "is myself in this pew with my herringbone jacket",
    "which I should chuck in the Salvation Army bin",
    "down the block, so I could join the line of choir-",
    "boys in their last innocent ritual",
    "as they stand before the mounted sermon sign",
    "\u201che shall bring forth judgment unto truth\u201d",
    "(Isaiah 42:3). The Puritans because",
    "they believed God\u2019s altar needs not their polish",
    "lifted the boulder of truth higher than the glittering",
    "face of the Nazarene once leaded in glass.",
    "For the spirit they swallowed stones",
    "and shattered all the panes. But beneath the lavender",
    "arch of a Canon Table in an old Gospel",
    "I once tasted the consubstantial dewdrop",
    "in the faded color of a peacock\u2019s wing.",
    "So while a stone sinks to the bottom of my",
    "river, a peacock\u2019s wing floats by the shore.",
    "Who tells it like it is: Isaiah or Procopius?",

    "I started walking backward",
    "down the aisle",
    "when I heard and thought I",
    "saw in the strange fenestration",
    "of that light\u2014",
    "a voice,",
    "first incoherent, and then sharp",
    "as if it were in my ear",
    "justice and judgment;",
    "is that why you whine?",
    "\u201cBut Primo Levi\u2019s image of a man\u2014",

    "of self-pity up its ass?",
    "And the raisin-light dribbling",
    "in the clerestory faded,",
    "and it was cold",

    "When the townspeople",
    "gave the teenaged Buddha",
    "a glass of wine",
    "so delicious he grew",
    "to an unthinkable size",
    "and froze into a blue statue",
    "that shielded the town",
    "from a wave that broke",
    "upon his back",
    "and would have swept away",
    "the town if he\u2019d not tasted",
    "the wine and afterward the people",
    "were overjoyed and said",
    "they would do good deeds",
    "like carpool their children to school",
    "more often and plant lettuce",
    "everywhere while the Buddha",
    "melted into water and receded",
    "into the calm sane sea."

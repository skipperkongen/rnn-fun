    "and morning stumbles in, stiff-jointed.",

    "until the moon begins",
    "its tiresome disappearing act,",

    "with a throb of weariness\u2014",
    "bud, bloom, leaf, fall.",
    "If it would help,",
    "I would paint my house silver",
    "or sell it or buy",
    "a red convertible.",
    "I would, but who am I",
    "to try to cheer up",
    "the self-indulgent universe."

    "I hate your hills white with dogwood",
    "or pink with redbud in spring",
    "as if you invented hope, as if",
    "in the middle of red clay,",
    "limestone outcroppings,",
    "and oak trees dead with fungus",
    "something slight and beautiful",
    "should make us smile.",
    "I hate the way honeysuckle drapes",
    "fences, blooms in the ditch",
    "where everyone dumps garbage;",
    "the evening air sweet with cedar",
    "and fields of burley;",
    "the way irises and buttercups",
    "mark the old dimensions of a house",
    "destroyed a hundred years ago;",
    "how a span of Queen Anne\u2019s lace",
    "rocks the whole moon, and the sumac",
    "runs dark against the hill.",
    "I hate the drawl, the lazy voice",
    "saying I\u2019ve been away so long",
    "I sound like I\u2019m from nowhere;",
    "the old hand gathering snowballs or peonies",
    "or forking up an extra dish of greens,",
    "bitter, just the way I like them."

    "I",
    "Beneath one apple tree the fruit",
    "lies flung like the beads from",
    "a rosary with a broken string.",
    "Another tree stands amused",
    "over the strangeness of a shoe",
    "that pretends to be an apple",
    "in its redness, though it'll never be",
    "an apple with that lace stem",
    "and a pit where a core should be.",
    "The tree at the end of the row",
    "will weep over the pillage",
    "all week. Around its trunk, debris:",
    "straw hats, handkerchief, a basket",
    "going hungry for what's out",
    "of reach. Somewhere in the orchard",
    "a screech goes weaker by the hour.",
    "A radio without paws, it cannot claw",
    "its chords to end its suffering.",
    "But silence comes, eventually,",
    "and the apple trees will rest,",
    "gathering the shadows to their roots",
    "as the flame inside each apple",
    "falls asleep. All the while, finches",
    "perch among the branches\u2014patient",
    "vultures waiting for the fruit to rot.",
    "For a wasp, intoxicated by the sugars,",
    "this is the perfect place to nest.",
    "The colony will thrive inside",
    "decay: the apples softening until",
    "their wrinkled skins begin to sink,",
    "the seeds poking through like teeth.",
    "The trees will sway without the wind",
    "because the ground will boil",
    "with larvae. A bird will feast",
    "until it chokes and ants will march",
    "into the belly through the beak.",
    "II",
    "A strand of hair pretends to be",
    "a crack and sticks to glass. A piece",
    "of thread sits on a seat, pretends",
    "to be a tear. The bus makes believe",
    "no one cried into their hands and smeared",
    "that grief onto its walls. The walls",
    "will keep the fingerprints a secret",
    "until the sheen of oils glows by moon.",
    "Rows of ghosts come forth to sing.",
    "Until that keening rocks the bus",
    "to rest, the fumes intoxicate",
    "the solitary button\u2014single witness",
    "to the shuffling of feet and a final act",
    "of fury: the yanking of a wetback's",
    "shirt. The button popped right off",
    "the flannel, marched in the procession",
    "and then scurried to the side. The lesson:",
    "if wounded, stay behind to die.",
    "The bus breathes out the shapes",
    "turned silhouettes turned scent",
    "of salt and sweat. The steering wheel",
    "unspools, every window shaking loose",
    "the wetness of its glare. And now",
    "a riddle squats over the parking lot:",
    "What creature stands its ground",
    "after evisceration? Roadkill. Clouds",
    "close in to consume the afterbirth.",
    "III",
    "A mausoleum also keeps these gems:",
    "precipitation that hardens into diamonds",
    "on the cobweb stems, streams of urine",
    "that shimmer like streaks of gold.",
    "Lights coax out the coat of polish",
    "on the floor and what's solid softens",
    "into water stripped of ripples. Stilled",
    "and empty, a river that has shoved",
    "its pebbles down its throat.",
    "The cell holds out three drops of blood",
    "and will barter them for company,",
    "hungry for the smell of men again. Janitor,",
    "border guard or detainee, it's all the same",
    "musk of armpit, garlic breath, oils",
    "that bubble up from crack to tailbone,",
    "scent of semen from the foreskin,",
    "fungus from the toes. Without takers,",
    "the keyhole constricts in the cold.",
    "IV",
    "A red-tailed hawk breaks through",
    "the smoke and doesn't drop the way",
    "the bodies did when the plane",
    "began to dive and spat pieces of its",
    "cargo out the door. No grace, the twitching",
    "of such a great machine. No beauty to",
    "its blackening inside the pristine",
    "canvas of majestic blue\u2014a streak of rage",
    "made by a torch and not a paintbrush.",
    "The hawk lands on the canyon",
    "and snaps its neck in quick response",
    "to the vulgar cracking on the boulders,",
    "to the shrill of metal puncturing",
    "the canyon, to the burst of flames",
    "that traps a nest of mice within the lair",
    "turned furnace, burning shriek, and hair.",
    "Stunned host of sparrows scatters.",
    "Fume of feathers, pollution in the air.",
    "Poison in the lungs of all that breathes.",
    "A darkness rises. The blue absorbs it",
    "the way it dissipates a swarm after",
    "the crisis of a shattered hive. Heaven",
    "shows its mercy also, swallowing",
    "the groan that spilled out of the hill.",
    "No signs of tragedy by dusk",
    "except a star splayed over rock,",
    "the reek of fumes\u2014a disemboweled god.",
    "V",
    "What strange flowers grow",
    "in the shadow. Without petals",
    "and with crooked twigs for stems.",
    "The butterflies that pollinated them",
    "were bits of carbon glowing",
    "at the edge. The solitary lone wolf",
    "spider doesn't dare to bite",
    "the scorched caul on the canyon.",
    "It packs its fangs for brighter lands.",
    "The footprints drawn in black",
    "do not match the footprints",
    "in the orchard though they also",
    "bear the weight of the unwanted.",
    "The chain gang called upon to gather",
    "the debris sang the Prison Blues",
    "all afternoon: Inmate, deportee,",
    "in your last attempt to flee",
    "every bone splits into three.",
    "VI",
    "Twenty-eight equals one",
    "deportation bus equals one",
    "cell in the detention center, one",
    "plane-load of deportees, one",
    "plunge into the canyon, one",
    "body in the coffin although one",
    "was a woman\u2014sister not alone",
    "anymore among the chaperone",
    "of angels with wings of stone.",
    "Manuel Merino, Julio Barr\u00f3n,",
    "Severo, El\u00edas, Manuel Calder\u00f3n,",
    "Francisco, Santiago, Jaime, Mart\u00edn,",
    "Lupe, Guadalupe, Tom\u00e1s, Juan Ruiz,",
    "Alberto, Ram\u00f3n, Apolonio, Ram\u00f3n,",
    "Luis, Rom\u00e1n, Luis, Salvador,",
    "Ignacio Navarro, Jes\u00fas, Bernab\u00e9,",
    "Rosal\u00edo Portillo, Mar\u00eda, y Jos\u00e9.",
    "Y un Deportado No Identificado.",
    "No papers necessary to cross",
    "the cemetery. The sun floods",
    "the paths between tombs",
    "and everything pushes out",
    "into light. No shame to be",
    "a cherub without a nose.",
    "The wreath will not hide",
    "its decay. Cement displays",
    "its injuries with no regrets.",
    "This is the place to forget",
    "about labor and hardship and pain.",
    "No house left to build, no kitchen",
    "to clean, no chair on a porch, no",
    "children to feed. No longing left",
    "except a wish that will never come",
    "true: Paint us back into the blank",
    "sky's blue. Don't forget us",
    "like we've forgotten all of you."

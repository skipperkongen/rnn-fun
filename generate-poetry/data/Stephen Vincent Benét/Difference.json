    "My mind\u2019s a map. A mad sea-captain drew it",
    "Under a flowing moon until he knew it;",
    "Winds with brass trumpets, puffy-cheeked as jugs,",
    "And states bright-patterned like Arabian rugs.",
    "\u201cHere there be tygers.\u201d \u201cHere we buried Jim.\u201d",
    "Here is the strait where eyeless fishes swim",
    "About their buried idol, drowned so cold",
    "He weeps away his eyes in salt and gold.",
    "A country like the dark side of the moon,",
    "A cider-apple country, harsh and boon,",
    "A country savage as a chestnut-rind,",
    "A land of hungry sorcerers.",
    "Your mind?",
    "\u2014Your mind is water through an April night,",
    "A cherry-branch, plume-feathery with its white,",
    "A lavender as fragrant as your words,",
    "A room where Peace and Honor talk like birds,",
    "Sewing bright coins upon the tragic cloth",
    "Of heavy Fate, and Mockery, like a moth,",
    "Flutters and beats about those lovely things.",
    "You are the soul, enchanted with its wings,",
    "The single voice that raises up the dead",
    "To shake the pride of angels.",
    "I have said."

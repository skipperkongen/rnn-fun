    "Fortune has brought me down\u2014her wonted way\u2014",
    "from station great and high to low estate;",
    "Fortune has rent away my plenteous store:",
    "of all my wealth honor alone is left.",
    "Fortune has turned my joy to tears: how oft",
    "did fortune make me laugh with what she gave!",
    "But for these girls, the kata\u2019s downy brood,",
    "unkindly thrust from door to door as hard\u2014",
    "Far would I roam and wide to seek my bread",
    "in earth that has no lack of breadth and length.",
    "Nay, but our children in our midst, what else",
    "but our hearts are they, walking on the ground?",
    "If but the breeze blow harsh on one of them",
    "my eye says no to slumber all night long."

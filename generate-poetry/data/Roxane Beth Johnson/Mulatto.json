    "Grandma is washing me white. I am the color of hot sand in the bleached sea light. I am a stain on the porcelain, persistent as tea. Stay in the shade. Don\u2019t say she was the only one. Cousins opposite say: you too white. I am a night-blooming flower being pried open in the morning. My skin a curtain for a cage of bones, a blackbird coop. My heart is crusty bread, hardening. Hardening. This way, I feed my own fluttering. Under shade, the day looks like evening and I cannot bear the darkness. Don\u2019t say, I can\u2019t stand to be touched. Say, I stare into the sun to burn off the soiled hands that print my body with bloody ink. Don\u2019t say,",
    ". Say, I am the horse in Oz turning different colors, each prance brightening flesh. A curiosity. Don\u2019t say, Bathwater spiraled down into the pipes. Say, I never did fade. Say, Skin holds the perseverance of my days. Folding, folding, the water continuously gathers, making wrinkles in a map."

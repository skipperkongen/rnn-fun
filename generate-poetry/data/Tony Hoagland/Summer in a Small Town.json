    "with all the self-acceptance of exhaustion,",
    "still dazed from their great outpouring,",
    "pushing their strollers along the public river walk.",
    "with its glassed-in bar and grill",
    "for the lunch-and-cocktail-seekers",
    "who come for the Mark Twain Happy Hour",
    "which lasts as long as the Mississippi.",

    "to let three wild turkeys cross the road,",
    "and when the high school music teacher retires",
    "after thirty years",
    "the movie marquee says, \u201cThanks Mr. Biddleman!\u201d",

    "with their clothes on,",

    "for which they have no words;",
    "obedient to the voice inside which tells them,",
    "\u201cNow. Steal Pleasure.\u201d"

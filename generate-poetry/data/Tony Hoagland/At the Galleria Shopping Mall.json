    "there are some",
    "one of them singing news about a far-off war,",
    "one comparing the breast size of an actress from Hollywood",
    "to the breast size of an actress from Bollywood.",
    "And here is my niece Lucinda,",
    "who is nine and a true daughter of Texas,",
    "who has developed the flounce of a pedigreed blonde",
    "and declares that her favorite sport is shopping.",
    "Today is the day she embarks upon her journey,",
    "swinging a credit card like a scythe",
    "through the meadows of golden merchandise.",
    "Today is the day she stops looking at faces,",
    "and starts assessing the labels of purses;",
    "So let it begin. Let her be dipped in the dazzling bounty",
    "and raised and wrung out again and again.",
    "And let us watch.",
    "As the gods in olden stories",
    "turned mortals into laurel trees and crows",
    "to teach them some kind of lesson,",
    "so we were turned into Americans",
    "to learn something about loneliness."

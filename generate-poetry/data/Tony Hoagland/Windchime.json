    "She goes out to hang the windchime",
    "in her nightie and her work boots.",
    "It\u2019s six-thirty in the morning",
    "and she\u2019s standing on the plastic ice chest",
    "tiptoe to reach the crossbeam of the porch,",

    "hammer in her right, the nail",
    "gripped tight between her teeth",
    "but nothing happens next because",
    "she\u2019s trying to figure out",
    "how to switch #1 with #3.",
    "She must have been standing in the kitchen,",
    "coffee in her hand, asleep,",

    "through the sound the windchime",
    "wasn\u2019t making",
    "because it wasn\u2019t there.",
    "No one, including me, especially anymore believes",
    "till death do us part,",
    "but I can see what I would miss in leaving\u2014",
    "the way her ankles go into the work boots",
    "as she stands upon the ice chest;",
    "the problem scrunched into her forehead;",
    "the little kissable mouth",
    "with the nail in it."

    "Then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud",
    "Says that America is for him a maximum-security prison",
    "Whose walls are made of RadioShacks and Burger Kings, and MTV episodes",
    "Where you can\u2019t tell the show from the commercials,",
    "And as I consider how to express how full of shit I think he is,",
    "He says that even when he\u2019s driving to the mall in his Isuzu",
    "Trooper with a gang of his friends, letting rap music pour over them",
    "Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers, even then he feels",
    "Buried alive, captured and suffocated in the folds",
    "Of the thick satin quilt of America",
    "And I wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain,",
    "or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade,",
    "And then I remember that when I stabbed my father in the dream last night,",
    "It was not blood but money",
    "That gushed out of him, bright green hundred-dollar bills",
    "Spilling from his wounds, and\u2014this is the weird part\u2014,",
    "He gasped \u201cThank god\u2014those Ben Franklins were",
    "Clogging up my heart\u2014",
    "And so I perish happily,",
    "Freed from that which kept me from my liberty\u201d\u2014",
    "Which was when I knew it was a dream, since my dad",
    "Would never speak in rhymed couplets,",
    "And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes",
    "And I think, \u201cI am asleep in America too,",
    "And I don\u2019t know how to wake myself either,\u201d",
    "And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life:",
    "\u201cI was listening to the cries of the past,",
    "When I should have been listening to the cries of the future.\u201d",
    "But how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable",
    "Or what kind of nightmare it might be",
    "When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you",
    "And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river",
    "Even while others are drowning underneath you",
    "And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters",
    "And yet it seems to be your own hand",
    "Which turns the volume higher?"

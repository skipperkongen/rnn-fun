    "There was the day we swam in a river, a lake, and an ocean.",
    "And the day I quit the job my father got me.",
    "And the day I stood outside a door,",
    "and listened to my girlfriend making love",
    "to someone obviously not me, inside,",
    "and I felt strange because I didn\u2019t care.",
    "There was the morning I was born,",
    "and the year I was a loser,",
    "and the night I was the winner of the prize",
    "for which the audience applauded.",
    "Then there was someone else I met,",
    "whose face and voice I can\u2019t forget,",
    "and the memory of her",
    "is like a jail I\u2019m trapped inside,",
    "or maybe she is something I just use",
    "to hold my real life at a distance.",
    "Joe says,",
    "plucked from a river of lava",
    "and held aloft on a tightrope",
    "strung between two scrawny trees",
    "above a canyon",
    "in a manic-depressive windstorm.",
    "Don\u2019t drop it, Don\u2019t drop it, Don\u2019t drop it\u2014,",
    "And when you do, you will keep looking for it",
    "everywhere, for years,",
    "while right behind you,",
    "the footprints you are leaving",
    "will look like notes",
    "of a crazy song."

    "There isn\u2019t a word for walking out of the grocery store",
    "with a gallon jug of milk in a plastic sack",
    "that should have been bagged in double layers",
    "\u2014so that before you are even out the door",
    "you feel the weight of the jug dragging",
    "the bag down, stretching the thin",
    "plastic handles longer and longer",
    "and you know it\u2019s only a matter of time until",
    "bottom suddenly splits.",
    "There is no single, unimpeachable word",
    "for that vague sensation of something",
    "moving away from you",
    "as it exceeds its elastic capacity",
    "\u2014which is too bad, because that is the word",
    "I would like to use to describe standing on the street",
    "chatting with an old friend",
    "as the awareness grows in me that he is",
    "no longer a friend, but only an acquaintance,",
    "a person with whom I never made the effort\u2014",
    "until this moment, when as we say goodbye",
    "I think we share a feeling of relief,",
    "a recognition that we have reached",
    "the end of a pretense,",
    "though to tell the truth",
    "what I already am thinking about",
    "is my gratitude for language\u2014",
    "how it will stretch just so much and no farther;",
    "how there are some holes it will not cover up;",
    "how it will move, if not inside, then",
    "around the circumference of almost anything\u2014",
    "how, over the years, it has given me",
    "back all the hours and days, all the",
    "plodding love and faith, all the",
    "misunderstandings and secrets",
    "I have willingly poured into it."

    "An evil spirit, your beauty, haunts me still,",
    "Wherewith, alas, I have been long possess'd,",
    "Which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill,",
    "Nor gives me once but one poor minute's rest.",
    "In me it speaks, whether I sleep or wake;",
    "And when by means to drive it out I try,",
    "With greater torments then it me doth take,",
    "And tortures me in most extremity.",
    "Before my face it lays down my despairs,",
    "And hastes me on unto a sudden death;",
    "Now tempting me to drown myself in tears,",
    "And then in sighing to give up my breath.",
    "Thus am I still provok'd to every evil",
    "By this good-wicked spirit, sweet angel-devil."

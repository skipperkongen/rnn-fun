    "As Love and I, late harbour\u2019d in one inn,",
    "With proverbs thus each other entertain:",

    "Fair words make fools, replieth he again;",
    "Who spares to speak, doth spare to speed (quoth I),",

    "Fortune assists the boldest, I reply,",
    "A hasty man (quoth he) ne\u2019er wanted woe;",
    "Labour is light, where love (quoth I) doth pay,",
    "(Saith he) light burthen\u2019s heavy, if far born;",
    "(Quoth I) the main lost, cast the bye away;",
    "You have spun a fair thread, he replies in scorn.",
    "And having thus awhile each other thwarted,",
    "Fools as we met, so fools again we parted."

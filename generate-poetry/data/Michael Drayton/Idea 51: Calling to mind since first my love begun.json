    "Calling to mind since first my love begun,",
    "Th' incertain times oft varying in their course,",
    "How things still unexpectedly have run,",
    "As t' please the fates by their resistless force:",
    "Lastly, mine eyes amazedly have seen",
    "Essex' great fall, Tyrone his peace to gain,",
    "The quiet end of that long-living Queen,",
    "This King's fair entrance, and our peace with Spain,",
    "We and the Dutch at length ourselves to sever:",
    "Thus the world doth and evermore shall reel.",
    "Yet to my goddess am I constant ever,",
    "Howe'er blind fortune turn her giddy wheel:",
    "Though heaven and earth prove both to me untrue,",
    "Yet am I still inviolate to you."

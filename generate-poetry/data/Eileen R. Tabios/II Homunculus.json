    "The political contributions of whatever he creates are coincidental",
    "and, in any event, irrelevant. The musician may not be relying on",
    "mathematical acoustics in his calculations. He may be performing",
    "for auditoriums; thus, his physical realities change as he travels. Music",
    "seems inevitable. Every question entails some notion of what is being asked.",
    "The motley nature is not alien. Certain sounds guide the vulgar mind",
    "to notions not anticipated by those creating the sounds. A bartender",
    "concocts an Absolut Citroen gimlet, ice-cold but no ice, with one hand;",
    "\u201cwith the other hand he gathers up gonorrhea.\u201d Most of what is imparted",
    "is not verbal. Certain philosophers must be translated before their audiences",
    "can respond. The mind is made visible through unconscious functions.",
    "The academic is always searching for the plumber. He is faithful to innocence.",
    "Order is space and space is order. Order is space and space is order.",
    "After being disaffected with Impressionism, Renoir felt he had to learn to draw",
    "and paint all over again. In Germany, an aesthetic movement became political",
    "and was forced to renounce art without realizing a decision had been made.",
    "A philosopher did not realize that the man who expelled poetry from",
    "well-ordered republics used to tremble at the thought of doing so,",
    "thereby creating through that very act a sublime poetry."

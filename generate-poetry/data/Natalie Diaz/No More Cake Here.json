    "When my brother died",
    "I worried there wasn\u2019t enough time",
    "to deliver the one hundred invitations",
    "I\u2019d scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary:",
    "Unfortunately the firemen couldn\u2019t come.",
    "(I had hoped they\u2019d give free rides on the truck.)",
    "They did agree to drive by the house once",
    "with the lights on\u2014 It was a party after all.",
    "I put Mom and Dad in charge of balloons,",
    "let them blow as many years of my brother\u2019s name,",
    "jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls,",
    "fistfights, and",
    "visits as they could let go of.",
    "The scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling",
    "like they\u2019d been filled with helium. Mom blew up",
    "so many that she fell asleep. She slept for ten years\u2014",
    "she missed the whole party.",
    "My brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding",
    "his stained T-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up",
    "into the air like confetti.",
    "When the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out",
    "the front door. They seemed to know where",
    "they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins",
    "at the end of our cul-de-sac. The clowns played toy bugles",
    "until the air was scented with rotten raspberries.",
    "They pulled scarves from Mom\u2019s ear\u2014she slept through it.",
    "I baked my brother\u2019s favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting).",
    "When I counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen.",
    "We all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.",
    "A few stray dogs came to the window.",
    "I heard their stomachs and mouths growling",
    "over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom.",
    "(There was no room in the hallway because of the magician.)",
    "The mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics.",
    "I told the dogs,",
    ", and shut the window.",
    "The fire truck came by with the sirens on. The dogs ran away.",
    "I sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.",
    "I wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house,",
    "taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them\u2014",
    "remote controls, the Polaroid, stereo, Shop-Vac,",
    "even the motor to Dad\u2019s work truck\u2014everything",
    "my brother had taken apart and put back together",
    "doing his crystal meth tricks\u2014he\u2019d always been",
    "a magician of sorts.",
    "Two mutants came to the door.",
    "One looked almost human. They wanted",
    "to know if my brother had willed them the pots",
    "and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom.",
    "They said they missed my brother\u2019s cooking and did we",
    "have any cake.",
    ", I told them.",
    "they asked. I told them",
    "God was and they ran into the desert, barefoot.",
    "I gave Dad his slice and put Mom\u2019s in the freezer.",
    "I brought up the pots and pans and spoons",
    "(really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them",
    "together like a New Year\u2019s Day celebration.",
    "My brother finally showed up asking why",
    "he hadn\u2019t been invited and who baked the cake.",
    "He told me I shouldn\u2019t smile, that this whole party was shit",
    "because I\u2019d imagined it all. The worst part he said was",
    "he was still alive. The worst part he said was",
    "he wasn\u2019t even dead. I think he\u2019s right, but maybe",
    "the worst part is that I\u2019m still imagining the party, maybe",
    "the worst part is that I can still taste the cake."

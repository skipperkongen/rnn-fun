    "I like it quiet like this, Alton. I like",
    "to think. I love the way spring light falls",
    "easy, soft. This morning I was driving",
    "the cruiser, savoring gold pollen everywhere",
    "out in the south of the county. Real nice,",
    "seeing forsythia and daffodils, ditch irises,",
    "and a few Cherokee roses opening white.",
    "It was a blue day, and I had a Tampa Jewel,",
    "just counting cows, seeing an April breeze",
    "in the catkins and new leaves, the radio off.",
    "I know that\u2019s hardly right, but curse",
    "any citizen who\u2019d grudge me an hour\u2019s peace.",
    "Then I started seeing this marksmanship",
    "in the caution signs, the yellow diamonds",
    "that warn of deer or curves ahead, a steep",
    "grade\u0097there\u2019s one of those. Four circles",
    "and a jagged hole, likely a thirty-eight",
    "slug, smack in the center neater than Willard",
    "cleaves meat at the joint. A dozen and more.",
    "I got mad because I get paid to protect",
    "what the county commission declares holy\u0097",
    "the park with its petting zoo, the rebel",
    "sentry on the square, and all the highway signs\u0097",
    "and here\u2019s all indications that some felon",
    "has no respect, some felon who can shoot.",
    "I admit my feelings were mixed, that right",
    "indignation at the broken law, but envy",
    "of his eye for centers. Mind you, I saw nary",
    "a rip on the fringes or a near miss. Bull\u2019s-eyes,",
    "every sign I saw. A fool is what I feel, you",
    "understand, cause I motored over to Pig Burton\u2019s",
    "store near The Bottle and asked him\u0097he was",
    "stacking feed sacks on Robert Ring\u2019s vehicle\u0097",
    "who the hell was the target king of Beat Three.",
    "Pig always has his hands in every pie; he\u2019d",
    "know if some individual had been hauling off all",
    "the turkey shoot prizes. I know I should know,",
    "too, but a sheriff\u2019s got beaucoup chores",
    "to do, mostly idiot paperwork. I\u2019ve lost",
    "touch since the last bond vote hired me four new",
    "deputies, all dirt-dumb. Well, old Pig has",
    "that laugh he can\u2019t hold back, and he points",
    "his finger pistol-like at Robert, who\u2019s got",
    "a shamed look on his face. \u201cPow,\u201d he says",
    "at me or Bob, looking back and forth, just",
    "\u201cPow.\u201d Seems Bob\u2019s boy Earl, the one",
    "that ain\u2019t got the sense of a chicken under",
    "that cowlick red as a rooster comb, is known",
    "to have sneaked Bob\u2019s Colt a week before",
    "and shot every yellow sign he could till his pa",
    "ran him down and whacked him good,",
    "then locked him in the fall-down curing shed",
    "overnight\u0097he\u2019s a hard man, but he loves",
    "that boy. I remember once ... but how the hell",
    "can any half-wit you wouldn\u2019t trust to milk",
    "hit the bull by the eye first time he ever gets",
    "loose with a handgun? \u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d says Bob,",
    "less shamed than afraid now he\u2019ll have to pay",
    "for fresh metal\u0097his people have always",
    "been tight\u0097but he\u2019s showing a grin I don\u2019t like.",
    "\u201cReal easy. He just cuts loose from the hip,",
    "five short feet back, sometimes maybe six,",
    "and comes back later to paint the target circles",
    "wheresomever his bullet hits. He aims that",
    "paintbrush right smart.\u201d Blessed if I don\u2019t",
    "feel the fool for being full dumbstruck",
    "at a trick Earl\u2019s not bright enough to see",
    "as a joke. But I didn\u2019t write it up nor charge",
    "a soul, just ground my cigar in the dirt",
    "and helped myself to a Dr. Pepper, made believe",
    "it didn\u2019t mean a thing, but all day I\u2019ve been",
    "riding, listening to crime reports on state radio\u0097",
    "robbery at the mall, attempted rape maybe, wrecks",
    "on the bypass and a set fire in Brill\u2019s deer woods.",
    "It gets to be too much. I shouldn\u2019t even take",
    "the time to sit here watching this dark space",
    "where folks have been dancing all evening,",
    "hearing the quiet after all those raucous songs,",
    "but Alton, don\u2019t you see, the feeble boy\u2019s right,",
    "or half right, at least? It all comes to the same,",
    "whether you get what you want in the end or",
    "want what you get. The law works that way:",
    "each law makes more crime, but it\u2019s not my job",
    "to say. Warm up my cup just one last time.",
    "I\u2019ve got to circle Ampex once more before",
    "I turn it home. God, this dark feels right,",
    "no matter what flowers out there shed spring",
    "light. The dark is what hits me as holy.",
    "I\u2019m calling it a day. Catch you later. Night."

    "I\u2019ve caught fish everwhichaway they can be.",
    "On the Chattahoochee River I\u2019ve used nets, gigs,",
    "trot lines, and bare hands. Even electricity.",
    "One day Braleigh and me caught so many",
    "that two-ended punt boat nearly went under.",
    "We were boys and didn\u2019t know any better.",
    "Catfish were plentiful as water for all",
    "we could figure. That was back then.",
    "We\u2019d wrap the copper pipe and drop it in,",
    "then use the telephone battery to make a wet cell",
    "of that whole muddy dogleg of the river.",
    "The small channel cats would rise, then",
    "recover, but big whites and blues would float,",
    "belly up, and we\u2019d haul \u2019em in, fill the boat",
    "to the oarlocks with fresh fish to eat or sell.",
    "Their backs shined so bright it was a wonder.",
    "But let me tell you this: it was also a danger.",
    "If you caught the coil wrong or touched iron",
    "binding on that old craft with a live wire,",
    "it was enough to knock you on your ass.",
    "A man could get killed just trying to catch fish.",
    "Of course, such a method was a sin against Jesus",
    "and man, fish and fresh water, but we didn\u2019t savvy.",
    "We were just free as gnats for the summer,",
    "a little enterprising and a little hungry.",
    "Besides, we hadn\u2019t heard of sport or mercy.",
    "That was a cooter\u2019s age ago. That was then."

    "Surprised by a frill of white flower",
    "where I'd never planted an eye,",
    "I decided to fence it with sticks",
    "and let the renegade live",
    "in undoctored soil where the garden",
    "gave way to volunteer poplars",
    "and acidic white pine. Why not?",
    "After all, away from the tribe,",
    "in clay where beetles drill",
    "and weeds emerge inspired,",
    "it might grow eccentric, proliferate",
    "and thrive.",
    "When autumn air",
    "said",
    ", to fill the bin",
    "for winter, I troweled under",
    "and pulled the stem",
    "until a rabble of rough spuds",
    "red as Etruscan urns emerged",
    "as if to prove",
    "that whatever urge drove",
    "the rogue to sow itself and strive",
    "beyond all cultivation",
    "might offer a vital lesson",
    "to any apostate instinct",
    "aspiring to survive."

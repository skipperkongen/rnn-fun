    "by the other. Strange",
    "and estranged pairings give rise to mutable truth",
    "that can yield to both dawn and twilight",
    "demands that things be seen differently.",
    "Jennifer in moonlight instead of being illuminated moon whose face",
    "was also in Emmett Till\u2019s way, but this generation of Jennifer has another side",
    "home late after a day of good faith",
    "in which she and Cotton team up",
    "at a church to speak up about doubt",
    "as less a shadow than certainty.",

    "that always fits something, that like the purest",
    "most sparkling water is too na\u00efve",
    "not to submit",
    "to any vessel into which it\u2019s poured.",
    "Just to be guzzled.",
    "Perhaps the vessel in which cotton",
    "becomes a pool",
    "in which North Carolina is shaped",
    "like an embryo:",
    "Humanity still on the brink",
    "of infancy."

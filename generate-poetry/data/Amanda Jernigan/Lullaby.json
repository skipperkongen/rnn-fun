    "My little lack-of-light, my swaddled soul,",
    "December baby. Hush, for it is dark,",
    "and will grow darker still. We must embark",
    "directly. Bring an orange as the toll",
    "for Charon: he will be our gondolier.",
    "Upon the shore, the season pans for light,",
    "and solstice fish, their eyes gone milky white,",
    "come bearing riches for the dying year:",
    "solstitial kingdom. It is yours, the mime",
    "of branches and the drift of snow. With shaking",
    "hands, Persephone, the winter\u2019s wife,",
    "will tender you a gift. Born in a time",
    "of darkness, you will learn the trick of making.",
    "You shall make your consolation all your life."

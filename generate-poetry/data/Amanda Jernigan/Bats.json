    "They billow from a hillside in Cha\u2019am.",
    "Together, they are more than plural:",
    "the planet\u2019s darkest song, a tongue,",
    "a serpent muscling air apart,",
    "a dire banner come unfurled,",
    "a river flowing wholly from",
    "the old, mute mountain\u2019s desperate heart,",
    "the last confession of the world.",
    "Conceive of each one singly, if you can."

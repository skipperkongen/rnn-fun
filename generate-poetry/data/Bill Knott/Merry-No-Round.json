    "The wooden horses",
    "are tired of their courses",
    "and plead from head to hoof",
    "to be fed to a stove\u0097",
    "In leaping lunging flames",
    "they\u2019d rise again, flared manes",
    "snapping like chains behind them.",
    "The smoke would not blind them",
    "as do these children\u2019s hands:",
    "beyond our cruel commands",
    "the fire will free them then",
    "as once the artisan when",
    "out of the tree they",
    "were nagged to this neigh."

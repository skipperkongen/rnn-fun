    "Despite it all, something stirs at the sight",
    "Of the cool, enameled body,",
    "The unreflecting eye,",
    "And the long jaw like a chisel",
    "With its single, violent purpose.",
    "It hangs dead still at the water's surface",
    "And seems lifeless, until",
    "A flickering gesture",
    "Carves fish after fish",
    "From any school that swims too close",
    "And creates in the world a new absence,",
    "As if this might be the shaper",
    "As well as the defacer",
    "Of the damaged masterpiece",
    "Whose headless body hails the bodies",
    "Of the many Egyptians excised at Cyprus."

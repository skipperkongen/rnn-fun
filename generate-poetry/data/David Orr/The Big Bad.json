    "At last we decoded the terminal message,",
    "Only to find the pattern we had expected",
    "Was false \u2014 a false trail of false bread crumbs",
    "Designed to leave pitfalls undetected.",
    "We found a new pattern. We found a hand",
    "Moving pieces we had thought were only",
    "Part of the board, and shifting them to vantage points",
    "We had ignored. We rewrote the battle plan",
    "And reconfigured the satellite array",
    "To show our progress from the very beginning.",
    "The fault should be traceable \u2014 and hence correctable \u2014",
    "And once we found it, we\u2019d be winning.",
    "We found a new pattern. We followed its track",
    "To a forest beside an abandoned tunnel",
    "Diving wide as a boxcar into the rock.",
    "A stale breeze blew over rusting shovels",
    "And all of our instruments confirmed a hit.",
    "We set a perimeter. We sent in a scout.",
    "From the interior, nothing looked back at us.",
    "No tracks indicated a force had come out.",
    "But we had a pattern. At dawn, we dispatched",
    "A team of our best, our trackers and stone killers,",
    "To see if the signals were finally a match",
    "And if so, to counterattack. And now we wait.",
    "And now we wait. The tunnel gives nothing back.",
    "The trees are revealing the first signs of gold",
    "But the air is unmoving. The air is still.",
    "It is quiet here, and getting cold."

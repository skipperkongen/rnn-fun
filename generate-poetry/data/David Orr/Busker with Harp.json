    "The fact of the harp swells into the air,",
    "Alien and familiar and entirely too large,",
    "An elephant lost in the suburbs,",
    "And opens with its cry a strange passage",
    "Between the harp itself, the fragile harp,",
    "And the almost guilty knowledge",
    "Of the stroke of luck that brought it here",
    "And the care with which it must depart."

    "Someone had spread an elaborate rumor about me, that I was",
    "in possession of an extraterrestrial being, and I thought I knew who",
    "it was. It was Roger Lawson. Roger was a practical joker of the",
    "worst sort, and up till now I had not been one of his victims, so",
    "I kind of knew my time had come. People parked in front of my",
    "house for hours and took pictures. I had to draw all my blinds",
    "and only went out when I had to. Then there was a barrage of",
    "questions. \u201cWhat does he look like?\" \u201cWhat do you feed him?\u201d \u201cHow",
    "did you capture him?\u201d And I simply denied the presence of an",
    "extraterrestrial in my house. And, of course, this excited them",
    "all the more. The press showed up and started creeping around",
    "my yard. It got to be very irritating. More and more came and",
    "parked up and down the street. Roger was really working overtime",
    "on this one. I had to do something. Finally, I made an announcement.",
    "I said, \u201cThe little fellow died peacefully in his sleep at 11:02",
    "last night.\u201d \u201cLet us see the body,\u201d they clamored. \u201cHe went up",
    "in smoke instantly,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d one of them",
    "said. \u201cThere is no body in the house or I would have buried it",
    "myself,\u201d I said. About half of them got in their cars and drove",
    "off. The rest of them kept their vigil, but more solemnly now.",
    "I went out and bought some groceries. When I came back about an",
    "hour later another half of them had gone. When I went into the kitchen",
    "I nearly dropped the groceries. There was a nearly transparent",
    "fellow with large pink eyes standing about three feet tall. \u201cWhy",
    "did you tell them I was dead? That was a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou",
    "speak English,\u201d I said. \u201cI listen to the radio. It wasn\u2019t very",
    "hard to learn. Also we have television. We get all your channels.",
    "I like cowboys, especially John Ford movies. They\u2019re the best,\u201d",
    "he said. \u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d I said. \u201cTake me",
    "to meet a real cowboy. That would make me happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI",
    "don\u2019t know any real cowboys, but maybe we could find one. But",
    "people will go crazy if they see you. We\u2019d have press following",
    "us everywhere. It would be the story of the century,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI can be invisible. It\u2019s not hard for me to do,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Wyoming or Montana would be our best bet, but",
    "they\u2019re a long way from here,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease, I won\u2019t cause",
    "you any trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would take some planning,\u201d I said.",
    "I put the groceries down and started putting them away. I tried",
    "not to think of the cosmic meaning of all this. Instead, I",
    "treated him like a smart little kid. \u201cDo you have any sarsaparilla?\u201d",
    "he said. \u201cNo, but I have some orange juice. It\u2019s good for you,\u201d",
    "I said. He drank it and made a face. \u201cI\u2019m going to get the maps",
    "out,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how we could get there.\u201d When I came",
    "back he was dancing on the kitchen table, a sort of ballet, but",
    "very sad. \u201cI have the maps,\u201d I said. \u201cWe won\u2019t need them. I just",
    "received word. I\u2019m going to die tonight. It\u2019s really a joyous",
    "occasion, and I hope you\u2019ll help me celebrate by watching",
    ",\u201d he said. I stood there with the maps in my",
    "hand. I felt an unbearable sadness come over me. \u201cWhy must",
    "you die?\u201d I said. \u201cFather decides these things. It is probably",
    "my reward for coming here safely and meeting you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut",
    "I was going to take you to meet a real cowboy,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s",
    "pretend you are my cowboy,\u201d he said."

    "O sleepy city of reeling wheelchairs",
    "where a mouse can commit suicide if he can",
    "concentrate long enough",
    "on the history book of rodents",
    "in this underground town",
    "of electrical wheelchairs!",
    "The girl who is always pregnant and bruised",
    "like a pear",
    "rides her many-stickered bicycle",
    "backward up the staircase",
    "of the abandoned trolleybarn.",
    "Yesterday was warm. Today a butterfly froze",
    "in midair; and was plucked like a grape",
    "by a child who swore he could take care",
    "of it. O confident city where",
    "the seeds of poppies pass for carfare,",
    "where the ordinary hornets in a human\u2019s heart",
    "may slumber and snore, where bifocals bulge",
    "in an orange garage of daydreams,",
    "we wait in our loose attics for a new season",
    "as if for an ice-cream truck.",
    "An Indian pony crosses the plains",
    "whispering Sanskrit prayers to a crater of fleas.",
    "Honeysuckle says: I thought I could swim.",
    "The Mayor is urinating on the wrong side",
    "of the street! A dandelion sends off sparks:",
    "beware your hair is locked!",
    "Beware the trumpet wants a glass of water!",
    "Beware a velvet tabernacle!",
    "Beware the Warden of Light has married",
    "an old piece of string!"

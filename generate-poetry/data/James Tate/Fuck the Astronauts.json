    "I",
    "Eventually we must combine nightmares",
    "an angel smoking a cigarette on the steps",
    "of the last national bank, said to me.",

    "cheap talk I\u2019ve got my own angel",
    "on the steps of the problems the bank",
    "said to me I don\u2019t need that.",
    "I will take this one window",
    "with its sooty maps and scratches",

    "one another and so that my eyes will not",
    "become blinded by the new world.",

    "They have painted the room green.",
    "Beautiful and naked, the wives",
    "are sleeping before the fire.",
    "Now it is out. The men have",

    "slaved creatures from the forest",
    "floor across their white",
    "stationwagons. That just about",

    "over her head. Well, I guess",
    "we got everything, says one,",

    "and sit sucking eggs all night,",
    "they want something real, useful,",
    "but there isn\u2019t anything.",
    "III",
    "I will engineer the sunrise",
    "they have disassembled our shadows",
    "our echoes are erased from the walls",

    "your nipples blow away like cigarette papers",
    "your nipples are the mouths of mutes",
    "so I am not here any longer",
    "skein of lightning",
    "memory\u2019s dark ink in your last smile",
    "where the stars have swallowed their train schedule",

    "like a sock of hamburger",
    "receiving the lightning",
    "into his clitoris",
    "red on red the prisoner",
    "confesses his waltz",
    "through the corkscrew lightning",
    "nevermind the lightning",
    "in your teeth let\u2019s waltz",
    "I am the hashish pinball machine",
    "that rapes a piano."

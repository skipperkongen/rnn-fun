    "All the sexually active people in Westport",

    "waiting calm as you please. Perhaps it is",
    "my brain that is unplugged, and these",
    "shadow-people don\u2019t know how to drink",
    "martinis anymore. They are suddenly and",
    "mysteriously not in the least interested",
    "in fornicating with strangers. Well,",

    "here, and certainly no dinner invitations",
    "where a fella could probe Buffy\u2018s inner-",
    "mush, a really complicated adventure,",
    "in a 1930ish train station, outlandish",
    "bouquets, a poisonous insect found",
    "burrowing its way through the walls",
    "of the special restaurant and into one",
    "of her perfect nostrils\u0097she was reading",

    "all so ephemeral ...\u201d But now, in Westport",
    "Connecticut, a boy, a young man really,",

    "a carwash, and dressed for the kind of success",
    "that made her girlfriends froth and lather,",

    "and we are whirling in a spangled frenzy toward",
    "a riddle and a doom\u0097here\u2019s looking up",
    "your old address."

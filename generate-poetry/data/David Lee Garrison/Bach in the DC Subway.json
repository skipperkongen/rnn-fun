    "As an experiment,",
    "asked a concert violinist\u2014",
    "wearing jeans, tennis shoes,",
    "and a baseball cap\u2014",

    "at rush hour in the subway",
    "and play Bach",
    "on a Stradivarius.",
    "called out to commuters",
    "like an ocean to waves,",
    "sang to the station",
    "about why we should bother",
    "to live.",
    "A thousand people",
    "streamed by. Seven of them",

    "over to the open door",
    "each time she was free",
    "said later that Bach",
    "gave her peace,",
    "and all the children,",
    "all of them,",
    "waded into the music",
    "as if it were water,",
    "listening until they had to be",
    "rescued by parents",
    "who had somewhere else to go."

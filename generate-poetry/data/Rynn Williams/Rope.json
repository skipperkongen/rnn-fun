    "The girl\u2019s father laughs a little too hard",
    "when I say:",
    "\u2019",
    "as his daughter whips the dime store jump rope",
    "over her head for the twelve thousandth time\u2014",
    "laughs as if I\u2019m joking, when really, she has it down\u2014",
    "sparkly pink handles grimy with effort,",
    "her face obscured by her hair, shins thin and bruised,",
    "socks down at the ankles. Abandoned",
    "by the rest of the crowd, the concrete square",
    "an archipelago, an alignment with rigor the others",
    "cannot fathom, she moves with fierce persistence",
    "into afternoon, the heft of the handles, smack of the rope\u2014",
    "no Double Dutch, limbo, no communal game,",
    "but this resolute definition of rhythm,",
    "slatted bench shadows lengthening into space,",
    "the other kids simply forgetting she\u2019s there,",
    "her solitary corner of the playground darkening",
    "as the dinner hour approaches, while pigeons pause",
    "on their branches, squirrels come down the trunk and stop,",
    "with rush hour beyond the fence, cars idling,",
    "and the rope\u2019s metronome, forgotten as breath,",
    "weaving all the disparate energies of girl\u2014",
    "elation, fury, eagerness, song\u2014",
    "into one singular strand."

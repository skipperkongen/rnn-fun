    "1. READING THE RESULTS",
    "I don\u2019t move,",
    "but the inside corner",
    "of my right eye turns glassy,",
    "then shatters,",
    "hands focus more sharply.",
    "I don\u2019t move,",
    "but the pigeon shudders",
    "on the sill.",
    "The door opens to a maze",
    "of wallpaper, family photos\u2014",
    "their bliss-frieze burns",
    "the last unaffected corner of my sight,",
    "like molten Karo.",
    "My husband\u2019s mouth collapses,",
    "and the air about his shoulders",
    "has crystallized.",
    "We don\u2019t say a word,",
    "all the noise is around us,",
    "the letter, half-folded, on the desk,",
    "an albatross, a dove.",
    "2. POSITIVE",
    "Because in those days there were no words",
    "for such things I took handfuls of vitamins and slept",
    "with a trumpet flower under my pillow, I ate",
    "at the Kiev on Second Avenue at four every morning:",
    "enormous boiled potato pierogis shivering in pools",
    "of butter, little sides of saut\u00e9ed onions, paper cups of pure",
    "sour cream, Dr. Brown\u2019s Cel-Ray, no ice, as chaser,",
    "but now when the call comes I\u2019m sitting in the kitchen",
    "with two plastic funnels over my breasts and the pump",
    "on the coutner with its hydraulic suck and the cast iron",
    "sputtering of eggs, the kids already bickering at table,",
    "milk flowing into baby bottles, even now the word",
    "heroin makes me feel the lovely way",
    "a body can go slack from inside out.",
    "3. A SINGLE DROP",
    "I\u2019d never paid much mind",
    "to my implements, but now",
    "I paint \u201cFire Engine Red\u201d",
    "on the handle of my razor, a single drop",
    "on my nail clippers, one long",
    "stroke on my lethal toothbrush",
    "to cordon off my blood,",
    "I tend and sop each splash or seep,",
    "soiled band-aids, love-smeared sheets\u2014",
    "every bleeding gum, torn hangnail,",
    "paper cut, scrape, gully of cracked lip",
    "another hazard, each",
    "infectious throb now",
    "forever watched as I patrol",
    "my body\u2019s raging arroyo",
    "in the family bathroom,",
    "to keep my children",
    "safe from me.",
    "4. PAPER GOWNS",
    "X-rays, lab coat, and me wearing",
    "those delicate petals (gaping,",
    "cold through the sleeves).",
    "He asks me to extend my palms:",
    "the motion is of pushing away.",
    ", he says, soft",
    "tup, tup, tup, along my spine,",
    "as if checking a cantaloupe.",
    "There is a piece of gum",
    "beneath the windowsill,",
    "green imprint of a thumb.",
    "We\u2019re talking percentages, genotypes,",
    "we\u2019re talking bundled pharmaceuticals.",
    "Studies, it seems, are inconclusive.",
    "I try to look at the big picture:",
    "a talc-free rubber glove at the edge of the trash,",
    "neither in, nor out. On the insurance card,",
    "raised numbers, black ink worn away.",
    "There's a girl on the street with her head back,",
    "the strap of her dress falling carelessly."

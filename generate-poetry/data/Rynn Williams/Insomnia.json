    "I try tearing paper into tiny, perfect squares\u2014",
    "they cut my fingers. Warm milk, perhaps,",
    "stirred counter-clockwise in a cast iron pan\u2014",
    "but even then there\u2019s burning at the edges,",
    "angry foam-hiss. I\u2019ve been told",
    "to put trumpet flowers under my pillow,",
    "I do: stamen up, the old crone said.",
    "But the pollen stains, and there are bees,",
    "I swear, in those long yellow chambers, echoing,",
    "the way the house does, mocking, with its longevity\u2014",
    "each rib creaking and bending where I\u2019m likely to break\u2014",

    "to where it flattens to",
    ", and just stay there",
    "disconnecting the dots of my night sky",
    "as one would take apart a house made of sticks,",
    "carefully, last addition to first,",
    "like sheep leaping backward into their pens."

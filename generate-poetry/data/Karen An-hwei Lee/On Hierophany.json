    "fleshliness of the ordinary. Or the sacred and profane",
    "is another way to say this. I asked whether it is a hernia,",
    "and the answer was no. A herniated condition is viscera",
    "on viscera \u2014 a disc, organs, the skin, or nerves. Besides,",
    "such a comparison would be profane. A figure of speech",
    "already exists, I said, in a hieratic silence of cursive",
    "writing long ago dead. Not long ago, those two phrases",
    "dwelled in separate worlds. I dare you to use the word",
    "in a poem, said a friend. So I not only used",
    "the word, I invited God into language. Or God existed",

    "the converse is not always true \u2014 not all hierophanies",
    "are theophanies \u2014 or God visible in our world."

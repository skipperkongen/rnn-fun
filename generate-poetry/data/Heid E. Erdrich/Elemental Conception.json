    "She wants to grow from the rich-rotten trunk",
    "of the stamp left to sprout in the chain-linked",
    "alley yard. She wants to be born there.",
    "Or out of dry wind rushing debris around",
    "and cleaning the world like a slate that",
    "hasn\u2019t yet written how her birth will be",
    "if she be born slick-wet and shimmering",
    "in rings like gas spill, born from long trickles",
    "run off curb-piled snow that flows in curtains",
    "any northern winter when it is possible to burn",
    "in water, when flakes against skin so cold brand",
    "their pattern on the new-thought, engraved self."

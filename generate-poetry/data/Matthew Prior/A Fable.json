    "In Aesop\u2019s tales an honest wretch we find,",
    "Whose years and comforts equally declined;",
    "He in two wives had two domestic ills,",
    "For different age they had, and different wills;",
    "One plucked his black hairs out, and one his gray,",
    "The man for quietness did both obey,",
    "Till all his parish saw his head quite bare,",
    "And thought he wanted brains as well as hair.",
    "The parties, henpecked William, are thy wives,",
    "The hairs they pluck are thy prerogatives;",
    "Tories thy person hate, the Whigs thy power,",
    "Though much thou yieldest, still they tug for more,",
    "Till this poor man and thou alike are shown,",
    "He without hair, and thou without a crown."

    "And before hell mouth; dry plain",
    "and two mountains;",
    "On the one mountain, a running form,",
    "and another",
    "In the turn of the hill; in hard steel",
    "The road like a slow screw\u2019s thread,",
    "The angle almost imperceptible,",
    "so that the circuit seemed hardly to rise;",
    "And the running form, naked, Blake,",
    "Shouting, whirling his arms, the swift limbs,",
    "Howling against the evil,",
    "his eyes rolling,",
    "Whirling like flaming cart-wheels,",
    "and his head held backward to gaze on the evil",
    "As he ran from it,",
    "to be hid by the steel mountain,",
    "And when he showed again from the north side;",
    "his eyes blazing toward hell mouth,",
    "His neck forward,",
    "and like him Peire Cardinal.",
    "And in the west mountain, Il Fiorentino,",
    "Seeing hell in his mirror,",
    "and lo Sordels",
    "Looking on it in his shield;",
    "And Augustine, gazing toward the invisible.",
    "And past them, the criminal",
    "lying in the blue lakes of acid,",
    "The road between the two hills, upward",
    "slowly,",
    "The flames patterned in lacquer, crimen est actio,",
    "The limbo of chopped ice and saw-dust,",
    "And I bathed myself with acid to free myself",
    "of the hell ticks,",
    "Scales, fallen louse eggs.",
    "Palux Laerna,",
    "the lake of bodies, aqua morta,",
    "of limbs fluid, and mingled, like fish heaped in a bin,",
    "and here an arm upward, clutching a fragment of marble,",
    "And the embryos, in flux,",
    "new inflow, submerging,",
    "Here an arm upward, trout, submerged by the eels;",
    "and from the bank, the stiff herbage",
    "the dry nobbled path, saw many known, and unknown,",
    "for an instant;",
    "submerging,",
    "The face gone, generation.",
    "Then light, air, under saplings,",
    "the blue banded lake under \u00e6ther,",
    "an oasis, the stones, the calm field,",
    "the grass quiet,",
    "and passing the tree of the bough",
    "The grey stone posts,",
    "and the stair of gray stone,",
    "the passage clean-squared in granite:",
    "descending,",
    "and I through this, and into the earth,",
    "patet terra,",
    "entered the quiet air",
    "the new sky,",
    "the light as after a sun-set,",
    "and by their fountains, the heroes,",
    "Sigismundo, and Malatesta Novello,",
    "and founders, gazing at the mounts of their cities.",
    "The plain, distance, and in fount-pools",
    "the nymphs of that water",
    "rising, spreading their garlands,",
    "weaving their water reeds with the boughs,",
    "In the quiet,",
    "and now one man rose from his fountain",
    "and went off into the plain.",

    "The six chaps in front carrying a long thing",
    "on their shoulders,",
    "And they thought it was a funeral,",
    "but the thing was wrapped up in scarlet,",
    "And he put off in the cutter,",
    "he was a middy in those days,",
    "To see what the natives were doing,",
    "And they got up to the six fellows in livery,",

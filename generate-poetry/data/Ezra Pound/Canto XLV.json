    "With",
    "With usura hath no man a house of good stone",
    "each block cut smooth and well fitting",
    "that design might cover their face,",
    "with usura",
    "hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall",
    "or where virgin receiveth message",
    "and halo projects from incision,",
    "with usura",
    "seeth no man Gonzaga his heirs and his concubines",
    "no picture is made to endure nor to live with",
    "but it is made to sell and sell quickly",
    "with usura, sin against nature,",
    "is thy bread ever more of stale rags",
    "is thy bread dry as paper,",
    "with no mountain wheat, no strong flour",
    "with usura the line grows thick",
    "with usura is no clear demarcation",
    "and no man can find site for his dwelling.",
    "Stonecutter is kept from his tone",
    "weaver is kept from his loom",
    "WITH USURA",
    "wool comes not to market",
    "sheep bringeth no gain with usura",
    "Usura is a murrain, usura",
    "blunteth the needle in the maid\u2019s hand",
    "and stoppeth the spinner\u2019s cunning. Pietro Lombardo",
    "came not by usura",
    "Duccio came not by usura",
    "nor Pier della Francesca; Zuan Bellin\u2019 not by usura",
    "nor was \u2018La Calunnia\u2019 painted.",
    "Came not by usura Angelico; came not Ambrogio Praedis,",
    "Came no church of cut stone signed:",
    "Not by usura St. Trophime",
    "Not by usura Saint Hilaire,",
    "Usura rusteth the chisel",
    "It rusteth the craft and the craftsman",
    "It gnaweth the thread in the loom",
    "None learneth to weave gold in her pattern;",
    "Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered",
    "Emerald findeth no Memling",
    "Usura slayeth the child in the womb",
    "It stayeth the young man\u2019s courting",
    "It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth",
    "between the young bride and her bridegroom",
    "CONTRA NATURAM",
    "They have brought whores for Eleusis",
    "Corpses are set to banquet",
    "at behest of usura.",
    "N.B. Usury: A charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to production; often without regard to the possibilities of production. (Hence the failure of the Medici bank.)"

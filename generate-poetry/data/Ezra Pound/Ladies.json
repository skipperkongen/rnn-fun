    "Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,",
    "All of whom she refused;",
    "And now she turns to me seeking love,",
    "And her hair also is turning.",
    "I have fed your lar with poppies,",
    "I have adored you for three full years;",
    "And now you grumble because your dress does not fit",
    "And because I happen to say so.",
    "Memnon, Memnon, that lady",
    "Who used to walk about amongst us",
    "With such gracious uncertainty,",
    "Is now wedded",
    "To a British householder.",
    "Flawless as Aphrodite,",
    "Thoroughly beautiful,",
    "Brainless,",
    "The faint odor of your patchouli,",
    "Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,",
    "Assails me, and concerns me almost as little."

    "A castaway blown south from the arctic tundra",
    "sits on a stump in an abandoned farmer\u2019s field.",
    "Beyond the dunes cattails toss and bend as snappy",
    "as the surf, rushing and crashing down the jetty.",
    "His head a swivel of round glances,",
    "his eyes a deeper yellow than the winter sun,",
    "he wonders if the spot two hundred feet away",
    "is a mouse on the crawl from mud hole",
    "to deer-grass patch.",
    "An hour of wind and sleet whips the air,",
    "nothing darts or passes but the river underground.",
    "A North Pole creature shows us how to last.",
    "The wind ruffles his feathers from crown to claw",
    "while he gazes into zeroes the salt-slick rain.",
    "As a double-rainbow before us arcs",
    "sky and owl, we leave him surrendering",
    "to the echo of his white refrain."

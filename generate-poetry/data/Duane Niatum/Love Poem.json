    "your song about that longest",
    "moment, a moon vulnerability,",
    "a Natalie I saw alone,",
    "at Carolyn\u2019s party years ago,",
    "where you called me to your side,",
    "and I held my heart, cupped in shadow,",
    "as an offering to your smile,",
    "our soft-spoken isolation."

    "Why Brownlee left, and where he went,",
    "Is a mystery even now.",
    "For if a man should have been content",
    "It was him; two acres of barley,",
    "One of potatoes, four bullocks,",
    "A milker, a slated farmhouse.",
    "He was last seen going out to plough",
    "On a March morning, bright and early.",
    "By noon Brownlee was famous;",
    "They had found all abandoned, with",
    "The last rig unbroken, his pair of black",
    "Horses, like man and wife,",
    "Shifting their weight from foot to",
    "Foot, and gazing into the future."

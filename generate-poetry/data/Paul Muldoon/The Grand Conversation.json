    ". My people came from Korelitz",
    "where they grew yellow cucumbers",
    "and studied the Talmud.",
    "Mine pored over the mud",
    "of mangold- and potato-pits",
    "or flicked through kale plants from Comber",
    "as bibliomancers of old",
    "went a-flicking through deckle-mold.",
    "Mine would lie low in the shtetl",
    "when they heard the distant thunder",
    "stolen by the Cossacks.",
    "It was potato sacks",
    "lumped together on a settle",
    "mine found themselves lying under,",

    "making Defenders of us all.",

    "from the islets of Langerhans",
    "and were granted the deed",
    "to Charlottesville.",
    "Indeed?",
    "My people called a spade a spade",
    "and were admitted to the hanse",
    "of pike- and pickax-men, shovels",
    "leaning to their lean-to hovels.",

    "after the bomb and the bombast",
    "have done their very worst.",

    "we may yet construct our future",
    "as we've reconstructed our past",
    "and cry out, my love, each to each",
    "from his or her own quicken-queach.",
    "Each from his stand of mountain ash",
    "will cry out over valley farms",
    "spotlit with pear blossom.",
    "There some young Absalom",
    "picks his way through cache after cache",
    "of ammunition and small arms",
    "hidden in grain wells, while his nag",
    "tugs at a rein caught on a snag."

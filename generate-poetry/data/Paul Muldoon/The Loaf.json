    "When I put my finger to the hole they've cut for a dimmer switch",
    "in a wall of plaster stiffened with horsehair",
    "it seems I've scratched a two-hundred-year-old itch",
    "When I put my ear to the hole I'm suddenly aware",
    "of spades and shovels turning up the gain",
    "all the way from Raritan to the Delaware",
    "When I put my nose to the hole I smell the floodplain",
    "of the canal after a hurricane",
    "and the spots of green grass where thousands of Irish have lain",
    "When I put my eye to the hole I see one holding horse dung to the rain",
    "in the hope, indeed, indeed,",
    "of washing out a few whole ears of grain",
    "And when I do at last succeed",
    "in putting my mouth to the horsehair-fringed niche",
    "I can taste the small loaf of bread he baked from that whole seed"

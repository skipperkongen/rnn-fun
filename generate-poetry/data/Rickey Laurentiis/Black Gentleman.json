    "There are eyes, glasses even, but still he can\u2019t see",
    "what the world sees seeing him.",

    "to achieve finally flight \u2014",
    "though what\u2019s believed",
    "in him is a flightlessness, a sinking-down,",
    "as any swamp-mess of water I\u2019m always thinking of",
    "might draw down again the washed-up body",
    "of a boy, as any mouth I\u2019ve yearned for would take down,",
    "wrestler-style, the boy\u2019s tongue with its own ...",
    "What an eye can\u2019t imagine",
    "it can\u2019t find: not in blood, swollen in the stiff knees",
    "of a cypress, not definitely in some dreaming man\u2019s dream \u2014",
    "Let\u2019s have his nature speak.",
    "What will the incredible night of him say here, to his thousand",
    "moons, now that he can rise up to any tree, rope or none, but not fear it?"

    "But so tangled in the branches they had to leave it, the conquistador\u2019s",
    "black beard cut from his head whose neck had snapped,",
    "his deadness the others had to burn then, for the wind to take evenly away.",
    "if not for that Native woman\u2019s quick intelligence, out-climbing",
    "This is what I see: the Spanish moss",
    "as convicted to its branches \u2014 gray, colonial,",
    "but in my century now, suspended so close each vein might well be a whole, hanging",
    "fiction of my mind. The moss",
    "is a fiction of my mind: a screen, swinging",
    "on its gothic hinges, making the light fussier as it swags, giving not just the trees",
    "but my idea of them a Medusa look. That man,",
    "I think, had wanted to feed something in himself",
    "not worth feeding, had founded a world on it \u2014",
    "What is it",
    "my mind wants to get at, always extending, hungering, looking",
    "back, always tearing open again its own modernity,",
    "as if each thought is more than the little present",
    "moment it sounds like, but, raised at an angle, piercing me, having me imagine,",
    "to build such antique violences in my head, it is a thorn? This moss",
    "has been growing for ages now, can do nothing",
    "but snag and grow ... What is it the mind won\u2019t",
    "unsee, beautiful flaw? In another version, the woman dies",
    "and her husband",
    "braids her hair",
    "through the trees."

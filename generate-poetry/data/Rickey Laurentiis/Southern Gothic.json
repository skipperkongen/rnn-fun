    "About the dead having available to them",
    "all breeds of knowledge,",
    "some pure, others wicked, especially what is",
    "future, and the history that remains",
    "once the waters recede, revealing the land",
    "that couldn\u2019t reject or contain it, and the land",
    "that is not new, is indigo, is ancient, lived",
    "as all the trees that fit and clothe it are lived,",
    "simple pine, oak, grand magnolia, he said",
    "they frighten him, that what they hold in their silences",
    "silences: sometimes a boy will slip",
    "from his climbing, drown but the myth knows why,",
    "sometimes a boy will swing with the leaves."

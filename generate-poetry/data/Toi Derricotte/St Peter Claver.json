    "Every town with black Catholics has a St. Peter Claver\u2019s.",
    "My first was nursery school.",
    "Miss Maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army cots.",
    "No mother questioned; no child sassed.",
    "In blue pleated skirts, pants, and white shirts,",
    "we stood in line to use the open toilets",
    "and conserved light by walking in darkness.",
    "Unsmiling, mostly light-skinned, we were the children of the middle class, preparing to take our parents\u2019 places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait.",
    "They said it was good for us, the bowl of soup, its pasty whiteness;",
    "I learned to swallow and distrust my senses.",
    "On holy cards St. Peter\u2019s face is olive-toned, his hair near kinky;",
    "I thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor, the light and dark.",
    "Now I read he was \u201ca Spanish Jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the African Negroes and the abolition of the slave trade.\u201d",
    "I was tricked again, robbed of my patron,",
    "and left with a debt to another white man."

    "I love the way the black ants use their dead.",
    "They carry them off like warriors on their steel",
    "backs. They spend hours struggling, lifting,",
    "dragging (it is not grisly as it would be for us,",
    "to carry them back to be eaten),",
    "so that every part will be of service. I think of",
    "my husband at his father\u2019s grave\u2014",
    "the grass had closed",
    "over the headstone, and the name had disappeared. He took out",
    "his pocket knife and cut the grass away, he swept it",
    "with his handkerchief to make it clear. \u201cIs this the way",
    "we\u2019ll be forgotten?\u201d And he bent down over the grave and wept."

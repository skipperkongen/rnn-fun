    ". . . I drank and was surprised",
    "to see what looked like tea leaves",
    "at the bottom",
    "of the cup . . . minutes",
    "later a great warm green wave",
    "or cloud",
    "began advancing towards me. \u201cLook at the boats",
    "on his shirt,\u201d I felt myself trying",
    "to say, in Spanish, or Moroccan, yet knowing",
    "I knew",
    "none of the words . . .",
    "it was bright",
    "morning, and the train had arrived",
    "and emptied",
    "at Chamart\u00edn before I finally",
    "pried open my eyes, and saw",
    "on the carriage floor",
    "nothing but an unfamiliar",
    "pair of trainers: cracked",
    "white leather, with three green stripes. \u201cMister \u2014",
    "or rather Herr \u2014 Adolf",
    "Dassler made these,\u201d I thought. But which",
    "of the two friendly men with whom",
    "I\u2019d shared the carriage, and some wine,",
    "had been wearing them? I pondered",
    "this awhile, then fell",
    "asleep again . . .",
    "and did",
    "Herr Dassler visit, personally, all the cities inscribed",
    "on his trainers? Koln, Dublin, Paris, Montreal,",
    "Kopenhagen, Bern, Amsterdam . . . and fit",
    "the trainer to the city? Rom, like these, Vienna,",
    "London . . .",
    "Se\u00f1or Dassler, I am dreaming of you",
    "on a bench on a platform in a train station",
    "in Madrid, unable",
    "to wake up, a pair",
    "of your trainers, that weren\u2019t mine, but now are,",
    "on my feet . . .",
    "I am swimming, Herr",
    "Dassler, in your wake, though I fear",
    "you are dead, a corpse washed clean by the numbing tides",
    "with three slanting stripes emblazoned",
    "on your chest, your passport and your wallet",
    "drifting to the ocean floor . . .",
    "I discovered",
    "in a pocket \u2014 oh! the kindness",
    "of strangers! \u2014 about",
    "forty pesetas; but casting",
    "around for a joke or silver lining, I found",
    "\u2014 or",
    ", as I put it",
    "to my shoes . . . closing",
    "my eyes, I imagined fingers untying",
    "and easing off my Reeboks, as the train",
    "hurtled through the darkness, the men trying",
    "them on in turn, the ex-owner of these",
    "flexing his toes, padding up and down, nodding",
    "approval. They must have whispered",
    "like parents, as they lifted my shirt and unfastened",
    "my money belt, or perhaps, more like surgeons, they used",
    "scissors, or a knife . . .",
    "snicker-snack! I watched",
    "the vorpal blade trace",
    "arabesques across my breastbone, hover, then slide",
    "between two ribs.",
    "went the trains. The heat",
    "was building, the potion",
    "at last wearing off. How light",
    "I\u2019d be, I now",
    "began to reason, as quick and canny",
    "as a lizard, a perfectly camouflaged",
    "lizard, who\u2019d shed a skin and acquired a new",
    "way of walking."

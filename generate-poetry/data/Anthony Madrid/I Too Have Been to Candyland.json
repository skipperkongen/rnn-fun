    "I TOO have been to Candyland, but I found myself missing the death cult.",
    "I missed the spectacle of the wounded bones being opened and instrumented.",
    "Bill Varner, when he was still just a boy, wrote a stunning line of Arabic verse.",
    "He wrote: \u201cThe crescent moon is a scimitar; the sun, a severed head.\u201d",
    "and this, when he still had to keep his books in a locker!",
    "And he\u2019d never even held hands with a girl\u2014God! Penn State in the 1980s!",
    "In those days, we all sat at the feet of a pig poet, deaf in one ear. One of these",
    "Dreadful \u201cwhite-haired lovers\u201d\u2014oh, but he knew how to touch fire to fuse!",
    "That little stick of fire apt to launch a poetic career! But what is it now?",
    "Merely a billowing cloud of humidity floating out of a tree.",
    "Every turtle, snake, and bird is \u201cborn again\u201d\u2014oh, isn\u2019t that so? The first time,",
    "Out the f\u00eated cloaca\u2014and the next, through the top of the shell.",
    "The \u201cI\u201d is Greek, the \u201cit\u201d Italian, and Dickinson is our Ghalib. But that",
    "Ridiculous piece of dirt you\u2019re kissing on can never be anything but.",
    "Shut your eyes to what a worm he is, concentrate on his caress\u2014but know",
    "Every half-truth is bound to call up its suppressed synoptic double.",
    "Close your eyes and moan softly, your head full of packed cotton\u2014but know",
    "Every hidden camera\u2019s cockpit must one day be delivered of its black box."

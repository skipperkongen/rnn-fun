    "It was at a wine party\u2014",
    "I lay in a drowse, knowing it not.",
    "The blown flowers fell and filled my lap.",
    "When I arose, still drunken,",
    "The birds had all gone to their nests,",
    "And there remained but few of my comrades.",
    "I went along the river\u2014alone in the moonlight."

    "Often beneath the wave, wide from this ledge",
    "The dice of drowned men\u2019s bones he saw bequeath",
    "An embassy. Their numbers as he watched,",
    "Beat on the dusty shore and were obscured.",
    "And wrecks passed without sound of bells,",
    "The calyx of death\u2019s bounty giving back",
    "A scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,",
    "The portent wound in corridors of shells.",
    "Then in the circuit calm of one vast coil,",
    "Its lashings charmed and malice reconciled,",
    "Frosted eyes there were that lifted altars;",
    "And silent answers crept across the stars.",
    "Compass, quadrant and sextant contrive",
    "No farther tides ... High in the azure steeps",
    "Monody shall not wake the mariner.",
    "This fabulous shadow only the sea keeps."

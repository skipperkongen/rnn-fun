    "The willows carried a slow sound,",
    "A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.",
    "I could never remember",
    "That seething, steady leveling of the marshes",
    "Till age had brought me to the sea.",
    "Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves",
    "Where cypresses shared the noon\u2019s",
    "Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.",
    "And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams",
    "Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them",
    "Asunder ...",
    "How much I would have bartered! the black gorge",
    "And all the singular nestings in the hills",
    "Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.",
    "The pond I entered once and quickly fled\u2014",
    "I remember now its singing willow rim.",
    "And finally, in that memory all things nurse;",
    "After the city that I finally passed",
    "With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts",
    "The monsoon cut across the delta",
    "At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes",
    "I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,",
    "And willows could not hold more steady sound."

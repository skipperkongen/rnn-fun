    "I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,",
    "No wraith, but utterly\u2014as still more alone",
    "The Southern Cross takes night",
    "And lifts her girdles from her, one by one\u2014",
    "High, cool,",
    "wide from the slowly smoldering fire",
    "Of lower heavens,\u2014",
    "vaporous scars!",
    "Eve! Magdalene!",
    "or Mary, you?",
    "Whatever call\u2014falls vainly on the wave.",
    "O simian Venus, homeless Eve,",
    "Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve",
    "Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;",
    "Finally to answer all within one grave!",
    "And this long wake of phosphor,",
    "iridescent",
    "Furrow of all our travel\u2014trailed derision!",
    "Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell",
    "Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision",
    "The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",
    "I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross",
    "Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.",
    "It is blood to remember; it is fire",
    "To stammer back . . . It is",
    "God\u2014your namelessness. And the wash\u2014",
    "All night the water combed you with black",
    "Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",
    "Water rattled that stinging coil, your",
    "Rehearsed hair\u2014docile, alas, from many arms.",
    "Yes, Eve\u2014wraith of my unloved seed!",
    "The Cross, a phantom, buckled\u2014dropped below the dawn.",
    "Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn."

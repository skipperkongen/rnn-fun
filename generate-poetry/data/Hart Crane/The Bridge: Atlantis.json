    "Through the bound cable strands, the arching path",
    "Upward, veering with light, the flight of strings,\u2014",
    "Taut miles of shuttling moonlight syncopate",
    "The whispered rush, telepathy of wires.",
    "Up the index of night, granite and steel\u2014",
    "Transparent meshes\u2014fleckless the gleaming staves\u2014",
    "Sibylline voices flicker, waveringly stream",
    "As though a god were issue of the strings. . . .",
    "And through that cordage, threading with its call",
    "One arc synoptic of all tides below\u2014",
    "Their labyrinthine mouths of history",
    "Pouring reply as though all ships at sea",
    "Complighted in one vibrant breath made cry,\u2014",
    "\u201cMake thy love sure\u2014to weave whose song we ply!\u201d",
    "\u2014From black embankments, moveless soundings hailed,",
    "So seven oceans answer from their dream.",
    "And on, obliquely up bright carrier bars",
    "New octaves trestle the twin monoliths",
    "Beyond whose frosted capes the moon bequeaths",
    "Two worlds of sleep (O arching strands of song!)\u2014",
    "Onward and up the crystal-flooded aisle",
    "White tempest nets file upward, upward ring",
    "With silver terraces the humming spars,",
    "The loft of vision, palladium helm of stars.",
    "Sheerly the eyes, like seagulls stung with rime\u2014",
    "Slit and propelled by glistening fins of light\u2014",
    "Pick biting way up towering looms that press",
    "Sidelong with flight of blade on tendon blade",
    "\u2014Tomorrows into yesteryear\u2014and link",
    "What cipher-script of time no traveller reads",
    "But who, through smoking pyres of love and death,",
    "Searches the timeless laugh of mythic spears.",
    "Like hails, farewells\u2014up planet-sequined heights",
    "Some trillion whispering hammers glimmer Tyre:",
    "Serenely, sharply up the long anvil cry",
    "Of inchling aeons silence rivets Troy.",
    "And you, aloft there\u2014Jason! hesting Shout!",
    "Still wrapping harness to the swarming air!",
    "Silvery the rushing wake, surpassing call,",
    "Beams yelling Aeolus! splintered in the straits!",
    "From gulfs unfolding, terrible of drums,",
    "Tall Vision-of-the-Voyage, tensely spare\u2014",
    "Bridge, lifting night to cycloramic crest",
    "Of deepest day\u2014O Choir, translating time",
    "Into what multitudinous Verb the suns",
    "And synergy of waters ever fuse, recast",
    "In myriad syllables,\u2014Psalm of Cathay!",
    "O Love, thy white, pervasive Paradigm . . . !",
    "We left the haven hanging in the night",
    "Sheened harbor lanterns backward fled the keel.",
    "Pacific here at time\u2019s end, bearing corn,\u2014",
    "Eyes stammer through the pangs of dust and steel.",
    "And still the circular, indubitable frieze",
    "Of heaven\u2019s meditation, yoking wave",
    "To kneeling wave, one song devoutly binds\u2014",
    "The vernal strophe chimes from deathless strings!",
    "O Thou steeled Cognizance whose leap commits",
    "The agile precincts of the lark\u2019s return;",
    "Within whose lariat sweep encinctured sing",
    "In single chrysalis the many twain,\u2014",
    "Of stars Thou art the stitch and stallion glow",
    "And like an organ, Thou, with sound of doom\u2014",
    "Sight, sound and flesh Thou leadest from time\u2019s realm",
    "As love strikes clear direction for the helm.",
    "Swift peal of secular light, intrinsic Myth",
    "Whose fell unshadow is death\u2019s utter wound,\u2014",
    "O River-throated\u2014iridescently upborne",
    "Through the bright drench and fabric of our veins;",
    "With white escarpments swinging into light,",
    "Sustained in tears the cities are endowed",
    "And justified conclamant with ripe fields",
    "Revolving through their harvests in sweet torment.",
    "Forever Deity\u2019s glittering Pledge, O Thou",
    "Whose canticle fresh chemistry assigns",
    "To wrapt inception and beatitude,\u2014",
    "Always through blinding cables, to our joy,",
    "Of thy white seizure springs the prophecy:",
    "Always through spiring cordage, pyramids",
    "Of silver sequel, Deity\u2019s young name",
    "Kinetic of white choiring wings . . . ascends.",
    "Migrations that must needs void memory,",
    "Inventions that cobblestone the heart,\u2014",
    "Unspeakable Thou Bridge to Thee, O Love.",
    "Thy pardon for this history, whitest Flower,",
    "O Answerer of all,\u2014Anemone,\u2014",
    "Now while thy petals spend the suns about us, hold\u2014",
    "(O Thou whose radiance doth inherit me)",
    "Atlantis,\u2014hold thy floating singer late!",
    "So to thine Everpresence, beyond time,",
    "Like spears ensanguined of one tolling star",
    "That bleeds infinity\u2014the orphic strings,",
    "Sidereal phalanxes, leap and converge:",
    "\u2014One Song, one Bridge of Fire! Is it Cathay,",
    "Now pity steeps the grass and rainbows ring",
    "The serpent with the eagle in the leaves. . . . ?",
    "Whispers antiphonal in azure swing."

    "This tuft that thrives on saline nothingness,",
    "Inverted octopus with heavenward arms",
    "Thrust parching from a palm-bole hard by the cove\u23af",
    "A bird almost\u23afof almost bird alarms,",
    "Is pulmonary to the wind that jars",
    "Its tentacles, horrific in their lurch.",
    "The lizard\u2019s throat, held bloated for a fly,",
    "Balloons but warily from this throbbing perch.",
    "The needles and hack-saws of cactus bleed",
    "A milk of earth when stricken off the stalk;",
    "But this,\u23afdefenseless, thornless, sheds no blood,",
    "Almost no shadow\u23afbut the air\u2019s thin talk.",
    "Angelic Dynamo! Ventriloquist of the Blue!",
    "While beachward creeps the shark-swept Spanish Main",
    "By what conjunctions do the winds appoint",
    "Its apotheosis, at last\u23afthe hurricane!"

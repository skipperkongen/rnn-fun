    "As silent as a mirror is believed",
    "Realities plunge in silence by ...",
    "I am not ready for repentance;",
    "Nor to match regrets. For the moth",
    "Bends no more than the still",
    "Imploring flame. And tremorous",
    "In the white falling flakes",
    "Kisses are,\u2014",
    "The only worth all granting.",
    "It is to be learned\u2014",
    "This cleaving and this burning,",
    "But only by the one who",
    "Spends out himself again.",
    "Twice and twice",
    "(Again the smoking souvenir,",
    "Bleeding eidolon!) and yet again.",
    "Until the bright logic is won",
    "Unwhispering as a mirror",
    "Is believed.",
    "Then, drop by caustic drop, a perfect cry",
    "Shall string some constant harmony,\u2014",
    "Relentless caper for all those who step",
    "The legend of their youth into the noon."

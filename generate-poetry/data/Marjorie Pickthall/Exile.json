    "I chose the place where I would rest",
    "When death should come to claim me,",
    "With the red-rose roots to wrap my breast",
    "And a quiet stone to name me.",
    "But I am laid on a northern steep",
    "With the roaring tides below me,",
    "And only the frosts to bind my sleep,",
    "And only the winds to know me."

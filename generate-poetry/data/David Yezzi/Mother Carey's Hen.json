    "There are days I don\u2019t think about the sea;",
    "weeks wash by in fact,",
    "then a shearwater\u2014or some such\u2014flutters by",
    "on the salt flats fanning out in my mind\u2019s eye,",
    "reflected there, a shimmering reverie,",
    "recalling the pact",
    "I once made (and renew today) to hold",
    "to a higher altitude.",
    "But note the difference between this bird",
    "and me: a slight disruption or harsh word",
    "and I crash, folded seaward, letting cold",
    "life intrude;",
    "whereas the petrel, mindless of such height,",
    "scales each watery hill",
    "that rises up, adapting to the shape",
    "of each impediment, each low escape",
    "instinct in it, the scope of its flight",
    "fitted to its will."

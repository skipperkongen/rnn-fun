    "Hard to reach, so you yank your clothes",
    "getting at it\u2014the button at your neck,",
    "the knotted shoe. You snake your fingers in",
    "until your nails possess the patch of skin",
    "that\u2019s eating you. And now you\u2019re in the throes",
    "of ecstasy, eyes lolling in your skull,",
    "as if sensing the first time the joy one takes",
    "in being purely animal.",
    "It\u2019s so good to have a scratch,",
    "though isn\u2019t it a drag living like this,",
    "jounced on a high wire of impulses,",
    "every wish the same programmed response",
    "to another signal passed from cell to cell,",
    "amounting in the end to a distraction\u2014",
    "if truth be told\u2014from rarer things, thoughts free",
    "from the anchor-chain of self?",
    "For even the least sweetness, we",
    "behave like the old man on the low wall",
    "I saw outside the hospital today,",
    "who had his hand inside his flannel shirt,",
    "scratching at his chest, trancelike, agog,",
    "his eyelids fluttering like butterflies",
    "in a meadow of snowy Queen Anne\u2019s lace.",
    "I never saw him stop.",
    "Such root satisfaction is like",
    "the dying desert legionnaire\u2019s in films,",
    "when he finds, against all odds, a water jug",
    "and, lifting it, delights to feel it heavy.",
    "The score swells, his eyes relume. He tugs",
    "the stopper out, then fills his mouth with sand.",
    "Though, worse: we\u2019ve seen the film; we know it\u2019s sand;",
    "we gulp it anyway."

    "from the cliff's edge,",
    "kicking her feet in panic and despair",
    "as the circle of light contracts and blackness",
    "takes the screen. And that",
    "is how we leave her, hanging\u2014though we know",
    "she will be rescued, only to descend",
    "into fresh harm, the story flowing on,",
    "disaster and reprieve\u2014systole, diastole\u2014split",
    "rhythm of a heart that hungers",
    "only to go on. So why is this like my mother,",
    "caged in a railed bed, each breath,",
    "a fresh installment in a tortured tale",
    "of capture and release? Nine days",
    "she dangled, stubborn,",
    "over the abyss, the soft clay crumbling",
    "beneath her fingertips, until she dropped",
    "with a little bird cry of surprise",
    "into the swift river below.",
    "Here metaphor collapses, for there was no love",
    "to rescue her, no small boat",
    "waiting with a net to fish her out,",
    "although the water carried her,",
    "and it was April when we buried her",
    "among the weeping cherries and the waving",
    "flags and in the final fade, a heron",
    "breasted the far junipers",
    "to gain the tremulous air and swim away."

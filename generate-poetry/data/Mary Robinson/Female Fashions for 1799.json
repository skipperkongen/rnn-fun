    "A FORM, as any taper, fine ;",
    "A head like half-pint bason ;",
    "Where golden cords, and bands entwine,",
    "As rich as fleece of JASON.",
    "A pair of shoulders strong and wide,",
    "Like",
    "enlisting ;",
    "Bare arms long dangling by the side,",
    "And shoes of ragged listing !",
    "Cravats like towels, thick and broad,",
    "Long tippets made of bear-skin,",
    "Muffs that a RUSSIAN might applaud,",
    "And",
    "to spoil a fair skin.",
    "Long petticoats to",
    "the feet,",
    "Silk hose with clocks of scarlet ;",
    "A load of perfume, sick'ning sweet,",
    "Bought of PARISIAN VARLET.",
    "A bush of hair, the brow to shade,",
    "Sometimes the eyes to cover ;",
    "A necklace that might be display'd",
    "By OTAHEITEAN lover !",
    "A bowl of straw to deck the head,",
    "Like porringer unmeaning ;",
    "A bunch of POPPIES flaming red,",
    "With motly ribands streaming.",
    "Bare ears on either side the head,",
    "Like wood-wild savage SATYR ;",
    "Tinted with deep vermilion red,",
    "To shame the blush of nature.",
    "Red elbows, gauzy gloves, that add",
    "An icy cov'ring merely ;",
    "A wadded coat, the shape to pad,",
    "Like Dutch-women \u2014 or nearly.",
    "Such is CAPRICE ! but, lovely kind !",
    "Oh ! let each mental feature",
    "Proclaim the labour of the",
    ",",
    "And leave your charms to NATURE."

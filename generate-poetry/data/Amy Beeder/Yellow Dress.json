    "Girl on a heap of street sweepings high",
    "as a pyre, laid on snarled wire & dented rim.",
    "Girl set down among the wrung-out hides.",
    "A girl who was coming from church. It is late",
    "Sunday afternoon.",
    "In Tet Bef by the dirty ocean",
    "thousands crush past her without pausing",
    "at the shrine of her spayed limbs; brilliance",
    "like the flesh of lilies sprouting from the pummeled cane.",
    "I am waiting for her mother to find her, still",
    "wearing one white spotless glove",
    "my idle taxi level with her unbruised arm,",
    "her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen flower",
    "? Let someone have gathered her up",
    "before the stars assembled coldly overhead:",
    "her dress brighter than gold, crocus, the yolk of an egg",
    "; let them",
    "have found her & borne her though the traffic's clamor",
    "veiled with a stranger's handkerchief."

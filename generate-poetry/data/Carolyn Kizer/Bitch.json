    "Now, when he and I meet, after all these years,",
    "I say to the bitch inside me, don\u2019t start growling.",
    "He isn\u2019t a trespasser anymore,",
    "Just an old acquaintance tipping his hat.",
    "My voice says, \u201cNice to see you,\u201d",
    "As the bitch starts to bark hysterically.",
    "He isn\u2019t an enemy now,",
    "Where are your manners, I say, as I say,",
    "\u201cHow are the children? They must be growing up.\u201d",
    "At a kind word from him, a look like the old days,",
    "The bitch changes her tone; she begins to whimper.",
    "She wants to snuggle up to him, to cringe.",
    "Down, girl! Keep your distance",
    "Or I\u2019ll give you a taste of the choke-chain.",
    "\u201cFine, I\u2019m just fine,\u201d I tell him.",
    "She slobbers and grovels.",
    "After all, I am her mistress. She is basically loyal.",
    "It\u2019s just that she remembers how she came running",
    "Each evening, when she heard his step;",
    "How she lay at his feet and looked up adoringly",
    "Though he was absorbed in his paper;",
    "Or, bored with her devotion, ordered her to the kitchen",
    "Until he was ready to play.",
    "But the small careless kindnesses",
    "When he\u2019d had a good day, or a couple of drinks,",
    "Come back to her now, seem more important",
    "Than the casual cruelties, the ultimate dismissal.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know you are doing so well,\u201d I say.",
    "He couldn\u2019t have taken you with him;",
    "You were too demonstrative, too clumsy,",
    "Not like the well-groomed pets of his new friends.",
    "\u201cGive my regards to your wife,\u201d I say. You gag",
    "As I drag you off by the scruff,",
    "Saying, \u201cGoodbye! Goodbye! Nice to have seen you again.\u201d"

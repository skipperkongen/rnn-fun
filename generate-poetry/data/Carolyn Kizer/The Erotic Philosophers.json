    "It\u2019s a spring morning; sun pours in the window",
    "As I sit here drinking coffee, reading Augustine.",
    "And finding him, as always, newly minted",
    "From when I first encountered him in school.",
    "Today I\u2019m overcome with astonishment",
    "At the way we girls denied all that was mean",
    "In those revered philosophers we studied;",
    "Who found us loathsome, loathsomely seductive;",
    "Irrelevant, at best, to noble discourse",
    "Among the sex, the only sex that counted.",
    "Wounded, we pretended not to mind it",
    "And wore tight sweaters to tease our shy professor.",
    "We sat in autumn sunshine \u201cas the clouds arose",
    "From slimy desires of the flesh, and from",
    "Youth\u2019s seething spring.\u201d Thank you, Augustine.",
    "Attempting to seem blas\u00e9, our cheeks on fire,",
    "It didn\u2019t occur to us to rush from the room.",
    "Instead we brushed aside \u201cthe briars of unclean desire\u201d",
    "And struggled on through mires of misogyny",
    "Till we arrived at Kierkegaard, and began to see",
    "That though Saint A. and S\u00f8ren had much in common",
    "Including fear and trembling before women,",
    "The Saint scared himself, while S\u00f8ren was scared of",
    "Had we, poor girls, been flattered by their thralldom?",
    "Yes, it was always us, the rejected feminine",
    "From whom temptation came. It was our flesh",
    "With its deadly sweetness that led them on.",
    "Yet how could we not treasure Augustine,",
    "\u201cStuck fast in the bird-lime of pleasure\u201d?",
    "That roomful of adolescent poets manqu\u00e9",
    "Assuaged, bemused by music, let the meaning go.",
    "Swept by those psalmic cadences, we were seduced!",
    "Some of us tried for a while to be well-trained souls",
    "And pious seekers, enmeshed in the Saint\u2019s dialectic:",
    "A sensible girl would have barked like a dog before God.",
    "We students, children still, were shocked to learn",
    "The children these men desired were younger than we!",
    "Augustine fancied a girl about eleven,",
    "The age of Adeodatus, Augustine\u2019s son.",
    "S\u00f8ren, like Poe, eyed his girl before she was sixteen,",
    "To impose his will on a malleable child, when",
    "She was not equipped to withstand or understand him.",
    "Ah, the Pygmalion instinct! Mold the clay!",
    "Create the compliant doll that can only obey,",
    "Expecting to be abandoned, minute by minute.",
    "It was then I abandoned philosophy,",
    "A minor loss, although I majored in it.",
    "But we were a group of sunny innocents.",
    "I don\u2019t believe we knew what evil meant.",
    "Now I live with a well-trained soul who deals with evil,",
    "Including error, material or spiritual,",
    "Easily, like changing a lock on the kitchen door.",
    "He prays at set times and in chosen places",
    "(At meals, in church), while I",
    "Pray without thinking how or when to pray,",
    "In a low mumble, several times a day,",
    "Like running a continuous low fever;",
    "The sexual impulse for the most part being over.",
    "Believing I believe. Not banking on it ever.",
    "It\u2019s afternoon. I sit here drinking kir",
    "And reading Kierkegaard: \u201cAll sin begins with fear.\u201d",
    "(True. We lie first from terror of our parents.)",
    "In, I believe, an oblique crack at Augustine,",
    "S\u00f8ren said by denying the erotic",
    "It was brought to the attention of the world.",
    "The rainbow curtain rises on the sensual:",
    "Christians must admit it before they can deny it.",
    "He reflected on his father\u2019s fierce repression",
    "Of the sexual, which had bent him out of shape;",
    "Yet he had to pay obeisance to that power:",
    "He chose his father when he broke with his Regina.",
    "It is brought to the attention of the world.",
    "You must admit it before you can deny it.",
    "So much for \u201cRepetition\u201d\u2014another theory",
    "Which some assume evolved from his belief",
    "He could replay his courtship of Regina",
    "With a happy ending. Meanwhile she\u2019d wait for him,",
    "Eternally faithful, eternally seventeen.",
    "Instead, within two years, the bitch got married.",
    "In truth, he couldn\u2019t wait till he got rid of her,",
    "To create from recollection, not from living;",
    "To use the material, not the material girl.",
    "I sip my kir, thinking of",
    "Especially",
    "starring poor Elvira.",
    "He must have seen",
    "a score of times,",
    "And S\u00f8ren knew the score.",
    "He took Regina to the opera only once,",
    "And as soon as Mozart\u2019s overture was over,",
    "Kierkegaard stood up and said, \u201cNow we are leaving.",
    "You have heard the best: the expectation of pleasure.\u201d",
    "In his interminable aria on the subject",
    "S.K. insisted the performance",
    "the play.",
    "Was the overture then the foreplay? Poor Regina",
    "Should have known she\u2019d be left waiting in the lurch.",
    "Though he chose a disguise in which to rhapsodize,",
    "It was his voice too: Elvira\u2019s beauty",
    "Would perish soon; the deflowered quickly fade:",
    "A night-blooming cereus after Juan\u2019s one-night stand.",
    "S\u00f8ren, eyes clouded by romantic mist,",
    "Portrayed Elvira always sweet sixteen.",
    "S.K.\u2019s interpretation seems naive.",
    "He didn\u2019t seem to realize that innocent sopranos",
    "Who are ready to sing Elvira, don\u2019t exist.",
    "His diva may have had it off with Leporello",
    "Just before curtain time, believing it freed her voice",
    "(So backstage legend has it), and weakened his.",
    "I saw La Stupenda sing Elvira once.",
    "Her cloak was larger than an army tent.",
    "Would Giovanni be engulfed when she inhaled?",
    "Would the boards shiver when she stamped her foot?",
    "Her voice of course was great. Innocent it was not.",
    "S\u00f8ren, long since, would have fallen in a faint.",
    "When he, or his doppelg\u00e4nger, wrote",
    "That best-seller, \u201cThe Diary of a Seducer,\u201d",
    "He showed how little he knew of true Don Juans:",
    "Those turgid letters, machinations, and excursions,",
    "Those tedious conversations with dull aunts,",
    "Those convoluted efforts to get the girl!",
    "Think of the worldly European readers",
    "Who took S\u00f8ren seriously, did not see",
    "His was the cynicism of the timid virgin.",
    "Once in my youth I knew a real Don Juan",
    "Or he knew me. He didn\u2019t need to try,",
    "The characteristic of a true seducer.",
    "He seems vulnerable, shy; he hardly speaks.",
    "Somehow, you know he will never speak of you.",
    "You trust him\u2014and you thrust yourself at him.",
    "He responds with an almost absentminded grace.",
    "Even before the consummation he\u2019s looking past you",
    "For the next bright yearning pretty face.",
    "Relieved at last of anxieties and tensions",
    "When your terrible efforts to capture him are over,",
    "You overflow with happy/unhappy languor.",
    "But S.K\u2019s alter-ego believes the truly terrible",
    "Is for you to be consoled by the love of another.",
    "We women, deserted to a woman, have a duty",
    "To rapidly lose our looks, decline, and die,",
    "Our only chance of achieving romantic beauty.",
    "So Augustine was sure, when Monica, his mother,",
    "Made him put aside his nameless concubine",
    "She\u2019d get her to a nunnery, and pine.",
    "He chose his mother when he broke with his beloved.",
    "In S\u00f8ren\u2019s long replay of his wrecked romance,",
    "\u201cGuilty/Not Guilty,\u201d he says he must tear himself away",
    "From earthly love, and suffer to love God.",
    "Augustine thought better: love, human therefore flawed,",
    "Is the way to the love of God. To deny this truth",
    "Is to be \u201cleft outside, breathing into the dust,",
    "Filling the eyes with earth.\u201d We women,",
    "Outside, breathing dust, are still the Other.",
    "The evening sun goes down; time to fix dinner.",
    "\u201c",
    "\u201d We know.",
    "But we remain philosophic, and say with the Saint,",
    "\u201cLet me enter my chamber and sing my songs of love.\u201d"

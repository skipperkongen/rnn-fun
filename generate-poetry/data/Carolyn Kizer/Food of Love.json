    "I\u2019m going to murder you with love;",
    "I\u2019m going to suffocate you with embraces;",
    "I\u2019m going to hug you, bone by bone,",
    "Till you\u2019re dead all over.",
    "Then I will dine on your delectable marrow.",
    "You will become my personal Sahara;",
    "I\u2019ll sun myself in you, then with one swallow",
    "Drain your remaining brackish well.",
    "With my female blade I\u2019ll carve my name",
    "In your most aspiring palm",
    "Before I chop it down.",
    "Then I\u2019ll inhale your last oasis whole.",
    "But in the total desert you become",
    "You\u2019ll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,",
    "Opulent mirage!",
    "Wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.",
    "Vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.",
    "So you will summon each dry grain of sand",
    "And move toward me in undulating dunes",
    "Till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:",
    "A Mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;",
    "Obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes",
    "Your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,",
    "Surprising life! And I will be that green.",
    "When you are fed and watered, flourishing",
    "With shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,",
    "Till you are resurrected field in bloom,",
    "I will devour you, my natural food,",
    "My host, my final supper on the earth,",
    "And you\u2019ll begin to die again.\ufeff"

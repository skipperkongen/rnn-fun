    "As we are so wonderfully done with each other",
    "We can walk into our separate sleep",
    "On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies",

    "Your lips have splashed my dull house with the speech of flowers",

    "soft curving.",
    "It is good to be weary from that brilliant work",
    "It is being God to feel your breathing under me",
    "A waterglass on the bureau fills with morning . . .",
    "Don\u2019t let anyone in to wake us."

    "We must be slow and delicate; return",
    "the policeman's stare with some esteem,",
    "remember this is not a shadow play",
    "of doves and geese but this is now",
    "the time to write it down, record the words\u2014",
    "I mean we should have left some pride",
    "of youth and not forget the destiny of men",
    "who say goodbye to the wives and homes",
    "they've read about at breakfast in a restaurant:",
    "\"My love.\"\u2014without regret or bitterness",
    "obtain the measure of the stride we make,",
    "the latest song has chosen a theme of love",
    "delivering us from all evil\u2014destroy. . . ?",
    "why no. . . this too is fanciful. . . funny how",
    "hard it is to be slow and delicate in this,",
    "this thing of framing words to mark this grave",
    "I mean nothing short of blood in every street",
    "on earth can fitly voice the loss of these."

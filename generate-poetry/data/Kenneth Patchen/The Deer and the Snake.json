    "The deer is humble, lovely as God made her",
    "I watch her eyes and think of wonder owned",
    "These strange priests enter the cathedral of woods",
    "And seven Marys clean their hands to woo her",
    "Foot lifted, dagger-sharp\u2014her ears",
    "Poised to their points like a leaf's head",
    "But the snake strikes, in a velvet arc",
    "Of murderous speed\u2014assassin beautiful",
    "As mountain water at which a fawn drank",
    "While I stand counting the arms of your Cross",
    "Thinking that many Christs could hang there, crying."

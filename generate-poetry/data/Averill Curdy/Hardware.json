    "Sullen and certain",
    "As minor royalty rusticated to this",
    "Unhelpful climate of solvents, gaskets, pliers, and bolts.",

    "O my soul,",
    "To exhaust the realm of the possible when",
    "Ever the light",
    "Is uncongenial as February and your hand unlovely?",
    "Like a dog nearly annihilated by nerves",

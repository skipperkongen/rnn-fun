    "Into multiple-launch-surface, anti-tank missiles",
    "Swarmed through numbered bank accounts",
    "Like Ovid\u2019s seething knotted seed of frog-slime,",
    "Which not seldome attracted by the sun falls",
    "In little frogs with the rain; when it also rained",
    "Radionuclides, strontium, caesium,",
    "Over river",
    "Exile, before the prevailing winds blew them all",
    "Across Europe from Chernobyl (jewel of a name",
    "That means",
    "Wet branches breaking, those were your breaths",
    "Ripped out of the air. What was it hiding you",
    "So that at every hour\u2019s dusk I startled on you",
    "Where you lay, nearly resigned in the talons",
    "Of your most personal shape? Something still",
    "Obdurate, still wild as the horned lark",
    "Rising from its nest at the hunter\u2019s feet.",
    "I didn\u2019t allow you to speak what I didn\u2019t know",
    "To ask. As far as the bolted iron door to adust",
    "I could have followed, to watch the way",
    "You put on your \ufb02ame like sweetness",
    "Wearing the skin of a lion,",
    "My vigil mild while bones leached minerals",
    "Of ash, but your same small jeweled hand",
    "Belonging to a Roman matron that I see,",
    "Its livid reach forth the black igneous rock.",
    "Too late to retrieve the truth, too late not to",
    "Have been like the alchemist who, lowered by rope",
    "Into the volcano, feeling the sharp concussion",
    "Of heat, reported his own eyes saw olive groves",
    "What can I make of this? Oh, what am I to make?"

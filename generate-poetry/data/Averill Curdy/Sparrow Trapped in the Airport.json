    "Never the bark and abalone mask",
    "cracked by storms of a mastering god,",
    "never the gods\u2019 favored glamour, never",
    "the pelagic messenger bearing orchards",
    "in its beak, never allegory, not wisdom",
    "or valor or cunning, much less hunger",
    "demanding vigilance, industry, invention,",
    "or the instinct to claim some small rise",
    "above the plain and from there to assert",
    "the song of another day ending;",
    "lentil brown, uncounted, overlooked",
    "in the clamorous public of the flock",
    "so unlikely to be noticed here by arrivals,",
    "faces shining with oils of their many miles,",
    "where it hops and scratches below",
    "the baggage carousel and lights too high,",
    "too bright for any real illumination,",
    "looking more like a fumbled punch line",
    "than a stowaway whose revelation",
    "recalls how lightly we once traveled."

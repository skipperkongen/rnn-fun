    "They have us corralled",

    "in neat little rows.",

    "carpet reserved for those who\u2019ve held out",
    "the longest. No creditors have come to claim us",
    "today. We\u2019re small-time.",
    "This guy from the graveyard shift",
    "stares at his steel-toed boots, nervous hands",
    "in his lap. None of us look each other",
    "in the eye. We steal quick looks\u2014",
    "get here. . .",
    "chemo bills, a gambling addiction,",
    "a summer spent unemployed and too many",
    "cash advances to pay the rent.",
    "We examine the pipes that hang",
    "from the ceiling, the scratched tiles on the floor,",
    "the red glow of the exit sign at the end of the hall",
    "so like our other failed escapes:",
    "light of the TV at night,",
    "glass of cheap Merlot beside a lamp,",
    "a stop light on the way out of town."

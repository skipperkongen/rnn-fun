    "Behind the Fauverie a crawl of quayside traffic",
    "while Aramis roars for his food, the air",
    "turbulent as he opens his jaws in a huge",
    "yawn. If I hold my breath, half-close my eyes",
    "and listen hard \u2014 there at the tongue\u2019s root,",
    "in the voicebox of night, I might hear",
    "the almost-vanished. He\u2019s summoning his prey,",
    "this lord of thunderbolts, calling to ghosts",
    "of the Lost World, with this evening chant",
    "to scarlet macaw, tapir, golden lion tamarin.",
    "Until everything goes slow and the rush-hour",
    "queue of scale-to-scale cars is one giant caiman",
    "basking on the bank. The jaguar\u2019s all",
    "swimming stealth now \u2014 no sound \u2014 a stalker",
    "camouflaged by floating hyacinths, senses",
    "tuned only to the reptile of the road. Then, with",
    "one bound, spray scatters like glass, as Aramis",
    "lands on the brute\u2019s back and bites its neck."

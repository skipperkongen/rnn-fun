    "Over our heads, trailing a wake of air",
    "and an enormous shadow as it passed,",
    "the falcon glided to its trainer\u2019s fist",
    "and settled like a loaded weapon there.",
    "Then, while she fed the bird bit after bit",
    "of... what? rabbit? the trainer gave her talk:",
    "These birds, she said, prey on the small and weak,",
    "adding for the children\u2019s benefit",
    "that this, though it seems cruel, is really good",
    "since otherwise the other rabbits, mice,",
    "squirrels, what have you, would run out of space",
    "and die of illness or a lack of food.",
    "I know what she was trying to get across,",
    "and I don\u2019t doubt it would be healthier",
    "if we were more familiar than we are",
    "with how the natural world draws life from loss;",
    "and granted, nothing is more natural",
    "than death incarnate falling from the sky;",
    "and granted, it is better some should die,",
    "however agonizingly, than all.",
    "Still, to teach children this is how things go",
    "is one thing, to insist that it is good",
    "is something else\u2014it is to make a god",
    "of an unsatisfactory status quo,",
    "this vicious circle that the clock hands draw",
    "and quarter, while the serpent bites its tail,",
    "or eats the dust, or strikes at someone\u2019s heel,",
    "or winds up comprehended by a claw.",
    "She launched the bird again. We watched it climb",
    "out of the amphitheatre, headed toward",
    "the darkened spires of a nearby wood,",
    "then bank, then angle toward us one last time."

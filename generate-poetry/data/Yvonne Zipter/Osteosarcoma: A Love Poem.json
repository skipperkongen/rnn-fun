    "Cancer loves the long bone,",
    "the femur and the fibula,",
    "the humerus and ulna,",
    "the greyhound\u2019s sleek physique,",
    "a calumet, ribboned with fur",
    "and eddies of dust churned to a smoke,",
    "the sweet slenderness of that languorous",
    "lick of calcium, like an ivory flute or a stalk",
    "of Spiegelau stemware, its bowl",
    "bruised, for an eye blink, with burgundy,",
    "a reed, a wand, the violin\u2019s bow \u2014",
    "loves the generous line of your lanky limbs,",
    "the distance between points A and D,",
    "epic as Western Avenue, which never seems to end",
    "but then of course it does, emptying",
    "its miles into the Cal-Sag Channel",
    "that river of waste and sorrow.",
    "I\u2019ve begun a scrapbook:",
    "here the limp that started it all, here",
    "your scream when the shoulder bone broke,",
    "here that walk to the water dish,",
    "your leg trailing like a length",
    "of black bunting. And here the words I whispered",
    "when your ears lay like spent milkweed pods",
    "on that beautiful silky head:",
    "in that madcap zigzag,",
    "unzipping the air."

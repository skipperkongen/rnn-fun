    "Maybe my soul is straight and good,",
    "but she\u2019s got to lug my heart, my blood,",
    "which all hurts because it\u2019s crooked;",
    "its weight sends her staggering.",
    "She has no bed, she has no home,",
    "she merely hangs on my sharp bones,",
    "flapping her terrible wings.",
    "And my hands are completely shot,",
    "shriveled, worn: here, take a look",
    "at how they clammily, clumsily hop",
    "like rain-crazed toads.",
    "As for all the other stuff,",
    "it\u2019s all used up and sad and old\u2014",
    "why doesn\u2019t God haul me out to the muck",
    "and let me drop.",
    "Is it because of my mug",
    "with its frowning mouth?",
    "So often I would itch",
    "to be luminous and free of fog",
    "but nothing would approach",
    "except big dogs.",
    "And the dogs got zilch."

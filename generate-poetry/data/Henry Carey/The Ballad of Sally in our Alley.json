    "Of all the Girls that are so smart",
    "There\u2019s none like pretty SALLY,",
    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",
    "And she lives in our Alley.",
    "There is no Lady in the Land",
    "Is half so sweet as SALLY,",
    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",
    "And she lives in our Alley.",
    "Her Father he makes Cabbage-nets,",
    "And through the Streets does cry \u2019em;",
    "Her Mother she sells Laces long,",
    "To such as please to buy \u2019em:",

    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",
    "And she lives in our Alley.",
    "When she is by I leave my Work,",
    "(I love her so sincerely)",
    "My Master comes like any Turk,",
    "And bangs me most severely;",
    "But, let him bang his Belly full,",
    "I\u2019ll bear it all for SALLY;",
    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",
    "And she lives in our Alley.",
    "Of all the Days that\u2019s in the Week,",
    "I dearly love but one Day,",
    "And that\u2019s the Day that comes betwixt",
    "A Saturday and Monday;",
    "For then I\u2019m drest, all in my best,",
    "To walk abroad with SALLY;",
    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",
    "And she lives in our Alley.",
    "My Master carries me to Church,",
    "And often am I blamed,",
    "Because I leave him in the lurch,",
    "As soon as Text is named:",
    "I leave the Church in Sermon time,",
    "And slink away to SALLY;",
    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",
    "And she lives in our Alley.",
    "When Christmas comes about again,",
    "O then I shall have Money;",
    "I\u2019ll hoard it up, and Box and all",
    "I\u2019ll give it to my Honey:",
    "And, would it were ten thousand Pounds;",
    "I\u2019d give it all to SALLY;",
    "She is the Darling of my Heart,",

    "My Master and the Neighbours all,",
    "Make game of me and SALLY;",
    "And (but for her) I\u2019d better be",
    "A Slave and row a Galley:",
    "But when my seven long Years are out,",
    "O then I\u2019ll marry SALLY!",
    "O then we\u2019ll wed and then we\u2019ll bed,",
    "But not in our Alley."

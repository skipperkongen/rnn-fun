    "All summer, the city engine's low",
    "roar capsizes our bodies into sleep,",
    "groans,",
    "evacuation\u2014",
    "Lost to a watery",
    "anamnesis so warm it requires a raft",
    "thatched from death's",
    "flotsam to necklace its shore",
    "I swim on, calling your name",
    "In my dreams, something is always deserting",
    "But tonight, no fast shadows of birds",
    "No oceanic flowers disrobing butterflies",
    "or bright beach of child's porridge and bones\u2014",
    "Instead, someone weaving",
    "a net from fallen hair in and around our bed",
    "to catch the breath, blood, and ritual",
    "motions that oiled us",
    "as one candle in a cave",
    "In your dreams, someone is always resisting being saved",
    "you say I said",
    ", once",
    "I thought you were admonishing me to go away",
    "I don't remember most others, a thousand seasons",
    "phonographed in through a wounded window",
    "Just o.k. empty all the rice from my legs",
    "Once I awoke screaming, paws red-hot embers",
    "You opened my mouth and poured a night-cold river in",
    "Once you died and my heart fished all winter",
    "Once we were eating lunch inside a kiln",
    "Once you thought you smelled death,",
    "but the lavender farm was too large to shave",
    "On the fifth straight morning I'd dreamt of water",
    "I stared at your face, its nacreous lids,",
    "and I swear I could see a Glorious Ghost shifting",
    "over your sun-warm waves",
    "Water my birth sign, and one day my mother's death",
    "that protect-fills my love with sadness",
    "There, in words to my coworkers",
    "it was still dripping, in my nods",
    "over a galapagos of pages and forms",
    ", that autumn apparently",
    "I mumbled",
    "Your reply, after days:",
    "Somewhere right now, two lovers are conversing",
    "without even knowing what their lives mean",
    "One's heart gazelle-quick to survey a mountain his dead",
    "father is always vandalizing",
    "The other frequently misplacing her hair, ears, or self-",
    "sabotaging a crime",
    "One usually struggling to stay alive",
    "The other often untethering something",
    "Or is it my mitochondria that powder-sugars the moon?",
    "And you calcifying a promise inside to inscribe?",
    "There is a dominion where inverses",
    "invert until only terror, love, and imagination cling,",
    "heavy, on human branches\u2014enter your vista, phylum",
    "unsequenced, dimmer deeds",
    "Can you hear it tonight?",
    "Wind in iron jars buried inside the living:",
    "Grandmothers, past spouses, cable men, priests",
    "I finally manage",
    "as our train smokes out all the rats on their bed of leaves",
    "All night, I dive",
    "down to the soft structures of some blue civilization's faith",
    "In this myth of life, I keep forgetting whose ideas and",
    "sensations I'm supposed to be",
    "Come morning: rain, trees, silvery",
    "sleet",
    "and daily, this new fresh bounty",
    "we share, side by side",
    "like angels coming home from work at a pearl factory"

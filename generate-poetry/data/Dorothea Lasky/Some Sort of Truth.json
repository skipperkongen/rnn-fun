    "When my dad first started to die",
    "All my mom could remember",
    "Was the time he kicked her out",
    "After they first started dating",
    "So that he could go play golf",
    "It is the sort of thing we all remember",
    "When we feel death upon us",
    "I remember he died twice",
    "And once in my dream",
    "I just had to see him all nursed and swaddled as if he were sleeping",
    "But he wasn\u2019t sleeping",
    "I stood in the white light of the nursing home bathroom",
    "With the sun spilling everywhere on me",
    "And tried to talk to him, but never, he\u2019d never listen",
    "People don\u2019t always listen to you when they are dead",
    "But that\u2019s not sad",
    "I get tired",
    "And I don\u2019t listen to one Goddamn thing you are saying",
    "But that is because most of the time you bore me",
    "And when I am finally asleep it is really nice just to dream",
    "I have seen a lot of things in this life",
    "But one thing I saw most readily",
    "Was that despite his eternal heartbreak",
    "And girlish silliness",
    "Mike\u2019s face was kind of sweet, a sweet wind",
    "He is going to think it is weird that I put him in this poem",
    "But I don\u2019t think it is weird that I put him in this poem"

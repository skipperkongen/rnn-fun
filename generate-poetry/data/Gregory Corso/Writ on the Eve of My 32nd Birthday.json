    "The lips are the same.",
    "And the eyes, ah the eyes get better all the time.",
    "32 and no wife, no baby; no baby hurts,",
    "but there\u2019s lots of time.",

    "it might not make day my personal life,",
    "my association with people,",
    "or my behavior toward society,",
    "but it does tell me my soul has a shadow."

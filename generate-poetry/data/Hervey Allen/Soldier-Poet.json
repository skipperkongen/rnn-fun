    "I think at first like us he did not see",
    "The goal to which the screaming eagles flew;",
    "For romance lured him, France, and chivalry;",
    "But Oh! Before the end he knew, he knew!",
    "And gave his first full love to Liberty,",
    "And met her face to face one lurid night",
    "While the guns boomed their shuddering minstrelsy",
    "And all the Argonne glowed with demon light.",
    "And Liberty herself came through the wood,",
    "And with her dear, boy lover kept the tryst;",
    "Clasped in her grand, Greek arms he understood",
    "Whose were the fatal lips that he had kissed\u2014",
    "Lipes that the soul of Youth has loved from old\u2014",
    "Hot lips of Liberty that kiss men cold."

    "The mountains carry snow, the season fails.",
    "Jackstraw clapboard shivers on its nails,",
    "the freezing air blows maple leaves and dust,",
    "a thousand nails bleed laceries of rust,",
    "slates crack and slide away, the gutters sprout.",
    "I wonder: do a dead man\u2019s bones come out",
    "like these old lintels and wasp-riddled beams?",
    "I ask in simple consequence of structure seen",
    "in this old house, grown sturdy in its fall,",
    "the brace and bone of it come clear of all",
    "I took for substance, what I could not prove",
    "from any measure of design or love.",
    "Or is it rather that he falls away",
    "to no articulation but decay,",
    "however brightly leap the brass-hinged bone,",
    "beam and rafter, joist and cellar-stone?"

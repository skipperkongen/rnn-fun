    "A man stood in the laurel tree",
    "Adjusting his hands and feet to the boughs.",
    "He said, \u201cToday I was breaking stones",
    "On a mountain road in Asia,",
    "When suddenly I had a vision",
    "Of mankind, like grass and flowers,",
    "The same over all the earth.",
    "We forgave each other; we gave ourselves",
    "Wholly over to words.",
    "And straightway I was released",
    "And sprang through an open gate.\u201d",
    "I said, \u201cInto a meadow?\u201d",
    "He said, \u201cI am impervious to irony.",
    "I thank you for the word ...",
    "I am standing in a sunlit meadow.",
    "Know that everything your senses reject",
    "Springs up in the spiritual world.\u201d",
    "I said, \u201cOur scientists have another opinion.",
    "They say, you are merely phenomena.\u201d",
    "He said, \u201cOver here they will be angels",
    "Singing, Holy holy be His Name!",
    "And also, it works in reverse.",
    "Things which to us in the pure state are mysterious,",
    "Are your simplest articles of household use\u2014",
    "A chair, a dish, and meaner even than these,",
    "The very latest inventions.",
    "Machines are the animals of the Americans\u2014",
    "Tell me about machines.\u201d",
    "I said, \u201cI have suspected",
    "The Mixmaster knows more than I do,",
    "The air conditioner is the better poet.",
    "My right front tire is as bald as Odysseus\u2014",
    "How much it must have suffered!",
    "Then, as things have a third substance",
    "Which is obscure to both our senses,",
    "Let there be a perpetual coming and going",
    "Between your house and mine.\u201d"

    "Neither on horseback nor seated,",
    "But like himself, squarely on two feet,",
    "The poet of death and lilacs",

    "Where are you, Walt?",
    "The Open Road goes to the used-car lot.",

    "And those who have taken my moods for prophecies",
    "Mistake the matter.\u201d",
    "Then, vastly amused\u2014\u201cWhy do you reproach me?",
    "I freely confess I am wholly disreputable.",
    "Yet I am happy, because you found me out.\u201d",

    "Then all the realtors,",
    "Pickpockets, salesmen and the actors performing",
    "Official scenarios,",
    "Turned a deaf ear, for they had contracted",
    "American dreams.",
    "But the man who keeps a store on a lonely road,",
    "And the housewife who knows she\u2019s dumb,",

    "The future in ruins!",
    "The castles, the prisons, the cathedrals",
    "Unbuilding, and roses",
    "Blossoming from the stones that are not there . . .",
    "The clouds are lifting from the high Sierras,",
    "The Bay mists clearing,",
    "And the angel in the gate, the flowering plum,",
    "Dances like Italy, imagining red."

    "I\u2019ve carved a cave in the mountainside.",
    "I\u2019ve drilled for water, stocked provisions",
    "to last a lifetime. The walls are smooth.",
    "We can live here, love, safe from elements.",
    "We\u2019ll invent another love that can\u2019t destroy.",
    "We\u2019ll make exquisite reproductions of our",
    "selves, immortal on these walls.",
    "And when",
    "this sea that can\u2019t support us is burned clean,",
    "when the first new creatures crawl from it,",
    "gasping for water, air, more wondrous and more",
    "wild than earth\u2019s first couple, they shall see",
    "there were two before them: you and me."

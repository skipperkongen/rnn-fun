    "One morning",
    "they dig up the sidewalk and leave.",
    "No sign of the truck,",
    "only the large,",
    "dark shadow digging and digging,",
    "piling up sludge with a hand shovel",
    "beside the only tree.",
    "Two o\u2019clock I come by",
    "and he\u2019s slumbering in the grass beside rat holes.",
    "Three and he\u2019s stretched across a jagged stonewall,",
    "folded hands tucked beneath one ear\u2014",
    "a beautiful young boy smiling,",
    "not the heavy, large shadow who can\u2019t breathe.",
    "Four-thirty and the August heat",
    "takes one down here.",
    "He\u2019s pulled up an elbow joint",
    "some three feet round.",
    "At seven I head home for the night,",
    "pass the fresh gravel mound,",
    "a soft footprint near the manhole",
    "like the \u201cx\u201d",
    "would place beside his name",
    "all the years he couldn\u2019t write."

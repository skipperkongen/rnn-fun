    "After you\u2019ve learned to walk,",
    "Tell one thing from another,",
    "Your first care as a child",
    "Is to get used to your name.",
    "What is it?",
    "They keep asking you.",
    "You hesitate, stammer,",
    "And when you start to give a fluent answer",
    "Your name\u2019s no longer a problem.",
    "When you start to forget your name,",
    "It\u2019s very serious.",
    "But don\u2019t despair,",
    "An interval will set in.",
    "And soon after your death,",
    "When the mist rises from your eyes,",
    "And you begin to find your way",
    "In the everlasting darkness,",
    "Your first care (long forgotten,",
    "Long since buried with you)",
    "Is to get used to your name.",
    "You\u2019re called \u2014 just as arbitrarily \u2014",
    "Dandelion, cowslip, cornel,",
    "Blackbird, chaffinch, turtle dove,",
    "Costmary, zephyr \u2014 or all these together.",
    "And when you nod, to show you\u2019ve got it,",
    "Everything\u2019s all right:",
    "The earth, almost round, may spin",
    "Like a top among stars."

    "All the museums are afraid of me,",
    "Because each time I spend a whole day",
    "In front of a painting",
    "The next day they announce",
    "The painting\u2019s disappeared.",
    "Every night I\u2019m caught stealing",
    "In another part of the world,",
    "But I don\u2019t even care",
    "About the bullets hissing toward my ear,",
    "And the police dogs who are onto",
    "The smell of my tracks,",
    "Better than lovers who know",
    "The perfume of their mistress.",
    "I talk to the canvases that put my life in danger,",
    "Hang them from clouds and trees,",
    "Step back for some perspective.",
    "You can easily engage the Italian masters in conversation.",
    "What noise of colors!",
    "And hence I\u2019m caught",
    "Very quickly with them,",
    "Seen and heard from a distance",
    "As if I had a parrot in my arms.",
    "The hardest to steal is Rembrandt:",
    "Stretch a hand out, there\u2019s darkness \u2014",
    "The terror seizes you, his men don\u2019t have bodies,",
    "Just closed eyes in dark cellars.",
    "Van Gogh\u2019s canvases are insane,",
    "They whirl and roll their heads,",
    "And you have to hold on tight",
    "With both hands,",
    "They\u2019re sucked by a force from the moon.",
    "I don\u2019t know why, Breughel makes me want to cry.",
    "He wasn\u2019t any older than me,",
    "But they called him the old man",
    "Because he knew it all when he died.",
    "I try to learn from him too",
    "But can\u2019t stop my tears",
    "From flowing over the gold frames",
    "When I run off with The Four Seasons under my armpits.",
    "As I was saying, every night",
    "I steal one painting",
    "With enviable dexterity.",
    "But the road\u2019s very long",
    "So I\u2019m caught in the end",
    "And get home late at night",
    "Tired and torn to shreds by dogs",
    "Holding a cheap imitation in my hands."

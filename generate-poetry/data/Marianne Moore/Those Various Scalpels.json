    "Those",
    "various sounds, consistently indistinct, like intermingled echoes",
    "struck from thin glasses successively at random\u2014",
    "the inflection disguised: your hair, the tails of two",
    "fighting-cocks head to head in stone\u2014",
    "like sculptured scimitars repeating the curve of your",
    "ears in reverse order:",
    "your eyes,",
    "flowers of ice and snow",
    "sown by tearing winds on the cordage of disabled ships: your",
    "raised hand",
    "an ambiguous signature: your cheeks, those rosettes",
    "of blood on the stone floors of French ch\u00e2teaux,",
    "with regard to which the guides are so affirmative\u2014",
    "your other hand",
    "a bundle of lances all alike, partly hid by emeralds from Persia",
    "and the fractional magnificence of Florentine",
    "goldwork\u2014a collection of little objects\u2014",
    "sapphires set with emeralds, and pearls with a moonstone, made fine",
    "with enamel in gray, yellow, and dragonfly blue;",
    "a lemon, a pear",
    "and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver: your dress, a magnificent square",
    "cathedral tower of uniform",
    "and at the same time diverse appearance\u2014a",
    "species of vertical vineyard, rustling in the storm",
    "of conventional opinion\u2014are they weapons or scalpels?",
    "Whetted to brilliance",
    "by the hard majesty of that sophistication which is superior to opportunity,",
    "these things are rich instruments with which to experiment.",
    "But why dissect destiny with instruments",
    "more highly specialized than the components of destiny",
    "itself?"

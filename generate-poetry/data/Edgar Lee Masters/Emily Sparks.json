    "Where is my boy, my boy\u2014",
    "In what far part of the world?",

    "Of the beautiful love of Christ?",
    "And whether you ever took it or not,",
    "My boy, wherever you are,",
    "Work for your soul\u2019s sake,",
    "That all the clay of you, all the dross of you,",
    "May yield to the fire of you,",
    "Till the fire is nothing but light! . . .",
    "Nothing but light!"

    "Ye aspiring ones, listen to the story of the unknown",
    "Who lies here with no stone to mark the place.",
    "As a boy reckless and wanton,",
    "Wandering with gun in hand through the forest",
    "Near the mansion of Aaron Hatfield,",
    "I shot a hawk perched on the top",
    "Of a dead tree.",
    "He fell with guttural cry",
    "At my feet, his wing broken.",
    "Then I put him in a cage",
    "Where he lived many days cawing angrily at me",
    "When I offered him food.",
    "Daily I search the realms of Hades",
    "For the soul of the hawk,",
    "That I may offer him the friendship",
    "Of one whom life wounded and caged."

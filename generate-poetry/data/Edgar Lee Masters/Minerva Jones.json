    "I am Minerva, the village poetess,",
    "Hooted at, jeered at by the Yahoos of the street",
    "For my heavy body, cock-eye, and rolling walk,",
    "And all the more when \u201cButch\u201d Weldy",
    "Captured me after a brutal hunt.",
    "He left me to my fate with Doctor Meyers;",
    "And I sank into death, growing numb from the feet up,",
    "Like one stepping deeper and deeper into a stream of ice.",
    "Will some one go to the village newspaper,",
    "And gather into a book the verses I wrote?\u2014",
    "I thirsted so for love",
    "I hungered so for life!"

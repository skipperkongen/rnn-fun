    "I was only eight years old;",
    "And before I grew up and knew what it meant",
    "I had no words for it, except",
    "That I was frightened and told my",
    "Mother; And that my Father got a pistol",
    "And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,",
    "Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.",
    "Nevertheless the story clung to me.",
    "But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,",
    "Was a newcomer and never heard it",
    "Till two years after we were married.",
    "Then he considered himself cheated,",
    "And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.",
    "Well, he deserted me, and I died",
    "The following winter."

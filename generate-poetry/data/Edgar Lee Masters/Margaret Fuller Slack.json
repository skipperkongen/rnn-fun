    "I would have been as great as George Eliot",
    "But for an untoward fate.",

    "Gray, too, and far-searching.",
    "But there was the old, old problem:",
    "Should it be celibacy, matrimony or unchastity?",
    "Then John Slack, the rich druggist, wooed me,",
    "Luring me with the promise of leisure for my novel,",
    "And I married him, giving birth to eight children,",
    "And had no time to write.",
    "It was all over with me, anyway,",
    "When I ran the needle in my hand",
    "While washing the baby's things,",
    "And died from lock-jaw, an ironical death.",
    "Hear me, ambitious souls,",
    "Sex is the curse of life!"

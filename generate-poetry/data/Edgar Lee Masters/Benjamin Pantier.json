    "Together in this grave lie Benjamin Pantier, attorney at law,",
    "And Nig, his dog, constant companion, solace and friend.",
    "Down the gray road, friends, children, men and women,",
    "Passing one by one out of life, left me till I was alone",
    "With Nig for partner, bed-fellow, comrade in drink.",
    "In the morning of life I knew aspiration and saw glory.",
    "Then she, who survives me, snared my soul",
    "With a snare which bled me to death,",
    "Till I, once strong of will, lay broken, indifferent,",
    "Living with Nig in a room back of a dingy office.",
    "Under my jaw-bone is snuggled the bony nose of Nig \u2014",
    "Our story is lost in silence. Go by, mad world!"

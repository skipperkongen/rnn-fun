    "Not in that wasted garden",
    "Where bodies are drawn into grass",
    "That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens",
    "That bear no fruit \u2014",
    "There where along the shaded walks",
    "Vain sighs are heard,",
    "And vainer dreams are dreamed",
    "Of close communion with departed souls \u2014",
    "But here under the apple tree",
    "I loved and watched and pruned",
    "With gnarled hands",
    "In the long, long years;",
    "Here under the roots of this northern-spy",
    "To move in the chemic change and circle of life,",
    "Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,",
    "And into the living epitaphs",
    "Of redder apples!"

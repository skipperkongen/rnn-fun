    "Late, I have come to a parched land",
    "doubting my gift, if gift I have,",
    "the inspiration of water",
    "spilt, swallowed in the sand.",
    "To hear once more water trickle,",
    "to stand in a stretch of silence",
    "the divining pen twisting in the hand:",
    "sign of depths alluvial.",
    "Water owns no permanent shape,",
    "sags, is most itself descending;",
    "now, under the shadow of the idol,",
    "dry mouth and dry landscape.",
    "No rain falls with a refreshing sound",
    "to settle tubular in a well,",
    "elliptical in a bowl. No grape",
    "lusciously moulds it round.",
    "Clouds have no constant resemblance",
    "to anything, blown by a hot wind,",
    "flying mirages; the blue background,",
    "light constructions of chance.",
    "To hold back chaos I transformed",
    "amorphous mass\u2014and fire and cloud\u2014",
    "so that the ag\u00e8d gods might dance",
    "and golden structures form.",
    "I should have built, plain brick on brick,",
    "a water tower. The sun flies on",
    "arid wastes, barren hells too warm",
    "and me with a hazel stick!",
    "Rivulets vanished in the dust",
    "long ago, great compositions",
    "vaporized, salt on the tongue so thick",
    "that drinking, still I thirst.",
    "Repeated desert, recurring drought,",
    "sometimes hearing water trickle,",
    "sometimes not, I, by doubting first,",
    "believe; believing, doubt."

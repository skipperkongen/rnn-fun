    "(Dr Wilfred Abse)",
    "Sister saying\u2014\u2018Soon you\u2019ll be back in the ward,\u2019",
    "sister thinking\u2014\u2018Only two more on the list,\u2019",
    "the patient saying\u2014\u2018Thank you, I feel fine\u2019;",
    "small voices, small lies, nothing untoward,",
    "though, soon, he would blink again and again",
    "because of the fingers of Lambert Rogers,",
    "rash as a blind man\u2019s, inside his soft brain.",
    "If items of horror can make a man laugh",
    "then laugh at this: one hour later, the growth",
    "still undiscovered, ticking its own wild time;",
    "more brain mashed because of the probe\u2019s braille path;",
    "Lambert Rogers desperate, fingering still;",
    "his dresser thinking, \u2018Christ! Two more on the list,",
    "a cisternal puncture and a neural cyst.\u2019",
    "Then, suddenly, the cracked record in the brain,",
    "a ventriloquist voice that cried, \u2018You sod,",
    "leave my soul alone, leave my soul alone,\u2019\u2014",
    "the patient\u2019s dummy lips moving to that refrain,",
    "the patient\u2019s eyes too wide. And, shocked,",
    "Lambert Rogers drawing out the probe",
    "with nurses, students, sister, petrified.",
    "\u2018Leave my soul alone, leave my soul alone,\u2019",
    "that voice so arctic and that cry so odd",
    "had nowhere else to go\u2014till the antique",
    "gramophone wound down and the words began",
    "to blur and slow, \u2018 \u2026 leave \u2026 my \u2026 soul \u2026 alone \u2026 \u2019",
    "to cease at last when something other died.",
    "And silence matched the silence under snow."

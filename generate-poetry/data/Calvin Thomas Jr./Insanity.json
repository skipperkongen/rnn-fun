    "The quick-sliding cape of mind",
    "Drags wrinkled on a dusty floor,",
    "A party dress,",
    "Sagging from those shoulders",
    "of a smile",
    "that stalks through crooked time",
    "followed by a goat",
    "nipping the petticoat.",
    "Scape-goat, grin out loud.",
    "Make the cloak a shroud.",
    "He whinnys through the nose,",
    "paws the trailing hem",
    "and strikes a fawning pose.",
    "Tight-clamped, the clasp of tin",
    "Tears cloth it won\u2019t undo.",
    "Before the gown slips down.",
    "A rent . . . which lets the darkness through."

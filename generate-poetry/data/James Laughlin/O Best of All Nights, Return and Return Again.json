    "How she let her long hair down over her shoulders, making a love cave around her face. Return and return again.",
    "How when the lamplight was lowered she pressed against him, twining her fingers in his. Return and return again.",
    "How their legs swam together like dolphins and their toes played like little tunnies. Return and return again.",
    "How she sat beside him cross-legged, telling him stories of her childhood. Return and return again.",
    "How she closed her eyes when his were open, how they breathed together, breathing each other. Return and return again.",
    "How they fell into slumber, their bodies curled together like two spoons. Return and return again.",
    "How they went together to Otherwhere, the fairest land they had ever seen. Return and return again.",
    "O best of all nights, return and return again."

    "Am I a character in the dreams",
    "of the god Hermes the messenger?",
    "Certainly many of my dreams",
    "have nothing to do with the",
    "common life around me. There",
    "are never any automobiles or",
    "airplanes in them. These",
    "dreams belong to an age in",
    "the distant past, to a time",
    "perhaps when nothing was",
    "written down, to the",
    "time of memory.",
    "I chose Hermes not out of",
    "vanity but because from what",
    "I\u2019ve read about him he had a",
    "pretty good time, was not",
    "just a drunkard on Olympus.",
    "In his traipsings delivering",
    "divine messages he must have",
    "met some pretty girls who",
    "gave him pleasure. We know",
    "that he invented the lyre",
    "for the benefit of poets,",
    "and Lucian relates in his",
    "that",
    "he was the god of sleep",
    "and dreams.",
    "My dreams are not frightening,",
    "they are not nightmares. But",
    "their irrationality puzzles",
    "me. What is Hermes trying to",
    "tell me? Is he playing a game",
    "with me? Last Monday night",
    "I dreamt about a school for",
    "young children who had heads",
    "but no bodies. Last night it",
    "was a cow that was galloping",
    "in our meadow like a horse.",
    "Another night, and this one",
    "was a bit scary, I swam across",
    "the lake with my head under",
    "water, I didn\u2019t have to breathe air.",
    "What is the message of these",
    "dreams? Into what kind of world",
    "is Hermes leading me? It\u2019s not",
    "the world described daily in the",
    ". A world of",
    "shadows? A kind of levitation?",
    "How can I pray to Hermes to lay",
    "off these senseless fantasies,",
    "tell him that I want",
    "dreams",
    "such as my shrink can explicate.",
    "I\u2019ve looked up lustration in",
    "the dictionary. Its definition",
    "is not encouraging: \u201ca prefatory",
    "ceremony, performed as a preliminary",
    "to entering a holy place.\u201d That\u2019s",
    "too impersonal. I want a man-to-man",
    "talk with Hermes, telling him to",
    "stop infesting my nights with",
    "his nonsense."

    "Michael O\u2019Toole hated going to school,",
    "He wanted to stay home and play.",
    "So lied to his dad and said he felt bad",
    "And stayed home from school one day.",
    "The very next day he decided to say",
    "That his stomach felt a bit queasy.",
    "He groaned and he winced \u2019til his dad was convinced,",
    "And he said to himself, \u201cThis is easy!\u201d",
    "At the end of the week, his dad kissed his cheek",
    "And said, \u201cSon, you\u2019ve missed too much school.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut still I feel funny, and my nose is all runny,\u201d",
    "Said the mischievous Michael O\u2019Toole.",
    "Each day he\u2019d complain of a new ache or pain,",
    "But his doctor could find nothing wrong.",
    "He said it was best to let Michael rest,",
    "Until he felt healthy and strong.",
    "Michael O\u2019Toole never did get to school,",
    "So he never learned how to write\u2014",
    "Or to read or to spell or do anything well,",
    "Which is sad, for he\u2019s really quite bright.",
    "And now that he\u2019s grown, he sits home alone",
    "\u2019Cause there\u2019s nothing he knows how to do.",
    "Don't be a fool and stay home from school,",
    "Or the same thing could happen to you!"

    "In childhood Christy and I played in the dumpster across the street",
    "from Pickett & Sons Construction. When we found bricks, it was best.",
    "Bricks were most useful. We drug them to our empty backyard",
    "and stacked them in the shape of a room. For months",
    "we collected bricks, one on top another. When the walls",
    "reached as high as my younger sister\u2019s head, we laid down.",
    "Hiding in the middle of our room, we watched the cycle",
    "of the sun, gazed at the stars, clutched hands and felt at home."

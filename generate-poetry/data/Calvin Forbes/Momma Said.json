    "The slice I ate I want it back",
    "Those crumbs I swept up",
    "I\u2019d like my share again",
    "I can still taste it like it was",
    "The memory by itself is delicious",
    "Each bite was a small miracle",
    "Both nourishing and sweet",
    "I wish I had saved just a little bit",
    "I know it wasn\u2019t a literal cake",
    "It\u2019s the thought that counts",
    "Like a gift that\u2019s not store-bought",
    "Making it even more special",
    "Like a dream that makes you",
    "Want to go back to sleep",
    "You can\u2019t have your cake",
    "And eat it too Momma said",
    "I was defiant and hardheaded",
    "And answered yes I can too",
    "The look she gave me said boy",
    "I hope you aren\u2019t a fool all your life"

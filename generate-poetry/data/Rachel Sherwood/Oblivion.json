    "I poured a whiskey and soda",
    "watching the tree outside dissolve:",
    "light going backward pushed to corners",
    "to the white sliver of wood",
    "around the door.",
    "I recall the banks menaced by wasps",
    "swollen on summer sap, a cement hollow",
    "stuck with their strange cradles",
    "a woozy stench of damp clay",
    "the blunt poison of water snakes.",
    "my glass is hollow:",
    "the door is luminous",
    "like a firefly at midnight."

    "As this suburban summer wanders toward dark",
    "the chattering of awful boys as they plot",
    "behind the juniper and ivy, miniature guerillas",
    "that mimic the ancient news of the world",
    "and shout threats, piped high across mock fences",
    "to girls riding by in the last pieces of light",
    "a man across the street laughs through an open door",
    "utterly alien, alone. There is a time, seconds between",
    "the last light and the dark stretch ahead, when color",
    "is lost \u2014 the girl on her swing becomes a swift",
    "apparition, black and white flowing suddenly into night."

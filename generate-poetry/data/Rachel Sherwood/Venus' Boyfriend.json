    "She sat on his lap for hours",
    "pressed his face to her",
    "large pink breasts her hands",
    "moved through his hair",
    "like fond snakes",
    "hooves beneath the flesh",
    "marvellous flesh, and smooth shoulders",
    "how to use his tongue",
    "to shape a heart",
    "from a piece of ice."

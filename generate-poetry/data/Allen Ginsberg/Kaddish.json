    "Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes, while I walk on the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village.",
    "downtown Manhattan, clear winter noon, and I\u2019ve been up all night, talking, talking, reading the Kaddish aloud, listening to Ray Charles blues shout blind on the phonograph",
    "the rhythm the rhythm\u2014and your memory in my head three years after\u2014And read Adonais\u2019 last triumphant stanzas aloud\u2014wept, realizing how we suffer\u2014",
    "And how Death is that remedy all singers dream of, sing, remember, prophesy as in the Hebrew Anthem, or the Buddhist Book of Answers\u2014and my own imagination of a withered leaf\u2014at dawn\u2014",
    "Dreaming back thru life, Your time\u2014and mine accelerating toward Apocalypse,",
    "the final moment\u2014the flower burning in the Day\u2014and what comes after,",
    "looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city",
    "a flash away, and the great dream of Me or China, or you and a phantom Russia, or a crumpled bed that never existed\u2014",
    "like a poem in the dark\u2014escaped back to Oblivion\u2014",
    "No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream, trapped in its disappearance,",
    "sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, worshipping each other,",
    "worshipping the God included in it all\u2014longing or inevitability?\u2014while it lasts, a Vision\u2014anything more?",
    "It leaps about me, as I go out and walk the street, look back over my shoulder, Seventh Avenue, the battlements of window office buildings shouldering each other high, under a cloud, tall as the sky an instant\u2014and the sky above\u2014an old blue place.",
    "or down the Avenue to the south, to\u2014as I walk toward the Lower East Side\u2014where you walked 50 years ago, little girl\u2014from Russia, eating the first poisonous tomatoes of America\u2014frightened on the dock\u2014",
    "then struggling in the crowds of Orchard Street toward what?\u2014toward Newark\u2014",
    "toward candy store, first home-made sodas of the century, hand-churned ice cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards\u2014",
    "Toward education marriage nervous breakdown, operation, teaching school, and learning to be mad, in a dream\u2014what is this life?",
    "Toward the Key in the window\u2014and the great Key lays its head of light on top of Manhattan, and over the floor, and lays down on the sidewalk\u2014in a single vast beam, moving, as I walk down First toward the Yiddish Theater\u2014and the place of poverty",
    "you knew, and I know, but without caring now\u2014Strange to have moved",
    "thru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again,",
    "with the cries of Spaniards now in the doorstoops doors and dark boys on the street, fire escapes old as you",
    "-Tho you\u2019re not old now, that\u2019s left here with me\u2014",
    "Myself, anyhow, maybe as old as the universe\u2014and I guess that dies with us\u2014enough to cancel all that comes\u2014What came is gone forever every time\u2014",
    "That\u2019s good! That leaves it open for no regret\u2014no fear radiators, lacklove, torture even toothache in the end\u2014",
    "Though while it comes it is a lion that eats the soul\u2014and the lamb, the soul, in us, alas, offering itself in sacrifice to change\u2019s fierce hunger\u2014hair and teeth\u2014and the roar of bonepain, skull bare, break rib, rot-skin, braintricked Implacability.",
    "Ai! ai! we do worse! We are in a fix! And you\u2019re out, Death let you out, Death had the Mercy, you\u2019re done with your century, done with God, done with the path thru it\u2014Done with yourself at last\u2014Pure\u2014Back to the Babe dark before your Father, before us all\u2014before the world\u2014",
    "There, rest. No more suffering for you. I know where you\u2019ve gone, it\u2019s good.",
    "No more flowers in the summer fields of New York, no joy now, no more fear of Louis,",
    "and no more of his sweetness and glasses, his high school decades, debts, loves, frightened telephone calls, conception beds, relatives, hands\u2014",
    "No more of sister Elanor,.\u2014she gone before you\u2014we kept it secret\u2014you killed her\u2014or she killed herself to bear with you\u2014an arthritic heart\u2014But Death\u2019s killed you both\u2014No matter\u2014",
    "Nor your memory of your mother, 1915 tears in silent movies weeks and weeks\u2014forgetting, aggrieve watching Marie Dressler address humanity, Chaplin dance in youth,",
    "or Boris Godunov, Chaliapin\u2019s at the Met, hailing his voice of a weeping Czar\u2014by standing room with Elanor & Max\u2014watching also the Capitalists take seats in Orchestra, white furs, diamonds,",
    "with the YPSL\u2019s hitch-hiking thru Pennsylvania, in black baggy gym skirts pants, photograph of 4 girls holding each other round the waste, and laughing eye, too coy, virginal solitude of 1920",
    "all girls grown old, or dead, now, and that long hair in the grave\u2014lucky to have husbands later\u2014",
    "You made it\u2014I came too\u2014Eugene my brother before (still grieving now and will gream on to his last stiff hand, as he goes thru his cancer\u2014or kill\u2014later perhaps\u2014soon he will think\u2014)",
    "And it\u2019s the last moment I remember, which I see them all, thru myself, now\u2014tho not you",
    "I didn\u2019t foresee what you felt\u2014what more hideous gape of bad mouth came first\u2014to you\u2014and were you prepared?",
    "To go where? In that Dark\u2014that\u2014in that God? a radiance? A Lord in the Void? Like an eye in the black cloud in a dream? Adonoi at last, with you?",
    "Beyond my remembrance! Incapable to guess! Not merely the yellow skull in the grave, or a box of worm dust, and a stained ribbon\u2014Deathshead with Halo? can you believe it?",
    "Is it only the sun that shines once for the mind, only the flash of existence, than none ever was?",
    "Nothing beyond what we have\u2014what you had\u2014that so pitiful\u2014yet Triumph,",
    "to have been here, and changed, like a tree, broken, or flower\u2014fed to the ground\u2014but mad, with its petals, colored, thinking Great Universe, shaken, cut in the head, leaf stript, hid in an egg crate hospital, cloth wrapped, sore\u2014freaked in the moon brain, Naughtless.",
    "No flower like that flower, which knew itself in the garden, and fought the knife\u2014lost",
    "Cut down by an idiot Snowman\u2019s icy\u2014even in the Spring\u2014strange ghost thought\u2014some Death\u2014Sharp icicle in his hand\u2014crowned with old roses\u2014a dog for his eyes\u2014cock of a sweatshop\u2014heart of electric irons.",
    "All the accumulations of life, that wear us out\u2014clocks, bodies, consciousness, shoes, breasts\u2014begotten sons\u2014your Communism\u2014\u2018Paranoia\u2019 into hospitals.",
    "You once kicked Elanor in the leg, she died of heart failure later. You of stroke. Asleep? within a year, the two of you, sisters in death. Is Elanor happy?",
    "Max grieves alive in an office on Lower Broadway, lone large mustache over midnight Accountings, not sure. l His life passes\u2014as he sees\u2014and what does he doubt now? Still dream of making money, or that might have made money, hired nurse, had children, found even your Immortality, Naomi?",
    "I\u2019ll see him soon. Now I\u2019ve got to cut through\u2014to talk to you\u2014as I didn\u2019t when you had a mouth.",
    "Forever. And we\u2019re bound for that, Forever\u2014like Emily Dickinson\u2019s horses\u2014headed to the End.",
    "They know the way\u2014These Steeds\u2014run faster than we think\u2014it\u2019s our own life they cross\u2014and take with them.",
    "Magnificent, mourned no more, marred of heart, mind behind, married dreamed, mortal changed\u2014Ass and face done with murder.",
    "In the world, given, flower maddened, made no Utopia, shut under pine, almed in Earth, balmed in Lone, Jehovah, accept.",
    "Nameless, One Faced, Forever beyond me, beginningless, endless, Father in death. Tho I am not there for this Prophecy, I am unmarried, I\u2019m hymnless, I\u2019m Heavenless, headless in blisshood I would still adore",
    "Thee, Heaven, after Death, only One blessed in Nothingness, not light or darkness, Dayless Eternity\u2014",
    "Take this, this Psalm, from me, burst from my hand in a day, some of my Time, now given to Nothing\u2014to praise Thee\u2014But Death",
    "This is the end, the redemption from Wilderness, way for the Wonderer, House sought for All, black handkerchief washed clean by weeping\u2014page beyond Psalm\u2014Last change of mine and Naomi\u2014to God\u2019s perfect Darkness\u2014Death, stay thy phantoms!",
    "Over and over\u2014refrain\u2014of the Hospitals\u2014still haven\u2019t written your history\u2014leave it abstract\u2014a few images",
    "run thru the mind\u2014like the saxophone chorus of houses and years\u2014remembrance of electrical shocks.",
    "By long nites as a child in Paterson apartment, watching over your nervousness\u2014you were fat\u2014your next move\u2014",
    "By that afternoon I stayed home from school to take care of you\u2014once and for all\u2014when I vowed forever that once man disagreed with my opinion of the cosmos, I was lost\u2014",
    "By my later burden\u2014vow to illuminate mankind\u2014this is release of particulars\u2014(mad as you)\u2014(sanity a trick of agreement)\u2014",
    "But you stared out the window on the Broadway Church corner, and spied a mystical assassin from Newark,",
    "So phoned the Doctor\u2014\u2018OK go way for a rest\u2019\u2014so I put on my coat and walked you downstreet\u2014On the way a grammarschool boy screamed, unaccountably\u2014\u2018Where you goin Lady to Death\u2019? I shuddered\u2014",
    "and you covered your nose with motheaten fur collar, gas mask against poison sneaked into downtown atmosphere, sprayed by Grandma\u2014",
    "And was the driver of the cheesebox Public Service bus a member of the gang? You shuddered at his face, I could hardly get you on\u2014to New York, very Times Square, to grab another Greyhound\u2014",
    "where we hung around 2 hours fighting invisible bugs and jewish sickness\u2014breeze poisoned by Roosevelt\u2014",

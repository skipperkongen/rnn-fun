    "Tonite I walked out of my red apartment door on East tenth street\u2019s dusk\u2014",
    "Walked out of my home ten years, walked out in my honking neighborhood",
    "Tonite at seven walked out past garbage cans chained to concrete anchors",
    "Walked under black painted fire escapes, giant castiron plate covering a hole in ground",
    "\u2014Crossed the street, traffic lite red, thirteen bus roaring by liquor store,",
    "past corner pharmacy iron grated, past Coca Cola & Mylai posters fading scraped on brick",
    "Past Chinese Laundry wood door\u2019d, & broken cement stoop steps For Rent hall painted green & purple Puerto Rican style",
    "Along E. 10th\u2019s glass splattered pavement, kid blacks & Spanish oiled hair adolescents\u2019 crowded house fronts\u2014",
    "Ah, tonite I walked out on my block NY City under humid summer sky Halloween,",
    "thinking what happened Timothy Leary joining brain police for a season?",
    "thinking what\u2019s all this Weathermen, secrecy & selfrighteousness beyond reason\u2014F.B.I. plots?",
    "Walked past a taxicab controlling the bottle strewn curb\u2014",
    "past young fellows with their umbrella handles & canes leaning against a ravaged Buick",
    "\u2014and as I looked at the crowd of kids on the stoop\u2014a boy stepped up, put his arm around my neck",
    "tenderly I thought for a moment, squeezed harder, his umbrella handle against my skull,",
    "and his friends took my arm, a young brown companion tripped his foot \u2019gainst my ankle\u2014",
    "as I went down shouting Om Ah H\u016b",
    "to gangs of lovers on the stoop watching",
    "slowly appreciating, why this is a raid, these strangers mean strange business",
    "with what\u2014my pockets, bald head, broken-healed-bone leg, my softshoes, my heart\u2014",
    "Have they knives? Om Ah H\u016b",
    "\u2014Have they sharp metal wood to shove in eye ear ass? Om Ah H\u016b",
    "& slowly reclined on the pavement, struggling to keep my woolen bag of poetry address calendar & Leary-lawyer notes hung from my shoulder",
    "dragged in my neat orlon shirt over the crossbar of a broken metal door",
    "dragged slowly onto the fire-soiled floor an abandoned store, laundry candy counter 1929\u2014",
    "now a mess of papers & pillows & plastic car seat covers cracked cockroach-corpsed ground\u2014",
    "my wallet back pocket passed over the iron foot step guard",
    "and fell out, stole by God Muggers\u2019 lost fingers, Strange\u2014",
    "Couldn\u2019t tell\u2014snakeskin wallet actually plastic, 70 dollars my bank money for a week,",
    "old broken wallet\u2014and dreary plastic contents\u2014Amex card & Manf. Hanover Trust Credit too\u2014business card from Mr. Spears British Home Minister Drug Squad\u2014my draft card\u2014membership ACLU & Naropa Institute Instructor\u2019s identification",
    "Om Ah H\u016b",
    "I continued chanting Om Ah H\u016b",
    "Putting my palm on the neck of an 18 year old boy fingering my back pocket crying \u201cWhere\u2019s the money\u201d",
    "\u201cOm Ah H\u016b",
    "there isn\u2019t any\u201d",
    "My card Chief Boo-Hoo Neo American Church New Jersey & Lower East Side",
    "Om Ah H\u016b",
    "\u2014what not forgotten crowded wallet\u2014Mobil Credit, Shell? old lovers addresses on cardboard pieces, booksellers calling cards\u2014",
    "\u2014\u201cShut up or we\u2019ll murder you\u201d\u2014\u201cOm Ah H\u016b",
    "take it easy\u201d",
    "Lying on the floor shall I shout more loud?\u2014the metal door closed on blackness",
    "one boy felt my broken healed ankle, looking for hundred dollar bills behind my stocking weren\u2019t even there\u2014a third boy untied my Seiko Hong Kong watch rough from right wrist leaving a clasp-prick skin tiny bruise",
    "\u201cShut up and we\u2019ll get out of here\u201d\u2014and so they left,",
    "as I rose from the cardboard mattress thinking Om Ah H\u016b",
    "didn\u2019t stop em enough,",
    "the tone of voice too loud\u2014my shoulder bag with 10,000 dollars full of poetry left on the broken floor\u2014"

    "Sometimes when my eyes are red",
    "I go up on top of the RCA Building",
    "and gaze at my world, Manhattan\u2014",
    "my buildings, streets I\u2019ve done feats in,",
    "lofts, beds, coldwater flats",
    "\u2014on Fifth Ave below which I also bear in mind,",
    "its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men",
    "walking the size of specks of wool\u2014",
    "Panorama of the bridges, sunrise over Brooklyn machine,",
    "sun go down over New Jersey where I was born",
    "& Paterson where I played with ants\u2014",
    "my later loves on 15th Street,",
    "my greater loves of Lower East Side,",
    "my once fabulous amours in the Bronx",
    "faraway\u2014",
    "paths crossing in these hidden streets,",
    "my history summed up, my absences",
    "and ecstasies in Harlem\u2014",
    "\u2014sun shining down on all I own",
    "in one eyeblink to the horizon",
    "in my last eternity\u2014",
    "matter is water.",
    "Sad,",
    "I take the elevator and go",
    "down, pondering,",
    "and walk on the pavements staring into all man\u2019s",
    "plateglass, faces,",
    "questioning after who loves,",
    "and stop, bemused",
    "in front of an automobile shopwindow",
    "standing lost in calm thought,",
    "traffic moving up & down 5th Avenue blocks behind me",
    "waiting for a moment when ...",
    "Time to go home & cook supper & listen to",
    "the romantic war news on the radio",
    "... all movement stops",
    "& I walk in the timeless sadness of existence,",
    "tenderness flowing thru the buildings,",
    "my fingertips touching reality\u2019s face,",
    "my own face streaked with tears in the mirror",
    "of some window\u2014at dusk\u2014",
    "where I have no desire\u2014",
    "for bonbons\u2014or to own the dresses or Japanese",
    "lampshades of intellection\u2014",
    "Confused by the spectacle around me,",
    "Man struggling up the street",
    "with packages, newspapers,",
    "ties, beautiful suits",
    "toward his desire",
    "Man, woman, streaming over the pavements",
    "red lights clocking hurried watches &",
    "movements at the curb\u2014",
    "And all these streets leading",
    "so crosswise, honking, lengthily,",
    "by avenues",
    "stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums",
    "thru such halting traffic",
    "screaming cars and engines",
    "so painfully to this",
    "countryside, this graveyard",
    "this stillness",
    "on deathbed or mountain",
    "once seen",
    "never regained or desired",
    "in the mind to come",
    "where all Manhattan that I\u2019ve seen must disappear."

    "Whether anger quickens a lagging stride,",
    "and periodic burn-offs in the forest",
    "revitalize exhausted soil and flora\u0097.",
    "Whether we should take pleasure in the wildcat",
    "jubilation of a lightning bolt",
    "that whips its silver vein of genesis",
    "through the night sky, flash-photo of a white",
    "birch upended, the root-system buckled",
    "to swollen thunderheads\u0097. And whether naming",
    "an offense amounts to sour grapes and common",
    "bitterness, or even the conceited nonsense",
    "of unwashed yahoo multitudes, a yawping",
    "insult to civilized behavior\u0097. Whether",
    "a July rainstorm, even when it drenches",
    "the unprepared pedestrian and befuddles",
    "traffic, might be extravagant, a joy,",
    "like the whoops and escalating bop glissandos",
    "of Gillespie\u2019s upraised horn, cascading pitches",
    "a countersong to meteoric chalk marks",
    "Perseids burn across the House of Leo\u0097.",
    "And whether peaceful ecstasy might float",
    "up from a fifteen-second avalanche",
    "reflected in the skier\u2019s goggles, his jacket",
    "a spark of scarlet on the topmost slope,",
    "waiting for the homeward track to clear."

    "1.",
    "It is cold enough for rain",
    "to coagulate and fall in heavy drops.",
    "Tonight a skin of ice will grow",
    "over the bones of the smallest bush,",
    "making it droop like the wrist",
    "of someone carrying a heavy suitcase. This moving on,",
    "from season to season, is exhausting",
    "and violent, the break from the Berlin Wall",
    "of winter especially. Like a frostbitten",
    "hand coming to life, I color",
    "first with warmth,",
    "then with pain. Thawing, letting",
    "the great powers go",
    "their own way, in rivers and in flesh,",
    "frightens me, as this day",
    "warns me of an icy night.",
    "2.",
    "Each year I am astonished",
    "at the havoc wrought",
    "on other lives: fathers",
    "made tiny by cancer;",
    "a mother swollen around",
    "a bad heart \"brought on by aggravation.\"",
    "To suffer is to do something new",
    "yet always the same\u2014",
    "a change of life",
    "from the sexual dread. Some women",
    "wish they were men, some men",
    "wish they were dead; still,",
    "there is coin in suffering . . .",
    "It makes us rich",
    "as Croesus in his golden tears,",
    "and we are rarely hated for it.",
    "This coin I store in a purse",
    "made of my mother's",
    "milk and flesh, which God says I must not mix.",
    "I use it instead to seek pleasure.",
    "3.",
    "Walking around with this thing in me",
    "all day, this loving cup",
    "full of jelly, waiting for you",
    "to come home\u2014seven o'clock,",
    "eight o'clock, eight-thirty . . .",
    "What could be more important",
    "than love? I can't imagine; you can.",
    "Not a good day, not about to get better.",
    "4.",
    "The bird comes complete",
    "with heart, liver, and neck-bone",
    "wrapped chastely in white paper.",
    "Still half-frozen,",
    "the legs are hard to separate.",
    "Inside, wax paper sticks to the ribs.",
    "I reach like a vet delivering pigs,",
    "or a boy finger-fucking a virgin.",
    "5.",
    "Air the same sweet",
    "temperature inside the house",
    "as outside the house.",
    "Stepping up from the cellar",
    "with an armful of sheets,",
    "I listen for the dirge of flies",
    "under the chittering birds,",
    "both painfully loud. There is a stridency",
    "that's stubborn in a life",
    "grown by inches: the fat",
    "little fingers of buds bursting;",
    "ugly ducklings; the slow war",
    "of day against night.",
    "As I pin the swelling sheets",
    "with clothespins damp and too",
    "narrow at the mouth, I wonder how",
    "flies know to come out",
    "to feed the birds, and feast themselves",
    "on the new stillborn, this stubborn",
    "great chain of being."

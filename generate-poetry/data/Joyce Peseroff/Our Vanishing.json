    "Thanks, no thanks, to eternal life. What pleasure",
    "watching my old house broken-beamed, grey",
    "elephant brought to its knees? White ash\u2014gone",

    "even the nuclear-proof cockroach in deep-freeze.",

    "the tape and movement looks the same, illustrating",
    "the end of time: things happen, but don't matter.",
    "And if Lethe strips you like a swimmer",
    "from his trunks, where will \"I\" be? If Heaven",
    "without you is Hell, how will I know? A forever",
    "of no-never-mind does not appeal, God's heart",
    "a cold, contracting cinder. Give me the white light,",
    "the slit of split-second calm, and knowing over is over."

    "You\u2019re clean shaven in this country",
    "where trees grow beards of moss,",
    "where even bank tellers",
    "look a little like banditos",
    "in vests as pungent as sweatsuits.",
    "Still, you prefer the vegetable air",
    "to almost any other place on the map.",
    "After the heart attack,",
    "you considered Paris\u2014",
    "the flying buttresses,",
    "the fractured light of its cathedrals;",
    "the entire city refined and otherworldly,",
    "ascending on its architectural wings\u2014",
    "but decided you had no use for glory,",
    "boulevards fur-lined",
    "with statues and expensive trees.",
    "You admit, on the whole,",
    "the towns in this country are ugly.",
    "One summer you drove toward Nicoya",
    "(a beautiful name that became your destination),",
    "expecting a fragrant town of mango trees",
    "but found cattle grazing in the plaza,",
    "rattling the tin plates",
    "in the ubiquitous Chinese restaurant.",
    "A Coca-Cola sign hung weathered and askew.",
    "That\u2019s perhaps why you like it,",
    "it\u2019s a country you can\u2019t count on,",
    "a country of misfits.",
    "Unable to take root in the mud,",
    "the twentieth century has failed miserably,",
    "creating neither factory nor industry",
    "but a thirst for soda pop;",
    "like cosmetic surgery,",
    "it is skin deep.",
    "The clock is stuck in the rain",
    "and the mud of four o\u2019clock.",
    "There\u2019s nothing to do but wait as if",
    "in a dry cave, a room with a view of the waterfall,",
    "pinned as you are beneath the downpour.",
    "The waiter bends over your cup",
    "without filling it,",
    "the storekeeper holds your change",
    "until the rain, hypnotic and dramatic,",
    "leaves the streets and the gutters,",
    "the balcony and the air greener, heavier\u2014",
    "mildew blooming in the closet where your shoes,",
    "powdered with a sea-green lichen,",
    "resembles old bronze,",
    "a pair of ancient goblets.",
    "While iguanas lounge in the attic",
    "(a prehistoric version of the domestic rat),",
    "the Office of the Ministry",
    "(a pink and crumbling building",
    "surrounded by dusty rose trees)",
    "prints more money to prop",
    "the flimsy flowered currency.",
    "You can\u2019t predict what your American",
    "dollars will bring by morning.",
    "In the hotel restaurant",
    "you meet the Undesirable American.",
    "He learns just enough of the local lingo",
    "to swing by, living on a dwindling account",
    "and, here and there, a real estate swindle.",
    "Or the pensionado who buys two cigars,",
    "offering you one the day",
    "his Social Security arrives.",
    "Like the cockroach, the displaced",
    "have crawled through the cracks",
    "and selected for themselves",
    "an agreeable niche.",
    "A place to start from scratch.",
    "They thrive in the vegetable air.",
    "You wonder how you\u2019ll survive,",
    "unfit, unable to work.",
    "Lacking the predatory skills,",
    "you\u2019ve stayed in the trees,",
    "a dreamer, all your life,",
    "even now wanting to believe",
    "a change of scenery",
    "will get you back on your feet.",
    "A brief hiatus in the vegetable air.",
    "Tonight, you walk along the damp streets,",
    "an average steak, a glass of wine",
    "swishing in your belly,",
    "to your small room wedged between",
    "a jukebox and a dance hall.",
    "There are so many things you can\u2019t change\u2014",
    "like the dull thrashing music.",
    "You draw the blinds, switch on the tiny cassette.",
    "Silence. The click of the tape.",
    "And then the familiar aria,",
    "rising like the moon,",
    "lifts you out of yourself,",
    "transporting you to another country",
    "where, for a moment, you travel light."

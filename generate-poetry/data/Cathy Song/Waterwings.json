    "The mornings are his,",
    "blue and white",
    "like the tablecloth at breakfast.",
    "He\u2019s happy in the house,",
    "a sweep of the spoon",
    "brings the birds under his chair.",
    "He sings and the dishes disappear.",
    "Or holding a crayon like a candle,",
    "he draws a circle.",
    "It is his hundredth dragonfly.",
    "Calling for more paper,",
    "this one is red-winged",
    "and like the others,",
    "he wills it to fly, simply",
    "by the unformed curve of his signature.",
    "Waterwings he calls them,",
    "the floats I strap to his arms.",
    "I wear an apron of concern,",
    "sweep the morning of birds.",
    "To the water he returns,",
    "plunging where it\u2019s cold,",
    "moving and squealing into sunlight.",
    "The water from here seems flecked with gold.",
    "I watch the circles",
    "his small body makes",
    "fan and ripple,",
    "disperse like an echo",
    "into the sum of water, light and air.",
    "His imprint on the water",
    "has but a brief lifespan,",
    "the flicker of a dragonfly\u2019s delicate wing.",
    "This is sadness, I tell myself,",
    "the morning he chooses to leave his wings behind,",
    "because he will not remember",
    "that he and beauty were aligned,",
    "skimming across the water, nearly airborne,",
    "on his first solo flight.",
    "I\u2019ll write \u201chow he could not",
    "contain his delight.\u201d",
    "At the other end,",
    "in another time frame,",
    "he waits for me\u2014",
    "having already outdistanced this body,",
    "the one that slipped from me like a fish,",
    "floating, free of itself."

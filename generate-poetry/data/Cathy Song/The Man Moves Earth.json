    "The man moves earth",
    "to dispel grief.",

    "the size of cars.",
    "In proportion to what is taken",
    "what is given multiplies\u2014",
    "rain-swollen ponds",
    "and dirt mounds",
    "rooted with flame-tipped flowers.",
    "He carries trees like children",
    "struggling to be set down.",
    "Trees that have lived",
    "out their lives,",
    "he cuts and stacks",

    "In proportion to what is taken",
    "what is given multiplies\u2014",
    "the task of something",
    "else to clean.",
    "Gleaming appliances",
    "beg to be smudged,",
    "breathed upon by small children",
    "and large animals",
    "flicking out hope",
    "as she whirls by,",
    "flap of tongue,",
    "scratch of paw,",
    "sweetly reminding her.",
    "The man moves earth,",
    "the woman sweeps air.",
    "Together they pull water",
    "out of the other,",
    "pull with the muscular",
    "ache of the living,",
    "hauling from the deep",
    "well of the body",
    "the rain-swollen,",
    "the flame-tipped,",
    "the milk-fed\u2014",
    "all that cycles",
    "through lives moving,",
    "lives sweeping, water",
    "circulating between them",
    "like breath,",
    "drawn out of leaves by light."

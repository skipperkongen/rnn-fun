    "I wrap the blue towel",
    "after washing,",
    "around the damp",
    "weight of hair, bulky",
    "as a sleeping cat,",
    "and sit out on the porch.",
    "Still dripping water,",
    "it\u2019ll be dry by supper,",
    "by the time the dust",
    "settles off your shoes,",
    "though it\u2019s only five",
    "past noon. Think",
    "of the luxury: how to use",
    "the afternoon like the stretch",
    "of lawn spread before me.",
    "There\u2019s the laundry,",
    "sun-warm clothes at twilight,",
    "and the mountain of beans",
    "in my lap. Each one,",
    "I\u2019ll break and snap",
    "thoughtfully in half.",
    "But there is this slow arousal.",
    "The small buttons",
    "of my cotton blouse",
    "are pulling away from my body.",
    "I feel the strain of threads,",
    "the swollen magnolias",
    "heavy as a flock of birds",
    "in the tree. Already,",
    "the orange sponge cake",
    "is rising in the oven.",
    "I know you\u2019ll say it makes",
    "your mouth dry",
    "and I\u2019ll watch you",
    "drench your slice of it",
    "in canned peaches",
    "and lick the plate clean.",
    "So much hair, my mother",
    "used to say, grabbing",
    "the thick braided rope",
    "in her hands while we washed",
    "the breakfast dishes, discussing",
    "dresses and pastries.",
    "My mind often elsewhere",
    "as we did the morning chores together.",
    "Sometimes, a few strands",
    "would catch in her gold ring.",
    "I worked hard then,",
    "anticipating the hour",
    "when I would let the rope down",
    "at night, strips of sheets,",
    "knotted and tied,",
    "while she slept in tight blankets.",
    "My hair, freshly washed",
    "like a measure of wealth,",
    "like a bridal veil.",
    "Crouching in the grass,",
    "you would wait for the signal,",
    "for the movement of curtains",
    "before releasing yourself",
    "from the shadow of moths.",
    "Cloth, hair and hands,",
    "smuggling you in."

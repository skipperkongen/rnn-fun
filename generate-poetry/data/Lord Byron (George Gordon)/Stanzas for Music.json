    "There be none of Beauty's daughters",
    "With a magic like thee;",
    "And like music on the waters",
    "Is thy sweet voice to me:",
    "When, as if its sound were causing",
    "The charmed ocean's pausing,",
    "The waves lie still and gleaming,",
    "And the lull'd winds seem dreaming:",
    "And the midnight moon is weaving",
    "Her bright chain o'er the deep;",
    "Whose breast is gently heaving,",
    "As an infant's asleep:",
    "So the spirit bows before thee,",
    "To listen and adore thee;",
    "With a full but soft emotion,",
    "Like the swell of Summer's ocean."

    "No, nor a fierce hurrah",
    "for what it does without choice,",
    "for following the light",
    "for the same reason the light follows it.",
    "Just a thing rough to the touch, a face",
    "like a thousand ticks turning their backs,",
    "suckling at something you can\u2019t see,",
    "and a body like a tag off the earth",
    "so that my child hands couldn\u2019t tear it out",
    "from the overgrown lot next door.",
    "My palms raw with the shock",
    "of quills and spines. Its hold like spite, and ugly",
    "except when seen from a distance\u2014",
    "a whole field of them by the highway,",
    "an 80-mile-per-hour view",
    "like a camera\u2019s flash.",
    "All of them like halos",
    "without saints to weigh them down."

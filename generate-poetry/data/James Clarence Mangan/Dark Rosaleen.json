    "O my dark Rosaleen,",
    "Do not sigh, do not weep!",
    "The priests are on the ocean green,",
    "They march along the deep.",
    "There\u2019s wine from the royal Pope,",
    "Upon the ocean green;",
    "And Spanish ale shall give you hope,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My own Rosaleen!",
    "Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope,",
    "Shall give you health, and help, and hope,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "Over hills, and thro\u2019 dales,",
    "Have I roam\u2019d for your sake;",
    "All yesterday I sail\u2019d with sails",
    "On river and on lake.",
    "The Erne, at its highest flood,",
    "I dash\u2019d across unseen,",
    "For there was lightning in my blood,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My own Rosaleen!",
    "O, there was lightning in my blood,",
    "Red lighten\u2019d thro\u2019 my blood.",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "All day long, in unrest,",
    "To and fro, do I move.",
    "The very soul within my breast",
    "Is wasted for you, love!",
    "The heart in my bosom faints",
    "To think of you, my Queen,",
    "My life of life, my saint of saints,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My own Rosaleen!",
    "To hear your sweet and sad complaints,",
    "My life, my love, my saint of saints,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "Woe and pain, pain and woe,",
    "Are my lot, night and noon,",
    "To see your bright face clouded so,",
    "Like to the mournful moon.",
    "But yet will I rear your throne",
    "Again in golden sheen;",
    "\u2018Tis you shall reign, shall reign alone,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My own Rosaleen!",
    "\u2018Tis you shall have the golden throne,",
    "\u2018Tis you shall reign, and reign alone,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "Over dews, over sands,",
    "Will I fly, for your weal:",
    "Your holy delicate white hands",
    "Shall girdle me with steel.",
    "At home, in your emerald bowers,",
    "From morning\u2019s dawn till e\u2019en,",
    "You\u2019ll pray for me, my flower of flowers,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My fond Rosaleen!",
    "You\u2019ll think of me through daylight hours",
    "My virgin flower, my flower of flowers,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "I could scale the blue air,",
    "I could plough the high hills,",
    "Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer,",
    "To heal your many ills!",
    "And one beamy smile from you",
    "Would float like light between",
    "My toils and me, my own, my true,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My fond Rosaleen!",
    "Would give me life and soul anew,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "O, the Erne shall run red,",
    "With redundance of blood,",
    "The earth shall rock beneath our tread,",
    "And flames wrap hill and wood,",
    "And gun-peal and slogan-cry",
    "Wake many a glen serene,",
    "Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!",
    "My own Rosaleen!",
    "The Judgement Hour must first be nigh,",
    "Ere you can fade, ere you can die,",
    "My Dark Rosaleen!"

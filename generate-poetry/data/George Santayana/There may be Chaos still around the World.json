    "There may be chaos still around the world,",
    "This little world that in my thinking lies;",
    "For mine own bosom is the paradise",
    "Where all my life\u2019s fair visions are unfurled.",
    "Within my nature\u2019s shell I slumber curled,",
    "Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",
    "Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",
    "Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.",
    "I heed them not; or if the subtle night",
    "Haunt me with deities I never saw,",
    "I soon mine eyelid\u2019s drowsy curtain draw",
    "To hide their myriad faces from my sight.",
    "They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe",
    "A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw."

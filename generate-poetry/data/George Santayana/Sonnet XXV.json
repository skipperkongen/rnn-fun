    "As in the midst of battle there is room",
    "For thoughts of love, and in foul sin for mirth;",
    "As gossips whisper of a trinket\u2019s worth",
    "Spied by the death-bed\u2019s flickering candle-gloom;",
    "As in the crevices of Caesar\u2019s tomb",
    "The sweet herbs flourish on a little earth:",
    "So in this great disaster of our birth",
    "We can be happy, and forget our doom.",
    "For morning, with a ray of tenderest joy",
    "Gilding the iron heaven, hides the truth,",
    "And evening gently woos us to employ",
    "Our grief in idle catches. Such is youth;",
    "Till from that summer\u2019s trance we wake, to find",
    "Despair before us, vanity behind."

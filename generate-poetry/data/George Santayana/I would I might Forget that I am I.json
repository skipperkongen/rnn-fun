    "I would I might forget that I am I,",
    "And break the heavy chain that binds me fast,",
    "Whose links about myself my deeds have cast.",
    "What in the body\u2019s tomb doth buried lie",
    "Is boundless; \u2019tis the spirit of the sky,",
    "Lord of the future, guardian of the past,",
    "And soon must forth, to know his own at last.",
    "In his large life to live, I fain would die.",
    "Happy the dumb beast, hungering for food,",
    "But calling not his suffering his own;",
    "Bless\u00e8d the angel, gazing on all good,",
    "But knowing not he sits upon a throne;",
    "Wretched the mortal, pondering his mood,",
    "And doomed to know his aching heart alone."

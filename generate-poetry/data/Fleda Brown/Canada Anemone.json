    "I count nineteen white blossoms",
    "which would not be",
    "visible except for",
    "their wiry stems that catapult them",
    "above the grass like",
    "the last white pop",
    "of fireworks, a toothed blast",
    "of leaf below. It\u2019s",
    "the Fourth of July",
    "on the bank of Hinkson Creek",
    "fifty years ago, the powder-",
    "bitterness, the red",
    "combustion, my life, since",
    "means wind, means",
    "change, no matter",
    "that I\u2019ve been held all along in this",
    "thin twenty miles of atmosphere.",
    "The wind\u2019s disturbed",
    "the leaves, rolled the waves,",
    "convincing enough. Each",
    "star of a bloom",
    "is driven upward almost against",
    "its small nature. All it can do",
    "is hang on and die.",
    "Still, it did want to go",
    "as high as possible,",
    "for some reason,",
    "to sway up there like an art object."

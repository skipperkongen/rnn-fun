    "When Isr\u2019el, freed from Pharaoh\u2019s hand,",
    "Left the proud tyrant and his land,",
    "The tribes with cheerful homage own",
    "Their king; and Judah was his throne.",
    "Across the deep their journey lay;",
    "The deep divides to make them way.",
    "Jordan beheld their march, and led,",
    "With backward current, to his head.",
    "The mountains shook like frighted sheep,",
    "Like lambs the little hillocks leap;",
    "Not Sinai on her base could stand,",
    "Conscious of sov\u2019reign pow\u2019r at hand.",
    "What pow\u2019r could make the deep divide?",
    "Make Jordan backward roll his tide?",
    "Why did ye leap, ye little hills?",
    "And whence the fright that Sinai feels?",
    "Let ev\u2019ry mountain, ev\u2019ry flood,",
    "Retire and know th\u2019 approaching God,",
    "The King of Isr\u2019el: see him here!",
    "Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear.",
    "He thunders, and all nature mourns;",
    "The rock to standing pools he turns,",
    "Flints spring with fountains at his word,",
    "And fires and seas confess the Lord."

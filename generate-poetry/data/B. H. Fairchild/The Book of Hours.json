    "Like the blue angels of the nativity, the museum patrons",
    "hover around the art historian, who has arrived frazzled",
    "and limp after waking late in her boyfriend\u2019s apartment.",
    ", she notes,",
    "where atop Hadrian\u2019s mausoleum the angel of death",
    "returns his bloody sword to its scabbard, and staring",
    "down at the marble floor, liquid in the slanted",
    "silver light of mid-morning, she ponders briefly",
    "the polished faces of her audience: seraphim gazing",
    "heavenward at the golden throne, or, as she raises",
    "her tired eyes to meet their eyes, the evolving souls",
    "of purgatory, bored as the inhabitants of some",
    "fashionable European spa sunbathing on boulders.",
    "on Patmos, robed in blue and gold, and she tells the story",
    "of gall-nuts, goats\u2019 skins dried and stretched into vellum\u2014",
    "the word",
    "delicious in its saying, caressed",
    "in her mouth like a fat breakfast plum\u2014lapis lazuli",
    "crushed into pools of ultramarine blue, and gold foil",
    "hammered thin enough to float upon the least breath,",
    "the scribes hastily scraping gold flakes into ceramic cups,",
    "curling their toes against the cold like her lover stepping",
    "out of bed in that odd, delicate way of his, wisps of gold",
    "drifting like miniature angels onto the scriptorium\u2019s",
    "stone floor, and dogs\u2019 teeth to polish the gold leaf",
    ", she says,",
    "mind conceived the soul to be.",
    "The patrons are beginning",
    "to wander now as she points to the crucifixion scene,",
    "of Adam lying scattered beneath the Roman soldier\u2019s horse,",
    "and the old custodian wipes palm prints from the glass, the monks",
    "breathe upon their fingertips and pray against the hard winter,",
    "and the art historian recalls the narrow shafts of light tapping",
    "the breakfast table, the long curve of his back in half-shadow,",
    "the bed\u2019s rumpled sheets lifted by an ocean breeze",
    "as if they were the weightless gold leaf of the spirit."

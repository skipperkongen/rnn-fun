    "As a kid sitting in a yellow vinyl",
    "booth in the back of Earl\u2019s Tavern,",
    "you watch the late-afternoon drunks",
    "coming and going, sunlight breaking",
    "through the smoky dark as the door",
    "opens and closes, and it\u2019s the future",
    "flashing ahead like the taillights",
    "of a semi as you drop over a rise",
    "in the road on your way to Amarillo,",
    ",",
    "as Billy used to say, slumped over",
    "his beer like a snail,",
    "out of you, the smile bleak as the gaps",
    "between his teeth,",
    "don\u2019t die before you\u2019re dead. Always",
    "the warnings from men you worked with",
    "before they broke, blue fingernails,",
    "eyes red as fate.",
    "for me, you think, and outside later,",
    "feeling young and strong enough to raise",
    "the sun back up, you stare down Highway 54,",
    "pushing everything\u2014stars, sky, moon,",
    "all but a thin line at the edge",
    "of the world\u2014behind you. Your headlights",
    "sweep across the tavern window,",
    "ripping the dark from the small, humped",
    "shapes of men inside who turn and look,",
    "like small animals caught in the glare",
    "of your lights on the road to Amarillo."

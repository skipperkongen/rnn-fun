    "The heavy bodies lunge, the broken language",
    "of fake and drive, glamorous jump shot",
    "slowed to a stutter. Their gestures, in love",
    "again with the pure geometry of curves,",
    "rise toward the ball, falter, and fall away.",
    "On the boards their hands and fingertips",
    "tremble in tense little prayers of reach",
    "and balance. Then, the grind of bone",
    "and socket, the caught breath, the sigh,",
    "the grunt of the body laboring to give",
    "birth to itself. In their toiling and grand",
    "sweeps, I wonder, do they still make love",
    "to their wives, kissing the undersides",
    "of their wrists, dancing the old soft-shoe",
    "of desire? And on the long walk home",
    "from the VFW, do they still sing",
    "to the drunken moon? Stands full, clock",
    "moving, the one in army fatigues",
    "and houseshoes says to himself,",
    ",",
    "and the phrase sounds musical as ever,",
    "radio crooning songs of love after the game,",
    "the girl leaning back in the Chevy\u2019s front seat",
    "as her raven hair flames in the shuddering",
    "light of the outdoor movie, and now he drives,",
    "gliding toward the net. A glass wand",
    "of autumn light breaks over the backboard.",
    "Boys rise up in old men, wings begin to sprout",
    "at their backs. The ball turns in the darkening air."

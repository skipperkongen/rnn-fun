    "Outside my window the wasps",
    "are making their slow circle,",
    "dizzy flights of forage and return,",
    "hovering among azaleas",
    "that bob in a sluggish breeze",
    "this humid, sun-torn morning.",
    "Yesterday my wife held me here",
    "as I thrashed and moaned, her hand",
    "in my foaming mouth, and my son",
    "saw what he was warned he might.",
    "Last night dreams stormed my brain",
    "in thick swirls of shame and fear.",
    "Behind a white garage a locked shed",
    "full of wide-eyed dolls burned,",
    "yellow smoke boiling up in huge clumps",
    "as I watched, feet nailed to the ground.",
    "In dining cars white table cloths",
    "unfolded wings and flew like gulls.",
    "An old German in a green Homburg",
    "sang lieder,",
    ".",
    "In a garden in Pasadena my father",
    "posed in Navy whites while overhead",
    "silver dirigibles moved like great whales.",
    "And in the narrowing tunnel",
    "of the dream\u2019s end I flew down",
    "onto the iron red road",
    "of my grandfather\u2019s farm.",
    "There was a white rail fence.",
    "In the green meadow beyond,",
    "a small boy walked toward me.",
    "His smile was the moon\u2019s rim.",
    "Across his egg-shell eyes",
    "ran scenes from my future life,",
    "and he embraced me like a son",
    "or father or my lost brother."

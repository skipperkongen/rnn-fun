    "You follow close behind me,",
    "for a thousand miles responsive to my movements.",
    "I signal, you signal back. We will meet at the next exit.",
    "You blow kisses, which I return.",
    "You mouth \"I love you,\" a message for my rearview mirror.",
    "We do a slow tango as we change lanes in tandem,",
    "gracefully, as though music were guiding us.",
    "It is tighter than bodies locked in heat,",
    "this caring, this ardent watching."

    "Alas, so all things now do hold their peace!",

    "The night\u00e8s car the stars about doth bring;",
    "Calm is the sea; the waves work less and less:",
    "So am not I, whom love, alas! doth wring,",
    "Bringing before my face the great increase",
    "Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing,",
    "In joy and woe, as in a doubtful case.",
    "For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring:",
    "But by and by, the cause of my disease",
    "Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting,",
    "When that I think what grief it is again",
    "To live and lack the thing should rid my pain."

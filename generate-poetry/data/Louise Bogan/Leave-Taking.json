    "I do not know where either of us can turn",
    "Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other.",
    "I do not know how we can bear",
    "The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon,",
    "Or many trees shaken together in the darkness.",
    "We shall wish not to be alone",
    "And that love were not dispersed and set free\u2014",
    "Though you defeat me,",
    "And I be heavy upon you.",
    "But like earth heaped over the heart",
    "Is love grown perfect.",
    "Like a shell over the beat of life",
    "Is love perfect to the last.",
    "So let it be the same",
    "Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another;",
    "Let us know this for leavetaking,",
    "That I may not be heavy upon you,",
    "That you may blind me no more."

    "She has attained the permanence",
    "She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.",
    "Untended stalks blow over her",
    "Even and swift, like young men running.",
    "Always in the heart she loved",
    "Others had lived,\u2014she heard their laughter.",
    "She lies where none has lain before,",
    "Where certainly none will follow after."

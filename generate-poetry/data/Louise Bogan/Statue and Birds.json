    "Here, in the withered arbor, like the arrested wind,",
    "Straight sides, carven knees,",
    "Stands the statue, with hands flung out in alarm",
    "Or remonstrances.",
    "Over the lintel sway the woven bracts of the vine",
    "In a pattern of angles.",
    "The quill of the fountain falters, woods rake on the sky",
    "Their brusque tangles.",
    "The birds walk by slowly, circling the marble girl,",
    "The golden quails,",
    "The pheasants, closed up in their arrowy wings,",
    "Dragging their sharp tails.",
    "The inquietudes of the sap and of the blood are spent.",
    "What is forsaken will rest.",
    "But her heel is lifted,\u2014she would flee,\u2014the whistle of the birds",
    "Fails on her breast."

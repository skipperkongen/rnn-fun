    "This time we are getting drunk on retsina",
    "in somebody\u2019s Italian backyard. We are a long way",
    "from Georgia",
    "and all of us are lonely. I wave my arms",
    "and caw like Hadrian after his lover drowned himself.",
    "My wife walks by the pond singing a hymn;",
    "I think she is leaving me for good. I say, Imagine",
    "my heart is huge and has",
    "little men",
    "walking around inside. They don\u2019t know each other",
    "but they\u2019re stuck there eternally",
    "and have to get along. One of them starts shouting;",
    "he finds a black horse and rides it around in a circle.",
    "The others laugh at him. He leaps from the horse and",
    "starts to choke the smallest man. Something like a hand",
    "starts pumping the heart",
    "and the men nearly go crazy from the pressure.",
    "\u2014The first olive I picked from a tree",
    "was so bitter I nearly threw up. My wife is strolling",
    "around this strange landscape full of broken pediments",
    "as if she plans to be happy from now on. I think",
    "I have to tense it up, act like I\u2019m in control.",
    "I don\u2019t think I can do that. In a few hours the sun will",
    "rise over my brother\u2019s backyard in south Georgia.",
    "He\u2019ll come out and admire the water jewels",
    "the night has hung in the kumquat bush. He\u2019ll hear his son say,",
    "\u2018Mama,",
    "it\u2019s too big for me to wear,\u2019 and remember quitting the baseball team",
    "thirty years ago",
    "and wish again he hadn\u2019t.",
    "\u2014I get up and march down to the pond. I start to speak",
    "to my wife",
    "but then I feel a hand",
    "that is about to crush my heart."

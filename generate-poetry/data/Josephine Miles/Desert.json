    "When with the skin you do acknowledge drought,",
    "The dry in the voice, the lightness of feet, the fine",
    "Flake of the heat at every level line;",
    "When with the hand you learn to touch without",
    "Surprise the spine for the leaf, the prickled petal,",
    "The stone scorched in the shine, and the wood brittle;",
    "Then where the pipe drips and the fronds sprout",
    "And the foot-square forest of clover blooms in sand,",
    "You will lean and watch, but never touch with your hand."

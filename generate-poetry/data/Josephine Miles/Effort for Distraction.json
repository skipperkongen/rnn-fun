    "Effort for distraction grew",
    "Ferocious, grew",
    "Ferocious and paced, that was its exercise.",
    "Effort for distraction strained,",
    "Legged in the hour-like single stretch",
    "Its heels and sight to feel, so slit its eyes.",
    "Effort without effort or with",
    "Greatest possible effort always centered",
    "Back in the concentrated trough where lies",
    "The magnet to the filings,",
    "The saw tooth to the tongue,",
    "The turn of life to a returning life.",
    "By all the traction of mind and spin of spirit",
    "Having gained grasp gasped to bear it,",
    "Having got ground groaned, furious title holder.",
    "Paced and cried, so sore for a different direction, grew",
    "Ferocious, grew",
    "Unkind to strength that gave it strength to grow."

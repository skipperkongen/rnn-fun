    "After her pills the girl slept and counted",
    "Pellet on pellet the regress of life.",
    "Dead to the world, the world's count yet counted",
    "Pellet on pill the antinomies of life.",
    "Refused to turn, the way's back, she counted",
    "Her several stones across the mire of life.",
    "And stones away and sticks away she counted",
    "To keep herself out of the country of life.",
    "Lost tally. How the sheep return to home",
    "Is the story she will retrieve",
    "And the only story believe",
    "Of one and one the sheep returning home",
    "To take the shapes of life,",
    "Coming and being counted."

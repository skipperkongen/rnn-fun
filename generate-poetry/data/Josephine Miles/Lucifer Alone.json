    "One rat across the floor and quick to floor's a breeze,",
    "But two a whisper of a human tongue.",
    "One is a breath, two voice;",
    "And one a dream, but more are dreamed too long.",
    "Two are the portent which we may believe at length,",
    "And two the tribe we recognize as true.",
    "Two are the total,",
    "saying and",
    "saying,",
    "So we must ponder what we are to do.",
    "For every scuttle of motion in the corner of the eye",
    "Some thought of thought is asked in us indeed,",
    "But of two, more: there we have likeness moving,",
    "And there knowledge therefore, and therefore creed."

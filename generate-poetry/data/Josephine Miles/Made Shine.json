    "This face had no use for light, took none of it,",
    "Grew cavernous against stars, bore into noon",
    "A dark of midnight by its own resources.",
    "Yet where it lay in sleep, where the pillows held it",
    "With the blind plaster over it and the four walls",
    "Keeping the night carefully, it was undone.",
    "Sixty-watt light, squared to a window frame,",
    "Across a well of air, across wind and window",
    "Leaped and made shine the dark face in its sleep."

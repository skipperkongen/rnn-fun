    "The contours of the girl blur. She is both becoming and fact.",

    "Having not ever been whole. Or simple. Or young. Just split and open.",
    "Not of it. For it. Born a cog of hard wheel at five, six, seven . . .",
    "What to know of what has never been?",

    "What does the mouth do? It does not mean no, saying no.",
    "It does not mean yes. It gurgles. It swells. It is comfort.",
    "A quick kick. Mighty, mighty."

    "What is the sound of sounds",
    "sounding indefinite fist in face again and",
    "sound of the surprise of it coming",
    "from nowhere, of breaking the arm",
    "on a small fall in your own house,",
    "a respiratory failure, wound opening like a little mouth.",
    "We inhabit the brutal. We are shattered everyday.",
    "We look askew. Head broken floor array, light",
    "array, great distances, life goals.",

    "That the search for the secret leaker is unyielding\u2014",
    "If you want, you can make a myopic focus, concentrate",
    "on a shone shadow or drift off into space."

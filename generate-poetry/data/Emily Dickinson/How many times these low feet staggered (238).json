    "How many times these low feet staggered -",

    "Handle the adamantine fingers",
    "Never a thimble - more - shall wear -",
    "Buzz the dull flies - on the chamber window -",
    "Brave - shines the sun through the freckled pane -",
    "Fearless - the cobweb swings from the ceiling -",
    "Indolent Housewife - in Daisies - lain!"

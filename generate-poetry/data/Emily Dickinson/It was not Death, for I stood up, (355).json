    "It was not Death, for I stood up,",

    "Nor Fire - for just my marble feet",
    "Could keep a Chancel, cool -",
    "And yet, it tasted, like them all,",
    "The Figures I have seen",
    "Set orderly, for Burial",
    "Reminded me, of mine -",
    "As if my life were shaven,",
    "And fitted to a frame,",
    "And could not breathe without a key,",
    "And \u2019twas like Midnight, some -",
    "When everything that ticked - has stopped -",
    "And space stares - all around -",
    "Or Grisly frosts - first Autumn morns,",
    "Repeal the Beating Ground -",
    "But most, like Chaos - Stopless - cool -",
    "Without a Chance, or spar -",
    "Or even a Report of Land -",
    "To justify - Despair."

    "And do I smile, such cordial light",
    "Opon the Valley glow -",
    "It is as a Vesuvian face",

    "On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -",
    "Or an emphatic Thumb -",
    "Though I than He - may longer live",
    "He longer must - than I -",
    "For I have but the power to kill,",
    "Without - the power to die -"

    "\u201cHope\u201d is the thing with feathers -",

    "And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -",

    "That could abash the little Bird",
    "That kept so many warm -",
    "I\u2019ve heard it in the chillest land -",
    "And on the strangest Sea -",
    "Yet - never - in Extremity,",
    "It asked a crumb - of me."

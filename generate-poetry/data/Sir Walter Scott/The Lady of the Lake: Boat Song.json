    "Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances!",
    "Honored and blessed be the ever-green Pine!",
    "Long may the tree, in his banner that glances,",
    "Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line!",
    "Heaven sent it happy dew,",
    "Earth lend it sap anew,",
    "Gayly to bourgeon and broadly to grow,",
    "While every Highland glen",
    "Sends our shout back again,",
    "\u201cRoderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!\u201d",
    "Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain,",
    "Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade;",
    "When the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain,",
    "The more shall Clan-Alpine exult in her shade.",
    "Moored in the rifted rock,",
    "Proof to the tempest\u2019s shock,",
    "Firmer he roots him the ruder it blow;",
    "Menteith and Breadalbane, then,",
    "Echo his praise again,",
    "\u201cRoderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!\u201d",
    "Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen Fruin,",
    "And Bannochar\u2019s groans to our slogan replied;",
    "Glen-Luss and Ross-dhu, they are smoking in ruin,",
    "And the best of Loch Lomond lie dead on her side.",
    "Widow and Saxon maid",
    "Long shall lament our raid,",
    "Think of Clan-Alpine with fear and with woe;",
    "Lennox and Leven-glen",

    "Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands!",
    "Stretch to your oars for the ever-green Pine!",
    "O that the rosebud that graces yon islands",
    "Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!",
    "O that some seedling gem,",
    "Worthy such noble stem",
    "Honored and blessed in their shadow might grow!",
    "Loud should Clan-Alpine then",
    "Ring from her deepmost glen,",

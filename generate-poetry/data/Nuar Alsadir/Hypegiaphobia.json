    "We are descending again in parallel\u2014",
    "I cannot say together\u2014as in another dream",
    "you rushed through the first door",
    "without me. It was late. Your name",
    "was an elevator door resisting its rail,",
    "its screech my only attempt to reach you.",
    "Was it the hurt that filled the elevator",
    "I entered with gurneys and gowned girls,",
    "incubated hearts pumping for a home?",
    "Floors flicker as they fall.",
    "The girls\u2019 chatter flaps shrill at light,",
    "tangles in my hair and away",
    "like spring, like spring\u2014",
    "When the doors open",
    "you will be on the other side, waiting,",
    "mistaking my elation for rage."

    "of syllables, your name, what you say",
    "of your childhood fears while you pretended to sleep.",
    "A neighbor\u2019s light switches on in a window",
    "across the airshaft, absorbs the darkness",
    "like a person eager to speak.",
    "There\u2019s a grainy stillness to all,",
    "as though the sleepers had been painted,",
    "as though they became what the painter",
    "layered over in shifting focus",
    "from the couple to the unspoken,",
    "which slips like a mouse between dreams.",
    "You\u2019d have to take a step back to see them:",
    "up close they are nothing more than a cluster",
    "when the only words you hold are stones",
    "that were thrown against the window"

    "Heartworn happiness, fine line that winds",
    "among the tapestry\u2019s old blacks and blues,",
    "bright hair blazing in the theater,",
    "red hair raving in the bar\u2014as now",
    "the little leaves shoot veils of gold",
    "across the trees\u2019 bones, shroud of spring,",
    "ghost of summer, shadblow snow, blood-",
    "russet spoor spilled prodigal on last year\u2019s leaves . . .",
    "When your yellows, greens, and yellow-greens,",
    "your ochres and your umbers have evolved",
    "nearly to hemlock blackness, cypress blackness,",
    "when the woods are rife with soddenness",
    "(unfolded ferns, skunk cabbage by the stream,",
    "barberry by the trunks, and bitter",
    "watercress inside the druid pool)",
    "will your thin, still-glinting thread insist",
    "to catch the eye in filigreed titrations",
    "stitched along among beneath the branches,",
    "in the branches where it lives all winter,",
    "occulted fire, brief constant fleeting gold . . ."

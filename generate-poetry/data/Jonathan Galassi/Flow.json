    "Down the path between the apples",
    "through the maple grove of suicides",
    "then left at the old wall",
    "along the wire fence to the brook-",
    "bank where narcissus noses",
    "into skunk cabbage and hepatica:",
    "Call me Apollo, crashing in the underbrush",
    "with my arrows, my bow saw and clippers",
    "out for your flash of white tail and alert",
    "to hack me a path to your lair, to your cult\u2019s den,",
    "crisscrossing the water with Phoebe again and again",
    "as it elbows below us and runs",
    "for the creek racks",
    "strongest in springtime when everything\u2019s liquid,",
    "tightroping over the rocks",
    "in the plashing braid, hot on your sharp",
    "scent and battling the mayflies",
    "the black flies horseflies mosquitoes",
    "there under the raspberry brambles and getting no nearer . . .",
    "Or am I fleeing your coiling uncoiling",
    "tentacular embrace",
    "battered and scarred, am I seeing",
    "your fabled face in the oily pools,",
    "are these fern hairs sprouting at your knuckles",
    "branchbones, little leaves halving",
    "our limbs with leaves\u2014are they yours or mine?",
    "Your bloodhounds bay at the copper",
    "creek, your velvet cape\u2019s aloft",
    "in the chiaroscuro breeze, you\u2019re near, nearer,",
    "hieing, heying, I\u2019m falling, failing,",
    "gashed, gutted, kneed-up,",
    "muddy and galled\u2014call me",
    "Actaeon...."

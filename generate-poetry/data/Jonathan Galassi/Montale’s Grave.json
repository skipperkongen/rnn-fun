    "Now that the ticket to eternity",
    "has your name on it, we are here to pay",
    "the awkward tribute post-modernity",
    "allows to those who think they think your way",
    "but hear you only faintly, filtered through",
    "a gauze of echoes, sounding in a voice",
    "that could be counterfeit; and yet the noise",
    "seems to expand our notion of the true.",
    "An ivory forehead, landscape drunk on light,",
    "mother-of-pearl that flashes in the night:",
    "intimations of the miracle",
    "when the null steps forward as the all\u2014",
    "these were signals, sparks that spattered from",
    "the anvil of illusions where you learned",
    "the music of a generation burned",
    "by an old myth: the end that will not come.",
    "There is no other myth. This sun-drenched yard",
    "proves it, freighted with the waiting dead,",
    "where votive plastic hyacinths relay",
    "the promise of one more technicolor day",
    "\u2014the promise that is vouchsafed to you, scribe,",
    "and your dictator, while your names get blurred",
    "with all the others, like your hardest word",
    "dissolving in the language of the tribe."

    "The barroom mirror lit up with our wives",
    "has faded to a loaded-to-the-gills",
    "Japanese subcompact, little lives",
    "asleep behind us, heading for the hills",
    "in utter darkness through invisible",
    "countryside we know by heart by light;",
    "but woods that are humane and hospitable",
    "often turn eerie on a moonless night.",
    "Our talk is quiet: the week\u2019s triumphs, failings,",
    "gossip, memories\u2014but largely fears.",
    "In our brief repertoire of poses ailing\u2019s",
    "primary, and more so with the years",
    "now every step seems haunted by the future,",
    "not only ours, but all that they will face:",
    "a stricter world, with scarceness for a teacher,",
    "bad air, bad water, no untrammeled space",
    "or so it seems to us, after the Fall,",
    "but for the young the world is always new.",
    "Maybe that\u2019s what dates us worst of all",
    "and saves them: What we\u2019ll miss they never knew.",
    "We\u2019re old enough now to be old enough,",
    "to know what loss is\u2014not just hair and breath;",
    "each has eyeballed reality by now:",
    "a rift, a failure, or a major death.",
    "They landed on us; we were not consulted,",
    "although our darkest yearnings aren\u2019t so deep.",
    "Let\u2019s tick off the short wish list of adulthood:",
    "sleep, honor, sleep, love, riches, sleep, and sleep . . .",
    "and camaraderie, that warms the blood,",
    "the mildest, most forgiving form of love.",
    "In an uncertain world a certain good",
    "is one who\u2019ll laugh off what you\u2019re leery of.",
    "That\u2019s why we\u2019re out here, racing with the clock",
    "through cold and darkness: so that, glass in hand,",
    "we\u2019ll face our half-life, padded for the shock",
    "by a few old souls who understand.",
    "Now the odometer, uncompromising,",
    "shows all its nines\u2019 tails hanging in the air.",
    "Now an entire row of moons is rising,",
    "rising, rising, risen\u2014we are there:",
    "Total Maturity. The trick is how",
    "to amortize remorse, desire, and dread.",
    "Eyes ahead, companions: Life is Now.",
    "The serious years are opening ahead."

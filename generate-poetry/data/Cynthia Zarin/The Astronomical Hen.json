    "Like hearts marked out but not yet colored in,",
    "Each of her feathers has a black edge,",
    "as if an India-ink mantilla stretched",
    "from uncleaved neck to her fantail. The pen,",
    "homemade, spilled some darkness now and then.",
    "She doesn\u2019t lack for suitors. Poor rooster,",
    "who pours his own loud heart out to her,",
    "surely his begging does no more than force",
    "her to peck out a crooked tattoo in the dirt",
    "of the pen. Is she stumped, sad, anorexic?",
    "It\u2019s perfectly clear she doesn\u2019t lay eggs.",
    "Can it be she\u2019s simply in love with herself?",
    "Her eye obsidian, eye of the world,",
    "at night she watches the stars drop from shelf",
    "to shelf, to minor \u00e9tudes she unfurls",
    "in her head. By day she hunts and re-pecks",
    "the pinprick holes of her intricate sketch.",
    "If she\u2019s done by dusk the first stars can rise."

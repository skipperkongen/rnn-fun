    "Rebuked, she turned and ran",
    "uphill to the barn. Anger, the inner",
    "arsonist, held a match to her brain.",
    "She observed her life: against her will",
    "it survived the unwavering flame.",
    "The barn was empty of animals.",
    "Only a swallow tilted",
    "near the beams, and bats",
    "hung from the rafters",
    "the roof sagged between.",
    "Her breath became steady",
    "where, years past, the farmer cooled",
    "the big tin amphor\u00e6 of milk.",
    "The stone trough was still",
    "filled with water: she watched it",
    "and received its calm.",
    "So it is when we retreat in anger:",
    "we think we burn alone",
    "and there is no balm.",
    "Then water enters, though it makes",
    "no sound."

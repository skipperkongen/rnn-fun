    "The dog and I push through the ring",
    "of dripping junipers",
    "to enter the open space high on the hill",
    "where I let him off the leash.",
    "He vaults, snuffling, between tufts of moss;",
    "twigs snap beneath his weight; he rolls",
    "and rubs his jowls on the aromatic earth;",
    "his pink tongue lolls.",
    "I look for sticks of proper heft",
    "to throw for him, while he sits, prim",
    "and earnest in his love, if it is love.",
    "All night a soaking rain, and now the hill",
    "exhales relief, and the fragrance",
    "of warm earth. . . . The sedges",
    "have grown an inch since yesterday,",
    "and ferns unfurled, and even if they try",
    "the lilacs by the barn can\u2019t",
    "keep from opening today.",
    "I longed for spring\u2019s thousand tender greens,",
    "and the white-throated sparrow\u2019s call",
    "that borders on rudeness. Do you know\u2014",
    "since you went away",
    "all I can do",
    "is wait for you to come back to me."

    "I am the blossom pressed in a book,",
    "found again after two hundred years. . . .",
    "I am the maker, the lover, and the keeper....",
    "When the young girl who starves",
    "sits down to a table",
    "she will sit beside me. . . .",
    "I am food on the prisoner's plate. . . .",
    "I am water rushing to the wellhead,",
    "filling the pitcher until it spills. . . .",
    "I am the patient gardener",
    "of the dry and weedy garden. . . .",
    "I am the stone step,",
    "the latch, and the working hinge. . . .",
    "I am the heart contracted by joy. . . .",
    "the longest hair, white",
    "before the rest. . . .",
    "I am there in the basket of fruit",
    "presented to the widow. . . .",
    "I am the musk rose opening",
    "unattended, the fern on the boggy summit. . . .",
    "I am the one whose love",
    "overcomes you, already with you",
    "when you think to call my name. . . ."

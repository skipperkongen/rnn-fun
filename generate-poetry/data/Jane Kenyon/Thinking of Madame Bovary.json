    "The first hot April day the granite step",
    "was warm. Flies droned in the grass.",
    "When a car went past they rose",
    "in unison, then dropped back down. . . .",
    "I saw that a yellow crocus bud had pierced",
    "a dead oak leaf, then opened wide. How strong",
    "its appetite for the luxury of the sun!",
    "Everyone longs for love\u2019s tense joy and red delights.",
    "And then I spied an ant",
    "dragging a ragged, disembodied wing",
    "up the warm brick walk. It must have been",
    "the Methodist in me that leaned forward,",
    "preceded by my shadow, to put a twig just where",
    "the ant was struggling with its own desire."

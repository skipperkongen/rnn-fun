    "The grasses in the field have toppled,",
    "and in places it seems that a large, now",
    "absent, animal must have passed the night.",
    "The hay will right itself if the day",
    "turns dry. I miss you steadily, painfully.",
    "None of your blustering entrances",
    "or exits, doors swinging wildly",
    "on their hinges, or your huge unconscious",
    "sighs when you read something sad,",
    "like Henry Adams\u2019s letters from Japan,",
    "where he traveled after Clover died.",
    "Everything blooming bows down in the rain:",
    "white irises, red peonies; and the poppies",
    "with their black and secret centers",
    "lie shattered on the lawn."

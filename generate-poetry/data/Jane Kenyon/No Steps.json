    "The young bull dropped his head and stared.",
    "Only a wispy wire\u2014electrified\u2014kept us",
    "apart. That, and two long rows of asparagus.",
    "An ancient apple tree",
    "blossomed prodigally pink and white.",
    "The muddy path sucked at my shoe,",
    "but I reached the granite step, and knocked",
    "at the rickety porch door.",
    "Deep in the house a dog began to bark.",
    "I had prepared my Heart Fund speech,",
    "and the first word\u2014",
    "\u2014was on my tongue.",
    "I heard no steps\u2014only the breeze",
    "riffling the tender poplar leaves,",
    "and a random, meditative",
    "behind me. . . . Relieved, I turned back",
    "to the car, passing once more",
    "under the bull\u2019s judicial eye. . . .",
    "Everything was intact: the canister,",
    "still far too light and mute,",
    "and metal boutonni\u00e8res where they began\u2014",
    "in a zip-lock plastic sandwich bag."

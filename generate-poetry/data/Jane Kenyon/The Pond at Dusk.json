    "the outward-radiating evidence of food.",
    "The green haze on the trees changes",
    "into leaves, and what looks like smoke",
    "floating over the neighbor\u2019s barn",
    "is only apple blossoms.",
    "But sometimes what looks like disaster",
    "disaster: the day comes at last,",
    "and the men struggle with the casket",
    "just clearing the pews."

    "On the way to the village store",
    "I drive through a down-draft",
    "from the neighbor\u2019s chimney.",
    "Woodsmoke tumbles from the eaves",
    "backlit by sun, reminding me",
    "of the fire and sulfur of Grandmother\u2019s",
    "vengeful God, the one who disapproves",
    "of jeans and shorts for girls,",
    "dancing, strong waters, and adultery.",
    "A moment later the smoke enters",
    "the car, although the windows are tight,",
    "insinuating that I might, like Judas,",
    "and the foolish virgins, and the rich",
    "young man, have been made for unquenchable",
    "fire. God will need something to burn",
    "if the fire is to be unquenchable.",
    "\u201cAll things work together for the good",
    "for those who love God,\u201d she said",
    "to comfort me at Uncle Hazen\u2019s funeral,",
    "where Father held me up to see",
    "the maroon gladiolus that trembled",
    "as we approached the bier, the elaborate",
    "shirred satin, brass fittings, anything,",
    "oh, anything but Uncle\u2019s squelched",
    "and made-up face.",
    "\u201cNo! NO! How is it good to be dead?\u201d",
    "I cried afterward, wild-eyed and flushed.",
    "\u201cGod\u2019s ways are not our ways,\u201d",
    "she said then out of pity",
    "and the wish to forestall the argument."

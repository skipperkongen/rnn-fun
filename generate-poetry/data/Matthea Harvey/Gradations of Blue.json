    "The scent of pig is faint tonight",
    "as the lime trees hang their heads against gradations of blue,",
    "looking at the lone suitcase in the middle of the farmyard",
    "with a sense of solidarity. Also forgotten.",
    "Its owner never once looked up at them and exclaimed",
    "In the plane, her gaze rests on a flock of cloud-birds,",
    "pinkish purple with elongated necks, rests",
    "on the plane\u2019s wing-tip colored pink by the sun.",
    "Her head is heavy with this childhood cargo,",
    "like the hawk that usually flies between or above their branches,",
    "found skimming the ground with its catch of mouse or mole,",
    "or the barge that passes every day at four, its metal nose",
    "just out of the water, while empty at eight, its sleek sides",
    "flash signals to those on shore. Later, on the highway",
    "a row of trucks lit like orange squares in the setting sun\u2014",
    "a colony of ants each with a piece of chrysanthemum",
    "on their backs\u2014begins to reassemble memories;",
    "the petals become lining, the shape of the flower is lost,",
    "so that years later, looking at an old photograph,",
    "she will not remember the names of cousins and uncles",
    "but the exact bend in the river behind them, the pattern of trees."

    "Life! I know not what thou art,",
    "But know that thou and I must part;",
    "And when, or how, or where we met,",
    "I own to me\u2019s a secret yet.",
    "But this I know, when thou art fled,",
    "Where\u2019er they lay these limbs, this head,",
    "No clod so valueless shall be,",
    "As all that then remains of me.",
    "O whither, whither dost thou fly,",
    "Where bend unseen thy trackless course,",
    "And in this strange divorce,",
    "Ah tell where I must seek this compound I?",
    "To the vast ocean of empyreal flame,",
    "From whence thy essence came,",
    "Dost thou thy flight pursue, when freed",
    "From matter\u2019s base encumbering weed?",
    "Or dost thou, hid from sight,",
    "Wait, like some spell-bound knight,",
    "Through blank oblivious years th\u2019 appointed hour,",
    "To break thy trance and reassume thy power?",
    "Yet canst thou without thought or feeling be?",
    "O say what art thou, when no more thou \u2019rt thee?",
    "Life! we\u2019ve been long together,",
    "Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;",
    "\u2019Tis hard to part when friends are dear;",
    "Perhaps \u2019t will cost a sigh, a tear;",
    "Then steal away, give little warning,",
    "Choose thine own time;",
    "Say not Good night, but in some brighter clime",
    "Bid me Good morning."

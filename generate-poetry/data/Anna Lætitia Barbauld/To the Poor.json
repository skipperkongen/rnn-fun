    "Child of distress, who meet\u2019st the bitter scorn",
    "Of fellow-men to happier prospects born,",
    "Doomed Art and Nature\u2019s various stores to see",
    "Flow in full cups of joy\u2014and not for thee;",
    "Who seest the rich, to heaven and fate resigned,",
    "Bear",
    "afflictions with a patient mind;",
    "Whose bursting heart disdains unjust control,",
    "Who feel\u2019st oppression\u2019s iron in thy soul,",
    "Who dragg\u2019st the load of faint and feeble years,",
    "Whose bread is anguish, and whose water tears;",
    "Bear, bear thy wrongs\u2014fulfill thy destined hour,",
    "Bend thy meek neck beneath the foot of Power;",
    "But when thou feel\u2019st the great deliverer nigh,",
    "And thy freed spirit mounting seeks the sky,",
    "Let no vain fears thy parting hour molest,",
    "No whispered terrors shake thy quiet breast:",
    "Think not their threats can work thy future woe,",
    "Nor deem the Lord above like lords below;\u2014",
    "Safe in the bosom of that love repose",
    "By whom the sun gives light, the ocean flows;",
    "Prepare to meet a Father undismayed,",
    "Nor fear the God whom priests and kings have made."

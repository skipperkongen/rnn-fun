    "Black maid, complain not that I fly,",
    "When Fate commands antipathy:",
    "Prodigious might that union prove,",
    "Where Night and Day together move,",
    "And the conjunction of our lips",
    "Not kisses make, but an eclipse,",
    "In which the mixed black and white",
    "Portends more terror than delight.",
    "Yet if my shadow thou wilt be,",
    "Enjoy thy dearest wish. But see",
    "Thou take my shadow\u2019s property,",
    "That hastes away when I come nigh.",
    "Else stay till death hath blinded me,",
    "And then I will bequeath myself to thee."

    "But whose did? She\u2019s crumpled where she\u2019s supposed to be unfolded,",
    "something bad written on a piece of paper. Her walking",
    "is a devolution that hunches and shrinks everyone",
    "as she moves up the tree-lined street. I\u2019m on my porch waving to my neighbors",
    "and having one of those honeyed afternoons when I don\u2019t know who I am.",
    "I know everything else, though, and it\u2019s ringing in my head. Then there she is",
    "in a pool on my front steps, laughing, asking about lunch, as if the bones",
    "of at least four different animals weren\u2019t loose inside her, scurrying this way and that.",
    "Someone needs to find her a place to live, a hidey hole we can cram food in",
    "and get away from quickly. We could call her part bird",
    "and be done with it. But everyone is dying right under the surface these days,",
    "especially around the eyes. Death has crawled up into the face",
    "to nibble away whatever blocks its view of the stars.",
    "We\u2019re riddled with it. It\u2019s pulling our flesh",
    "into outrageous, unwilled positions, like the huge smile on my face",
    "as I lift her onto my lap and hold her together for a minute",
    "before I tell her she isn\u2019t welcome here."

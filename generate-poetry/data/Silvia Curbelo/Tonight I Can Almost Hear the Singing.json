    "There is a music to this sadness.",
    "In a room somewhere two people dance.",
    "I do not mean to say desire is everything.",
    "A cup half empty is simply half a cup.",
    "How many times have we been there and not there?",
    "I have seen waitresses slip a night's",
    "worth of tips into the jukebox, their eyes",
    "saying",
    "to nothing in particular.",
    "Desire is not the point.",
    "Tonight your name is a small thing",
    "falling through sadness. We wake alone",
    "in houses of sticks, of straw, of wind.",
    "How long have we stood at the end of the pier",
    "watching that water going?",
    "In the distance the lights curve along",
    "Tampa Bay, a wishbone ready to snap",
    "and the night riding on that half promise,",
    "a half moon to light the whole damned sky.",
    "This is the way things are with us.",
    "Sometimes we love almost enough.",
    "We say",
    "more than this and faith feeds",
    "on its own version of the facts.",
    "In the end the heart turns on itself",
    "like hunger to a spoon.",
    "We make a wish in a vanishing landscape.",
    "Sadness is one more reference point",
    "like music in the distance.",
    "Two people rise from a kitchen table",
    "as if to dance. What do they know",
    "about love?"

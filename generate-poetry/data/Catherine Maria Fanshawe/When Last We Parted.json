    "When last we parted, thou wert young and fair,",
    "How beautiful let fond remembrance say!",
    "Alas! since then old time has stolen away",
    "Full thirty years, leaving my temples bare.\u2014",
    "So has it perished like a thing of air,",
    "The dream of love and youth!\u2014 now both are grey",
    "Yet still remembering that delightful day,",
    "Though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair,",
    "Though I have suffered many years of pain",
    "Since then, though I did never think to live",
    "To hear that voice or see those eyes again,",
    "I can a sad but cordial greeting give,",
    "And for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer\u2014",
    "As when I loved thee young and fair."

    "There are some things we just don\u2019t talk about\u2014",
    "Not even in the morning, when we\u2019re waking,",
    "When your calloused fingers tentatively walk",
    "The slope of my waist:",
    "How love\u2019s a rust-worn boat,",
    "Abandoned at the dock\u2014and who could doubt",
    "Waves lick their teeth, eyeing its hull? We\u2019re taking",
    "Our wreckage as a promise, so we don\u2019t talk.",
    "We wet the tired oars, tide drawing us out.",
    "We understand there\u2019s nothing to be said.",
    "Both of us know the dangers of this sea,",
    "Warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts\u2014.",
    "But we\u2019ve already strayed from the harbor. We thread",
    "A slow wake though the water\u2014then silently,",
    "We start to row, and will for as long as this lasts."

    "Eventually, I grab the back-door key",
    "from the cup-holder, slip a folded list",
    "into my pocket. Inside, I dig through closets",
    "to find the lincoln logs, the cardinal statue,",
    "the clock shaped like an elephant, a kettle\u2014",
    "but the whole time I half expect to hear her:",
    "the careful shuffle of her slow, flat feet;",
    "her walker's unpredictable clap; her voice",
    "trembling with evangelical vibrato.",
    "Beside the bed, I find a King James Bible,",
    "her careful marginalia penciled in:",
    "I set it down.",
    "I shouldn't want it just because it's hers."

    "Columns, arches, vaults: how he knew",
    "The ways you promise what you lack;",
    "And that your bodies, like your souls,",
    "Always slip from our grasping hands.",
    "Space is such a lure . . . Swift to disappoint,",
    "As they raise and topple clouds, the sky's",
    "Architects still offer more than ours,",
    "Who only build a scaffolding of dreams.",
    "He dreamed, all the same; but on that day,",
    "He gave a better use to beauty's shapes:",
    "He understood that form means to die.",
    "And this, his final work, is a coin",
    "With both sides bare. He made in stone,",
    "Of this great room, the arrow and the bow."

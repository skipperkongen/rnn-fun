    "Grown about by fragrant bushes,",
    "Sunken in a winding valley,",
    "Where the clear winds blow",
    "And the shadows come and go,",
    "And the cattle stand and low",
    "And the sheep bells and the linnets",
    "Sing and tinkle musically.",
    "Between the past and the future,",
    "Those two black infinities",
    "Between which our brief life",
    "Flashes a moment and goes out."

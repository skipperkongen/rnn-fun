    "The princess in her world-old tower pined",
    "A prisoner, brazen-caged, without a gleam",
    "Of sunlight, or a windowful of wind;",
    "She lived but in a long lamp-lighted dream.",
    "They brought her forth at last when she was old;",
    "The sunlight on her blanched hair was shed",
    "Too late to turn its silver into gold.",
    "\u201cAh, shield me from this brazen glare!\u201d she said."

    "There is no age, this darkness and decay",
    "Is by a radiant spirit cast aside,",
    "Young with the ageless youth that yesterday",
    "Bent to the yoke of flesh immortal pride.",
    "What though in time of thunder and black cloud",
    "The Spirit of the Innermost recedes",
    "Into the depths of Being, stormy browed,",
    "Obscured by a long life of dreams and deeds\u0097",
    "There is no age\u0097the swiftly passing hour",
    "That measures out our days of pilgrimage",
    "And breaks the heart of every summer flower,",
    "Shall find again the child\u2019s soul in the sage.",
    "There is no age, for youth is the divine;",
    "And the white radiance of the timeless soul",
    "Burns like a silver lamp in that dark shrine",
    "That is the tired pilgrim\u2019s ultimate goal."

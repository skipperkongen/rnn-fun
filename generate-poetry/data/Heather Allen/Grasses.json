    "So still at heart,",
    "They respond like water",
    "To the slightest breeze,",
    "Rippling as one body,",
    "And, as one mind,",
    "Bend continually",
    "To listen:",
    "The perfect confidants,",
    "They keep to themselves,",
    "A web of trails and nests,",
    "Burrows and hidden entrances\u2014",
    "Do not reveal",
    "Those camouflaged in stillness",
    "From the circling hawks,",
    "Or crouched and breathless",
    "At the passing of the fox."

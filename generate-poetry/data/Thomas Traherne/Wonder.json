    "How like an angel came I down!",
    "How bright are all things here!",
    "When first among his works I did appear",
    "O how their glory me did crown!",
    "The world resembled his eternity,",
    "In which my soul did walk;",
    "And ev\u2019ry thing that I did see",
    "Did with me talk.",
    "The skies in their magnificence,",
    "The lively, lovely air;",
    "Oh how divine, how soft, how sweet, how fair!",
    "The stars did entertain my sense,",
    "And all the works of God, so bright and pure,",
    "So rich and great did seem,",
    "As if they ever must endure",
    "In my esteem.",
    "A native health and innocence",
    "Within my bones did grow,",
    "And while my God did all his glories show,",
    "I felt a vigour in my sense",
    "That was all spirit. I within did flow",
    "With seas of life, like wine;",
    "I nothing in the world did know",
    "But \u2019twas divine.",
    "Harsh ragged objects were conceal\u2019d,",
    "Oppressions tears and cries,",
    "Sins, griefs, complaints, dissensions, weeping eyes",
    "Were hid, and only things reveal\u2019d",
    "Which heav\u2019nly spirits, and the angels prize.",
    "The state of innocence",
    "And bliss, not trades and poverties,",
    "Did fill my sense.",
    "The streets were pav\u2019d with golden stones,",
    "The boys and girls were mine,",
    "Oh how did all their lovely faces shine!",
    "The sons of men were holy ones,",
    "In joy and beauty they appear\u2019d to me,",
    "And every thing which here I found,",
    "While like an angel I did see,",
    "Adorn\u2019d the ground.",
    "Rich diamond and pearl and gold",
    "In ev\u2019ry place was seen;",
    "Rare splendours, yellow, blue, red, white and green,",
    "Mine eyes did everywhere behold.",
    "Great wonders cloth\u2019d with glory did appear,",
    "Amazement was my bliss,",
    "That and my wealth was ev\u2019ry where:",
    "No joy to this!",
    "Curs\u2019d and devis\u2019d proprieties,",
    "With envy, avarice",
    "And fraud, those fiends that spoil even Paradise,",
    "Flew from the splendour of mine eyes,",
    "And so did hedges, ditches, limits, bounds,",
    "I dream\u2019d not aught of those,",
    "But wander\u2019d over all men\u2019s grounds,",
    "And found repose.",
    "Proprieties themselves were mine,",
    "And hedges ornaments;",
    "Walls, boxes, coffers, and their rich contents",
    "Did not divide my joys, but all combine.",
    "Clothes, ribbons, jewels, laces, I esteem\u2019d",
    "My joys by others worn:",
    "For me they all to wear them seem\u2019d",
    "When I was born."

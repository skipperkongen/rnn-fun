    "To the same purpose: he, not long before",
    "Brought home from nurse, going to the door",
    "To do some little thing",
    "He must not do within,",
    "With wonder cries,",
    "As in the skies",
    "He saw the moon, \u201cO yonder is the moon,",
    "Newly come after me to town,",
    "That shined at Lugwardin but yesternight,",
    "Where I enjoyed the self-same sight.\u201d",
    "As if it had ev\u2019n twenty thousand faces,",
    "It shines at once in many places;",
    "To all the earth so wide",
    "God doth the stars divide,",
    "With so much art",
    "The moon impart,",
    "They serve us all; serve wholly every one",
    "As if they serv\u00e8d him alone.",
    "While every single person hath such store,",
    "\u2019Tis want of sense that makes us poor."

    "Under dust plush as a moth\u2019s wing,",
    "the book\u2019s leather cover still darkly shown,",
    "and everywhere else but this spot was sodden",
    "beneath the roof\u2019s unraveling shingles.",
    "There was that back-of-the-neck lick of chill",
    "and then, from my index finger, the book",
    "opened like a blasted bird. In its box",
    "of familiar and miraculous inks,",
    "a construction of filaments and dust,",
    "thoroughfares of worms, and a silage",
    "of silverfish husks: in the autumn light,",
    "eight hundred pages of perfect wordless lace."

    "Of the two spoiled, barn-sour geldings",
    "we owned that year, it was Red\u2014",
    "skittish and prone to explode",
    "even at fourteen years\u2014who\u2019d let me",
    "hold to my face his own: the massive labyrinthine",
    "caverns of the nostrils, the broad plain",
    "up the head to the eyes. He\u2019d let me stroke",
    "his coarse chin whiskers and take",
    "his soft meaty underlip",
    "in my hands, press my man\u2019s carnivorous",
    "kiss to his grass-nipping upper half of one, just",
    "so that I could smell",
    "the long way his breath had come from the rain",
    "and the sun, the lungs and the heart,",
    "from a world that meant no harm."

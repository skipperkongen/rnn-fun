    "The wintry west extends his blast,",
    "And hail and rain does blaw;",
    "Or, the stormy north sends driving forth",
    "The blinding sleet and snaw:",
    "While tumbling brown, the burn comes down,",
    "And roars frae bank to brae;",
    "And bird and beast in covert rest,",
    "And pass the heartless day.",
    "The sweeping blast, the sky o\u2019ercast,",
    "The joyless winter-day,",
    "Let others fear, to me more dear",
    "Than all the pride of May:",
    "The tempest\u2019s howl, it soothes my soul,",
    "My griefs it seems to join;",
    "The leafless trees my fancy please,",
    "Their fate resembles mine!",
    "Thou Pow\u2019r Supreme, whose mighty scheme",
    "These woes of mine fulfil,",
    "Here, firm, I rest, they must be best,",
    "Because they are Thy will!",
    "Then all I want (O, do Thou grant",
    "This one request of mine!)",
    "Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,",
    "Assist me to resign."

    "Much better than a goat it was to drop",
    "an anarchist from a Park Row window",
    "because he wouldn\u2019t confess to federal agents.",
    "He fell to his death while sitting on the windowsill",
    "holding a pamphlet close to his eyes and maybe",
    "waving his arm in appreciation, and no one",
    "heard him screaming \u2014 they were wearing earmuffs",
    "or just they forgot to bring their earpieces",
    "but it was nothing, he was a fiend and a cutthroat",
    "and he would have murdered Rockefeller if he had the chance,",
    "for which reason I have locked my front door",
    "for I can\u2019t find a rat trap big enough."

    "In beauty-bright and such it was like Blake\u2019s",
    "lily and though an angel he looked absurd",
    "dragging a lily out of a beauty-bright store",
    "wrapped in tissue with a petal drooping,",
    "nor was it useless\u2014you who know it know",
    "how useful it is\u2014and how he would be dead",
    "in a minute if he were to lose it though",
    "how do you lose a lily?",
    "lily was white",
    "and he had a foolish smile there holding it up like",
    "a candelabrum in his right hand facing the",
    "mirror in the hall nor had the endless",
    "centuries started yet nor was there one thorn",
    "between his small house and the beauty-bright store."

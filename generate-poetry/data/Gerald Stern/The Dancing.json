    "In all these rotten shops, in all this broken furniture",
    "and wrinkled ties and baseball trophies and coffee pots",
    "I have never seen a postwar Philco",
    "with the automatic eye",
    "nor heard Ravel's \"Bolero\" the way I did",
    "in 1945 in that tiny living room",
    "on Beechwood Boulevard, nor danced as I did",
    "then, my knives all flashing, my hair all streaming,",
    "my mother red with laughter, my father cupping",
    "his left hand under his armpit, doing the dance",
    "of old Ukraine, the sound of his skin half drum,",
    "half fart, the world at last a meadow,",
    "the three of us whirling and singing, the three of us",
    "screaming and falling, as if we were dying,",
    "as if we could never stop\u2014in 1945 \u2014",
    "in Pittsburgh, beautiful filthy Pittsburgh, home",
    "of the evil Mellons, 5,000 miles away",
    "from the other dancing\u2014in Poland and Germany\u2014",
    "oh God of mercy, oh wild God."

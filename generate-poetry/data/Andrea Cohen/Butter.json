    "of milk and honey, but at",
    "the Iowa State Fair I glimpsed",
    "a cow fashioned of butter.",
    "It lived behind a window",
    "in an icy room, beneath klieg lights.",
    "I filed past as one files",
    "past a casket at a wake.",
    "It was that sad: a butter cow",
    "without a butter calf. Nearby I spied",
    "a butter motorcycle, motorcycle-",
    "sized, a mechanical afterthought",
    "I thought the cow might have liked to ride.",
    "You don\u2019t drive a motorcycle; you ride it.",
    "But not if you\u2019re a butter cow, not",
    "if you\u2019re a butter cow who\u2019s seen, if",
    "not the land of milk and honey, the land",
    "of milk, and dwelled within it.",
    "It had a short life span, the butter cow.",
    "Before it died, I looked",
    "deep into its butter eyes. It saw",
    "my butter soul. I could",
    "have wept, or spread myself,",
    "for nobody, across dry toast."

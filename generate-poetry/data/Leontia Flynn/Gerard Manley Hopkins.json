    "At the mention of Gerard Manley Hopkins, my mild-mannered father",
    "\u2014 tender, abstracted \u2014 would exercise the right",
    "to revert to type. That is to say: devout; that is, proscriptive. He would rather",
    "we did not so bandy the good Jesuit\u2019s name about",
    "in talk of \u201c",
    "this\u201d and \u201c",
    "that\u201d \u2014 just as he would rather",
    "my sister did not, from the library, request \u201csick\u201d",
    ".",
    "Like tars on a stage deck, yo ho, we roll our eyes.",
    "Somebody snaps on the poisonous gas-fired heater",
    "\u2014 and I put off a year or two the hypothesis",
    "I\u2019ll form, with a wave, to provoke him to these wobblers",
    "that all in such matters swing from pole to pole;",
    "as Hopkins was wont (his muse being bi[nsey] po[p]lar[s])",
    "to swing from joy\u2019s heights, alas, to the abyss",
    "and for whom the mind had \u201cmountains; cliffs of fall.\u201d",
    "\u2022",
    "\u201cO the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall",
    "Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap",
    "May who ne\u2019er hung there.... \u201d Who\u2019s not known the hell",
    "that fashions itself from the third night without sleep \u2014",
    "the third or the fourth \u2014 in whose black margins crawl",
    "shrill horrors, and where breathless, poleaxed, pinned",
    "\u2014 as though in the teeth of an outrageous gale \u2014",
    "the mind \u2014 sick \u2014 preys upon the stricken mind.",
    "And \u201cworst, there is none\u201d \u2014 no none \u2014 than this wild grief:",
    "Citalopram-wired. Our sweating selves self-cursed.",
    "Oh, \u201cMary, mother of us, where is your relief?\u201d",
    "as Hopkins wrote \u2014 but, far gone, at its worst",
    "it\u2019s her first",
    "I want. Please stroke my hair."

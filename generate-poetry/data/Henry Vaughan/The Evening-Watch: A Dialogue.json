    "Farewell! I go to sleep; but when",
    "The day-star springs, I\u2019ll wake again.",
    "Go, sleep in peace; and when thou liest",
    "Unnumber\u2019d in thy dust, when all this frame",
    "Is but one dram, and what thou now descriest",
    "In sev\u2019ral parts shall want a name,",
    "Then may his peace be with thee, and each dust",
    "Writ in his book, who ne\u2019er betray\u2019d man\u2019s trust!",
    "Amen! but hark, ere we two stray",
    "How many hours dost think \u2019till day?",
    "Ah go; th\u2019art weak, and sleepy. Heav\u2019n",
    "Is a plain watch, and without figures winds",
    "All ages up; who drew this circle, even",
    "He fills it; days and hours are blinds.",
    "Yet this take with thee. The last gasp of time",
    "Is thy first breath, and man\u2019s eternal prime."

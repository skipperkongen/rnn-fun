    "I saw Eternity the other night,",
    "Like a great ring of pure and endless light,",
    "All calm, as it was bright;",
    "And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,",
    "Driv\u2019n by the spheres",
    "Like a vast shadow mov\u2019d; in which the world",
    "And all her train were hurl\u2019d.",
    "The doting lover in his quaintest strain",
    "Did there complain;",
    "Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,",
    "Wit\u2019s sour delights,",
    "With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,",
    "Yet his dear treasure",
    "All scatter\u2019d lay, while he his eyes did pour",
    "Upon a flow\u2019r.",
    "The darksome statesman hung with weights and woe,",
    "Like a thick midnight-fog mov\u2019d there so slow,",
    "He did not stay, nor go;",
    "Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl",
    "Upon his soul,",
    "And clouds of crying witnesses without",
    "Pursued him with one shout.",
    "Yet digg\u2019d the mole, and lest his ways be found,",
    "Work\u2019d under ground,",
    "Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see",
    "That policy;",
    "Churches and altars fed him; perjuries",
    "Were gnats and flies;",
    "It rain\u2019d about him blood and tears, but he",
    "Drank them as free.",
    "The fearful miser on a heap of rust",
    "Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust",
    "His own hands with the dust,",
    "Yet would not place one piece above, but lives",
    "In fear of thieves;",
    "Thousands there were as frantic as himself,",
    "And hugg\u2019d each one his pelf;",
    "The downright epicure plac\u2019d heav\u2019n in sense,",
    "And scorn\u2019d pretence,",
    "While others, slipp\u2019d into a wide excess,",
    "Said little less;",
    "The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,",
    "Who think them brave;",
    "And poor despised Truth sate counting by",
    "Their victory.",
    "Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,",
    "And sing, and weep, soar\u2019d up into the ring;",
    "But most would use no wing.",
    "O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night",
    "Before true light,",
    "To live in grots and caves, and hate the day",
    "Because it shews the way,",
    "The way, which from this dead and dark abode",
    "Leads up to God,",
    "A way where you might tread the sun, and be",
    "More bright than he.",
    "But as I did their madness so discuss",
    "One whisper\u2019d thus,",
    "\u201cThis ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,",
    "But for his bride.\u201d"

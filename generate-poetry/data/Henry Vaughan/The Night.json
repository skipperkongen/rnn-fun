    "Through that pure virgin shrine,",
    "That sacred veil drawn o\u2019er Thy glorious noon,",
    "That men might look and live, as glowworms shine,",
    "And face the moon,",
    "Wise Nicodemus saw such light",
    "As made him know his God by night.",
    "Most blest believer he!",
    "Who in that land of darkness and blind eyes",
    "Thy long-expected healing wings could see,",
    "When Thou didst rise!",
    "And, what can never more be done,",
    "Did at midnight speak with the Sun!",
    "O who will tell me where",
    "He found Thee at that dead and silent hour?",
    "What hallowed solitary ground did bear",
    "So rare a flower,",
    "Within whose sacred leaves did lie",
    "The fulness of the Deity?",
    "No mercy-seat of gold,",
    "No dead and dusty cherub, nor carved stone,",
    "But His own living works did my Lord hold",
    "And lodge alone;",
    "Where trees and herbs did watch and peep",
    "And wonder, while the Jews did sleep.",
    "Dear night! this world\u2019s defeat;",
    "The stop to busy fools; care\u2019s check and curb;",
    "The day of spirits; my soul\u2019s calm retreat",
    "Which none disturb!",
    "Christ\u2019s progress, and His prayer time;",
    "The hours to which high heaven doth chime;",
    "God\u2019s silent, searching flight;",
    "When my Lord\u2019s head is filled with dew, and all",
    "His locks are wet with the clear drops of night;",
    "His still, soft call;",
    "His knocking time; the soul\u2019s dumb watch,",
    "When spirits their fair kindred catch.",
    "Were all my loud, evil days",
    "Calm and unhaunted as is thy dark tent,",
    "Whose peace but by some angel\u2019s wing or voice",
    "Is seldom rent,",
    "Then I in heaven all the long year",
    "Would keep, and never wander here.",
    "But living where the sun",
    "Doth all things wake, and where all mix and tire",
    "Themselves and others, I consent and run",
    "To every mire,",
    "And by this world\u2019s ill-guiding light,",
    "Err more than I can do by night.",
    "There is in God, some say,",
    "A deep but dazzling darkness, as men here",
    "Say it is late and dusky, because they",
    "See not all clear.",
    "O for that night! where I in Him",
    "Might live invisible and dim!"

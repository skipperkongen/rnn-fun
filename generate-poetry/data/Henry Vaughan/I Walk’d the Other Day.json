    "I walk\u2019d the other day, to spend my hour,",
    "Into a field,",
    "Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield",
    "A gallant flow\u2019r;",
    "But winter now had ruffled all the bow\u2019r",
    "And curious store",
    "I knew there heretofore.",
    "Yet I, whose search lov\u2019d not to peep and peer",
    "I\u2019 th\u2019 face of things,",
    "Thought with my self, there might be other springs",
    "Besides this here,",
    "Which, like cold friends, sees us but once a year;",
    "And so the flow\u2019r",
    "Might have some other bow\u2019r.",
    "Then taking up what I could nearest spy,",
    "I digg\u2019d about",
    "That place where I had seen him to grow out;",
    "And by and by",
    "I saw the warm recluse alone to lie,",
    "Where fresh and green",
    "He liv\u2019d of us unseen.",
    "Many a question intricate and rare",
    "Did I there strow;",
    "But all I could extort was, that he now",
    "Did there repair",
    "Such losses as befell him in this air,",
    "And would ere long",
    "Come forth most fair and young.",
    "This past, I threw the clothes quite o\u2019er his head;",
    "And stung with fear",
    "Of my own frailty dropp\u2019d down many a tear",
    "Upon his bed;",
    "Then sighing whisper\u2019d, \u201chappy are the dead!",
    "What peace doth now",
    "Rock him asleep below!\u201d",
    "And yet, how few believe such doctrine springs",
    "From a poor root,",
    "Which all the winter sleeps here under foot,",
    "And hath no wings",
    "To raise it to the truth and light of things;",
    "But is still trod",
    "By ev\u2019ry wand\u2019ring clod.",
    "O Thou! whose spirit did at first inflame",
    "And warm the dead,",
    "And by a sacred incubation fed",
    "With life this frame,",
    "Which once had neither being, form, nor name;",
    "Grant I may so",
    "Thy steps track here below,",
    "That in these masques and shadows I may see",
    "Thy sacred way;",
    "And by those hid ascents climb to that day,",
    "Which breaks from Thee,",
    "Who art in all things, though invisibly!",
    "Shew me thy peace,",
    "Thy mercy, love, and ease,",
    "And from this care, where dreams and sorrows reign,",
    "Lead me above,",
    "Where light, joy, leisure, and true comforts move",
    "Without all pain;",
    "There, hid in thee, shew me his life again,",
    "At whose dumb urn",
    "Thus all the year I mourn."

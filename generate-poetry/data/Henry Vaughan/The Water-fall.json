    "With what deep murmurs through time\u2019s silent stealth",
    "Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat\u2019ry wealth",
    "Here flowing fall,",
    "And chide, and call,",
    "As if his liquid, loose retinue stay\u2019d",
    "Ling\u2019ring, and were of this steep place afraid;",
    "The common pass",
    "Where, clear as glass,",
    "All must descend",
    "Not to an end,",
    "But quicken\u2019d by this deep and rocky grave,",
    "Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.",
    "Dear stream! dear bank, where often I",
    "Have sate and pleas\u2019d my pensive eye,",
    "Why, since each drop of thy quick store",
    "Runs thither whence it flow\u2019d before,",
    "Should poor souls fear a shade or night,",
    "Who came, sure, from a sea of light?",
    "Or since those drops are all sent back",
    "So sure to thee, that none doth lack,",
    "Why should frail flesh doubt any more",
    "That what God takes, he\u2019ll not restore?",
    "O useful element and clear!",
    "My sacred wash and cleanser here,",
    "My first consigner unto those",
    "Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!",
    "What sublime truths and wholesome themes",
    "Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!",
    "Such as dull man can never find",
    "Unless that Spirit lead his mind",
    "Which first upon thy face did move,",
    "And hatch\u2019d all with his quick\u2019ning love.",
    "As this loud brook\u2019s incessant fall",
    "In streaming rings restagnates all,",
    "Which reach by course the bank, and then",
    "Are no more seen, just so pass men.",
    "O my invisible estate,",
    "My glorious liberty, still late!",
    "Thou art the channel my soul seeks,",
    "Not this with cataracts and creeks."

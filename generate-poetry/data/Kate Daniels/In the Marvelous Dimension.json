    "(John)",
    "Until then, I\u2019d never liked",
    "petunias, their heavy stems,",
    "the peculiar spittooning sound",
    "of their name. Now I loved",
    "a petunia for all it was worth",
    "\u2014a purplish blue bloom",
    "waving in a red clay pot outside",
    "an office window. My right eye",
    "could see it through the shattered",
    "windshield. My left eye had gone",
    "blank and the roof of the Camaro",
    "pressed my head flat back on the seat.",
    "I diminished to my right eye,",
    "which could only see, past the wreckage,",
    "that one little flower. I felt myself",
    "growing smaller, like Alice,",
    "a trick so I could travel",
    "out of there, to that ledge",
    "where a petunia waved in the dust rising",
    "from a fallen-down freeway.",
    "(Mary)",
    "I picked the kids up",
    "at 4:45, as usual.",
    "As usual, they were antsy",
    "and fighting. Rose tore a hole",
    "in her new knee socks",
    "kicking Justin in the backseat.",
    "Timmy sucked his thumb in the corner.",
    "Then Justin wailed at another",
    "abuse from Rose and I was just about",
    "to yell,",
    "when the whole thing went. I mean",
    "the whole thing, the whole world,",
    "I thought. The car tilted, the road",
    "buckled up and then something was falling",
    "down on us with a horrible screaming.",
    "I guess I stopped driving and turned",
    "to my children with a face of horror.",
    "I reached past the seatbelt for Timmy,",
    "my baby, and that\u2019s when it hit us.",
    "My hand, pressed by the roof, pinned",
    "his leg to the seat and he screamed.",
    "Blood flowed down. Rose, my sweet",
    "little Rose, was already gone.",
    "I couldn\u2019t find her beneath",
    "the bulged-down roof. Justin and Timmy,",
    "they looked to me. They didn\u2019t understand",
    "I was not in charge. I\u2019d always been",
    "their only God. They looked to me.",
    "They wanted me to lift them up",
    "and wipe them clean, to mend",
    "with tenderness their shattered bodies.",
    "But I was pinned in place. Blood",
    "started seeping from Justin\u2019s",
    "mouth. Timmy never spoke again.",
    "And then I knew everything: how we",
    "were going to die and how it didn\u2019t",
    "really matter in the scheme of things.",
    "My babies\u2019 suffering wouldn\u2019t matter.",
    "It was a board game of gigantic",
    "proportions. Our tokens",
    "had been shaken out on the playing board",
    "at 5:04",
    "on the 17th of October",
    "in the year of our Lord, 1989.",
    "(Jane)",
    "I must have been unconscious.",
    "Even now, I can\u2019t remember",
    "anything about what happened",
    "until that arm",
    "reached in the broken window",
    "of the passenger seat.",
    "It was just an arm, a black",
    "person\u2019s arm, very strong",
    "looking with fine hairs",
    "all over it. The fingers",
    "moved on my face, felt",
    "my mouth, and then I heard",
    "a voice shouting,",
    "alive here, breathing.",
    "I knew then it was me.",
    "I was alive but I must be",
    "in trouble. My body",
    "returned to me slowly.",
    "I was laid out flat on my back.",
    "The roof of the car seemed",
    "to be on top of me.",
    "I couldn\u2019t feel anything",
    "but my face where the arm",
    "had touched me. I couldn\u2019t help",
    "thinking about sardines",
    "in their little oily cans,",
    "how, in college, I ate them",
    "on saltines, to save money.",
    "(John)",
    "Years ago, on a lark,",
    "I learned transcendental",
    "meditation. Now I focused",
    "on the blue petunia and slowed",
    "my breathing as I began to understand,",
    "I thought, what had happened.",
    "The whole fucking thing fell down.",
    "I can\u2019t begin to explain",
    "that terror. I\u2019ve put it",
    "in a little box in my brain",
    "and I\u2019m afraid of the day",
    "it will emerge again. That petunia",
    "saved me. Now I have",
    "a whole garden of them",
    "and when I wake at night",
    "with the shits and the sweats",
    "I go out there and lie down",
    "among them, blooming or not,",
    "cold or hot, and I weep long",
    "and deep into the earth.",
    "(Mary)",
    "My baby was the last",
    "one to go.",
    "shall be first. I hope",
    "it\u2019s true. My children",
    "dead around me, I couldn\u2019t",
    "think of anything to do",

    "chair, useless and heavy.",
    "One finger on each has enough",
    "strength left to press these buttons,",
    "moving me forward, moving me",
    "back. I don\u2019t think",
    "it would matter, anyway, to still have",
    "the use of my body. It\u2019s only hands",
    "I care about, my mouth that still",
    "loves. Even in sleep, I feel",
    "his fingers reading my terrified face,",
    "tracing my lips like a patient lover.",
    "He found my breath. You bastards",
    "can have my body.",

    "when I heard this little voice",
    "singing",
    "I thought it had already",
    "gotten to me, like in \u2019Nam,",
    "when I freaked out",
    "on patrol before anything",
    "had happened. But the voice",
    "was real, coming from a dark blue",
    "Toyota squashed almost flat.",
    "When I shone the flash over it,",
    "I could see the dark pool of blood",
    "beneath. In the dark, I could",
    "smell it. I yelled out,",
    "I\u2019m here to help you, and the song",
    "stopped for a moment. Then a voice,",
    "not little at all, harder than any",

    "What I remember is a carhop on Pico hurrying",
    "Toward a blue Chevy,",
    "A crucifix dangling from its rearview mirror",
    "That jiggled as the driver brushed",
    "A revolver against it, in passing, before tucking it",
    "Behind his back & beginning to joke with her.",
    "What I remember",
    "Is the smooth arc the gun made & the way",
    "Jesus shimmied to the rhythm.",
    "\u2022",
    "Someday I\u2019ll go back to the place depicted",
    "By the painting, boarded over by the layers of paint",
    "And abandoned,",
    "And beneath the pastel yellows I\u2019ll find",
    "The Bayside Motel & the little room",
    "With the thin, rumpled coverlet,",
    "And sit down, drinking nothing but the night air",
    "By the window, & wait for her to finish",
    "Dressing, one earring, then another,",
    "And wait until the objects in the room take back",
    "Their shapes in the dawn,",
    "And wait until",
    "Each rumpled crease in the sheets & pillowcase",
    "Is as clear as a gift again, & wait \u2014",
    "At a certain moment, that room, then all the rooms",
    "Of the empty Bayside,",
    "Will turn completely into light.",
    "\u2022",
    "I place a cup on the sill & listen for the faint",
    "Tock of china on wood, & ...",
    "That moment of light is already this one \u2014",
    "Sweet, fickle, oblivious, & gone:",
    "My hand hurrying across the page to get there",
    "On time, that place",
    "Of undoing \u2014",
    "\u2022",
    "Where the shriek of the carhop\u2019s laugh,",
    "And the complete faith of the martyr, as he spins & shimmies in the light,",
    "And the inextricable candor of doubt by which Diebenkorn,",
    "One afternoon, made his presence known",
    "In the yellow pastels, then wiped his knuckles with a rag \u2014",
    "Are one \u2014 are the salt, the nowhere & the cold \u2014",
    "The entwined limbs of lovers & the cold wave\u2019s sprawl."

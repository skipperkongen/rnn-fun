    "Soon they\u2019ll have the speed freak twisting",
    "On a scaffold, soon the birds",
    "Will come to peck out his eyes, & when",
    "He\u2019s too weak & exhausted to turn",
    "His head away, they\u2019ll do it, too,",
    "They\u2019ll peck his eyes right out.",
    "You\u2019ll want to watch it happen, you\u2019ll want",
    "To witness it. You\u2019ll want to see Paolo",
    "And Francesca almost touch before",
    "They\u2019re swept away again, him in one line",
    "Waiting for rations, her in another one,",
    "Both of them naked, standing there,",
    "Cock & nipples shriveled in the cold.",
    "N\u2019ayez les c\u0153urs contre nous endurcis.",
    "In wind & rain, the lovers almost touch,",
    "And gulls & ravens settle on his shoulders.",
    "You watch because you love to watch.",

    ".",
    "I know. The sockets of my eyes are dry",
    "As little thimbles made of blistered skin,",
    "And that inward savor of the infinite",
    "Is salt again, one wave hidden in another.",
    "We\u2019re broken buttons, we\u2019re blown dust.",
    "There\u2019s not one tear left in all of us.",
    "I know, for I am Fran\u00e7ois Villon, murderer,",
    "Thief: pustules, blisters, triumphing sores,",
    "Your disappearing likeness on the cross!"

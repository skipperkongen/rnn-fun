    "\u2019Tis strange indeed to hear us plead",
    "For selling and for buying",
    "When yesterday we said: \u201cAway",
    "With all good things but dying.\u201d",
    "The world\u2019s ago, and we\u2019re agog",
    "To have our first brief inning;",
    "So let\u2019s away through surge and fog",
    "However slight the winning.",
    "What deeds have sprung from plow and pick!",
    "What bank-rolls from tomatoes!",
    "No dainty crop of rhetoric",
    "Can match one of potatoes.",
    "Ye orators of point and pith,",
    "Who force the world to heed you,",
    "What skeletons you\u2019ll journey with",
    "Ere it is forced to feed you.",
    "A little gold won\u2019t mar our grace,",
    "A little ease our glory.",
    "This world\u2019s a better biding place",
    "When money clinks its story."

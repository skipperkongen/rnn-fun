    "On the fleet streams, the Sun, that late arose,",
    "In amber radiance plays; the tall young grass",
    "No foot hath bruised; clear morning, as I pass,",
    "Breathes the pure gale, that on the blossom blows;",
    "And, as with gold yon green hill\u2019s summit glows,",
    "The lake inlays the vale with molten glass:",
    "Now is the year\u2019s soft youth, yet one, alas!",
    "Cheers not as it was wont; impending woes",
    "Weigh on my heart; the joys, that once were mine,",
    "Spring leads not back; and those that yet remain",
    "Fade while she blooms. Each hour more lovely shine",
    "Her crystal beams, and feed her floral train,",
    "But oh with pale, and warring fires, decline",
    "Those eyes, whose light my filial hopes sustain."

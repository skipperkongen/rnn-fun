    "While summer roses all their glory yield",
    "To crown the votary of love and joy,",
    "Misfortune\u2019s victim hails, with many a sigh,",
    "Thee, scarlet Poppy of the pathless field,",
    "Gaudy, yet wild and lone; no leaf to shield",
    "Thy flaccid vest that, as the gale blows high,",
    "Flaps, and alternate folds around thy head.",
    "So stands in the long grass a love-crazed maid,",
    "Smiling aghast; while stream to every wind",
    "Her garish ribbons, smeared with dust and rain;",
    "But brain-sick visions cheat her totured mind,",
    "And bring false peace. Thus, lulling grief and pain,",
    "Kind dreams oblivious from thy juice proceed,",
    "Thou flimsy, showy, melancholy weed."

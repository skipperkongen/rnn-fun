    "life's a cold exercise in looking back,",

    "covered himself in the stuff as a joke\u2014",
    "then spent a week removing mites.) That's",
    "enough. The fields of rushes lay filled",
    "with water, and I said farewell,",
    "my high ship an old, red Volvo DL,",
    "gone to another coast, another peninsula,",
    "one without sleep or amphibious music.",
    "Tonight, in flight from San Francisco\u2014",
    "because everything is truer at a remove\u2014",
    "I watch the man I love watch",
    "the turn of the Sacramento River, then Sacramento,",
    "lit city of legislation and flat land.",
    "I think of Florida, how flat.",
    "I think of forgetting Florida.",
    "And then the landscape grows black."

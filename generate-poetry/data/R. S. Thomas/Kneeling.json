    "Moments of great calm,",
    "Kneeling before an altar",
    "Of wood in a stone church",
    "In summer, waiting for the God",
    "To speak; the air a staircase",
    "For silence; the sun\u2019s light",
    "Ringing me, as though I acted",
    "A great r\u00f4le. And the audiences",
    "Still; all that close throng",
    "Of spirits waiting, as I,",
    "For the message.",
    "Prompt me, God;",
    "But not yet. When I speak,",
    "Though it be you who speak",
    "Through me, something is lost.",
    "The meaning is in the waiting."

    "There was Dai Puw. He was no good.",
    "They put him in the fields to dock swedes,",
    "And took the knife from him, when he came home",
    "At late evening with a grin",
    "Like the slash of a knife on his face.",
    "There was Llew Puw, and he was no good.",
    "Every evening after the ploughing",
    "With the big tractor he would sit in his chair,",
    "And stare into the tangled fire garden,",
    "Opening his slow lips like a snail.",
    "There was Huw Puw, too. What shall I say?",
    "I have heard him whistling in the hedges",
    "On and on, as though winter",
    "Would never again leave those fields,",
    "And all the trees were deformed.",
    "And lastly there was the girl;",
    "Beauty under some spell of the beast.",
    "Her pale face was the lantern",
    "By which they read in life\u2019s dark book",
    "The shrill sentence: God is love."

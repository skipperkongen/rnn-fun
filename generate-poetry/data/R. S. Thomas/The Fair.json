    "The idiot goes round and around",
    "With his brother in a bumping car",
    "At the fair. The famous idiot",

    "Illuminating nothing. This is mankind",
    "Being taken for a ride by a rich",

    "Bump, smile; bump, smile. And the current",
    "Is generated by the smooth flow",
    "Of the shillings. This is an orchestra",
    "Of steel with the constant percussion",
    "Of laughter. But where he should be laughing",
    "Too, his features are split open, and look!",
    "Out of the cracks come warm, human tears."

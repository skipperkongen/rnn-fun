    "As my mother\u2019s memory dims",
    "she\u2019s losing her sense of smell",
    "and can\u2019t remember the toast",
    "blackening the kitchen with smoke",
    "or sniff how nasty the breath of the dog",
    "that follows her yet from room to room,",
    "unable, himself, to hear his own bark.",
    "It\u2019s thus they get around,",
    "the wheezing old hound stone deaf",
    "baying like a smoke alarm",
    "for his amnesiac mistress whose back",
    "from petting him is bent forever",
    "as they shuffle towards the flaming toaster",
    "and split the cindered crisp that\u2019s left."

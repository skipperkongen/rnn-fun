    "The deer racing across a field",
    "of the same clay and tallow",
    "color they are\u2014if they are:",
    "or are they tricks of the light?\u2014",
    "must feel themselves being poured",
    "and pouring through life. We\u2019re not built",
    "but become: trembling columns",
    "of apprehension that ripple",
    "and pass those ripples to and fro",
    "with the world that shakes around us\u2014",
    "it too is something poured",
    "and ceaselessly pouring itself.",
    "February shakes the fields",
    "and trembles in each yellow willow.",
    "\u2022",
    "The violin\u2019s back is not veneer\u2014",
    "the strummed wood shudders together.",
    "Undivided by caution",
    "each note is its own first thought.",
    "My first thought\u2019s a kind of prayer",
    "that I might resonate entire\u2014",
    "sometimes it\u2019s such a meager portion",
    "shaking a little, as if it ought...",
    "Every day, the same desire",
    "to push myself through the door",
    "that leads to some bright place,",
    "brighter than the concert platform,",
    "where the whole self echoes together\u2014",
    "the outer to the inner pleasure.",
    "\u2022",
    "Everything runs together\u2014",
    "the light smells of spring,",
    "the unreasonable brightness",
    "of this peg, this sheet, this line tethering",
    "linen between sky and mud",
    "as if the garden marked a pause",
    "in that eternal return",
    "whose looping trace is the blood",
    "hissing through the ventricles.",
    "Until you spill the lip",
    "trembling on its bright liquid",
    "all you need\u2019s this play of surface\u2014",
    "all that you need. All you have."

    "So spake the imperial sage, purest of men,",
    "Marcus Aurelius. But the stifling den",
    "Of common life, where, crowded up pell-mell,",
    "Our freedom for a little bread we sell,",
    "And drudge under some foolish master's ken",
    "Who rates us if we peer outside our pen\u0097",
    "Match'd with a palace, is not this a hell?",
    "On his truth sincere,",
    "Who spoke these words, no shadow ever came;",
    "And when my ill-school'd spirit is aflame",
    "Some nobler, ampler stage of life to win,",
    "I'll stop, and say: \"There were no succour here!",
    "The aids to noble life are all within.\""

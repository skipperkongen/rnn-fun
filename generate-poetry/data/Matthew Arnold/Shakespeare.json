    "Others abide our question. Thou art free.",
    "We ask and ask\u0097Thou smilest and art still,",
    "Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,",
    "Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,",
    "Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,",
    "Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,",
    "Spares but the cloudy border of his base",
    "To the foil'd searching of mortality;",
    "And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,",
    "Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,",
    "Didst tread on earth unguess'd at.\u0097Better so!",
    "All pains the immortal spirit must endure,",
    "All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,",
    "Find their sole speech in that victorious brow."

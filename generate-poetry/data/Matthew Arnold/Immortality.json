    "Foil'd by our fellow-men, depress'd, outworn,",
    "We leave the brutal world to take its way,",
    "And,",
    ", we say",
    "And will not, then, the immortal armies scorn",
    "The world's poor, routed leavings? or will they,",
    "Who fail'd under the heat of this life's day,",
    "Support the fervours of the heavenly morn?",
    "No, no! the energy of life may be",
    "Kept on after the grave, but not begun;",
    "And he who flagg'd not in the earthly strife,",
    "From strength to strength advancing\u0097only he,",
    "His soul well-knit, and all his battles won,",
    "Mounts, and that hardly, to eternal life."

    "How I\u2019ve changed may not be apparent.",
    "I limp. Read and write, make tea at the stove",
    "as I practiced in rehab. Sometimes, like fire,",
    "a task overwhelms me. I cry for days, shriek",
    "when the phone rings. Like a page pulled from flame,",
    "I\u2019m singed but intact: I don\u2019t burn down the house.",
    "Later, cleared to drive, I did outpatient rehab. Others",
    "lost legs or clutched withered minds in their hands.",
    "A man who can\u2019t speak recognized me",
    "and held up his finger. I knew he meant",
    ". Sixteen since his.",
    "Guadalupe wishes daily",
    ". Nobody",
    "is that. Sometimes, like love, the neurons just cross fire.",
    "You don\u2019t get everything back."

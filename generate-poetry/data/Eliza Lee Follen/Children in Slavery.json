    "When children play the livelong day,",
    "Like birds and butterflies;",
    "As free and gay, sport life away,",
    "And know not care nor sighs:",
    "Then earth and air seem fresh and fair,",
    "All peace below, above:",
    "Life\u2019s flowers are there, and everywhere",
    "Is innocence and love.",
    "When children pray with fear all day,",
    "A blight must be at hand:",
    "Then joys decay, and birds of prey",
    "Are hovering o\u2019er the land:",
    "When young hearts weep as they go to sleep,",
    "Then all the world seems sad:",
    "The flesh must creep, and woes are deep",
    "When children are not glad."

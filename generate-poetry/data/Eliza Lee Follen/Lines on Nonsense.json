    "Yes, nonsense is a treasure!",
    "I love it from my heart;",
    "The only earthly pleasure",
    "That never will depart.",
    "But, as for stupid reason,",
    "That stalking, ten-foot rule,",
    "She\u2019s always out of season,",
    "A tedious, testy fool.",
    "She\u2019s like a walking steeple,",
    "With a clock for face and eyes,",
    "Still bawling to all people,",
    "Time bids us to be wise.",
    "While nonsense on the spire",
    "A weathercock you\u2019ll find,",
    "Than reason soaring higher,",
    "And changing with the wind.",
    "The clock too oft deceives,",
    "Says what it cannot prove;",
    "While every one believes",
    "The vane that turns above.",
    "Reason oft speaks unbidden,",
    "And chides us to our face;",
    "For which she should be chidden,",
    "And taught to know her place.",
    "While nonsense smiles and chatters,",
    "And says such charming things,",
    "Like youthful hope she flatters;",
    "And like a syren sings.",
    "Her charm\u2019s from fancy borrowed,",
    "For she is fancy\u2019s pet;",
    "Her name is on her forehead,",
    "In rainbow colors set.",
    "Then, nonsense let us cherish,",
    "Far, far from reason\u2019s light;",
    "Lest in her light she perish,",
    "And vanish from our sight."

    "Decades now of looking back at it\u2014",
    "in some old satellite\u2019s rearview mirror, say\u2014",
    "has something to show beyond the folds and feeders,",
    "the volumes of magma risen into native rock",
    "or the buried flow of old fires cooling",
    "in ocean beds. The damage has been memorized.",
    "Tool marks left by loose doubts dragged",
    "across a certainty. Tongues of river",
    "sediment slumped but still flickering",
    "in the eye. And how pale the surfaces are!",
    "From miles above what even to others is familiar,",
    "the erosion\u2014tears that freeze and crack",
    "the heart, small habits a wind blasts",
    "against whatever\u2019s exposed\u2014seems apparent:",
    "all\u2019s worn down, weathered, notched, seeping,",
    "yet eerily polished, as if at last defined.",
    "Your map of me? Let your pencil trace",
    "the old quarries and splintered outcrops,",
    "let it analyze the faults, describe their throes,",
    "let it reveal how the light is laid over them all."

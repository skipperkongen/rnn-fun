    "I. AT TEN",
    "1955. A scratchy waltz",
    "Buzzed over the ice rink\u2019s P.A.",
    "My classmate Tony, the barber\u2019s son: \u201cAlls",
    "He wantsa do is, you know, like, play.\u201d",
    "Bored with perfecting my languid figure eights,",
    "I trailed him to a basement door marked GENTS",
    "With its metal silhouette of high-laced skates",
    "(Symbols, I guess, of methods desire invents).",
    "Tony\u2019s older brother was waiting inside.",
    "I\u2019d been \u201crequested,\u201d it seemed. He was sixteen,",
    "Tall, rawboned, blue-eyed,",
    "Thumbs hooked into faded, tightening jeans.",
    "I fumbled with small talk, pretending to be shy.",
    "Looking past me, he slowly unzipped his fly.",
    "II. CALLAS",
    "Her voice: steeped in a rancid syrupy phlegm:",
    "Whatever\u2019s not believed remains a grace",
    "While again she invokes the power that yields:",
    "Splintered timber and quick consuming flame:",
    "The simplest way to take hold of the heart\u2019s",
    "Complications, its pool of spilt religion:",
    "A long black hair sweat-stuck to the skin:",
    "The bitter sleep of the dying: the Jew in Berlin:",
    "Who sent you here? the sharp blade pleads:",
    "Stormcloud: thornhedge: starchill:",
    "Blood bubble floating to the top of the glass:",
    "The light, from fleshrise to soulset:",
    "The world dragging the slow weight of its shame",
    "Like the train of pomp: guttering candle: her voice.",
    "III. IN CLASS",
    "Parasangs, satraps, the daily drill . . .",
    "Beginner\u2019s Greek its own touchstone.",
    "The sophomore teacher was Father Moan,",
    "Whom I longed to have praise my skill.",
    "The illustrated reader\u2019s best",
    "Accounts of murder and sacrifice",
    "Only suggested the heavy price",
    "I longed to pay at his behest.",
    "He\u2019d slap the pointer against his thigh.",
    "I quivered. What coldness may construe",
    "Of devotion was an experience",
    "As hard to learn as catch his eye.",
    "I kept my hand up.",
    "I knew",
    "The right answer. The case. The tense."

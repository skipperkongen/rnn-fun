    "HORACE IV. i",
    "It\u2019s over, love. Look at me pushing fifty now,",
    "Hair like grave-grass growing in both ears,",
    "The piles and boggy prostate, the crooked penis,",
    "The sour taste of each day\u2019s first lie,",
    "And that recurrent dream of years ago pulling",
    "A swaying bead-chain of moonlight,",
    "Of slipping between the cool sheets of dark",
    "Along a body like my own, but blameless.",
    "What good\u2019s my cut-glass conversation now,",
    "Now I\u2019m so effortlessly vulgar and sad?",
    "You get from life what you can shake from it?",
    "For me, it\u2019s g and t\u2019s all day and CNN.",
    "Try the blond boychick lawyer, entry level",
    "At eighty grand, who pouts about overtime,",
    "Keeps Evian and a beeper in his locker at the gym,",
    "And hash in tinfoil under the office fern.",
    "There\u2019s your hound from heaven, with buccaneer",
    "Curls and perfumed war-paint on his nipples.",
    "His answering machine always has room for one more",
    "Slurred, embarrassed call from you-know-who.",
    "Some nights I\u2019ve laughed so hard the tears",
    "Won\u2019t stop. Look at me now. Why",
    "?",
    "I long ago gave up pretending to believe",
    "Anyone\u2019s memory will give as good as it gets.",
    "So why these stubborn tears? And why do I dream",
    "Almost every night of holding you again,",
    "Or at least of diving after you, my long-gone,",
    "Through the bruised unbalanced waves?"

    "Up early, trying to muffle",
    "the sounds of small tasks,",
    "grinding, pouring, riffling",
    "through yesterday\u2019s attacks",
    "or market slump, then changing",
    "my mind\u2014what matter the rush",
    "to the waiting room or the ring",
    "of some later dubious excuse?\u2014",
    "having decided to return to bed",
    "and finding you curled in the sheet,",
    "a dream fluttering your eyelids,",
    "still unfallen, still asleep,",
    "I thought of the old pilgrim",
    "when, among the fixed stars",
    "in paradise, he sees Adam",
    "suddenly, the first man, there",
    "in a flame that hides his body,",
    "and when it moves to speak,",
    "what is inside seems not free,",
    "not happy, but huge and weak,",
    "like an animal in a sack.",
    "Who had captured him?",
    "What did he want to say?",
    "I lay down beside you again,",
    "not knowing if I\u2019d stay,",
    "not knowing where I\u2019d been."

    "In the men\u2019s room at the office today",
    "some wag has labelled the two stalls",
    "the",
    "and the",
    ".",
    "The second seems suitable for the results",
    "of my business, not for what thinking",
    "ordinarily accompanies it.",
    "So I\u2019ve locked myself into the first because,",
    "though farther from the lightbulb overhead,",
    "it remains the more conventional",
    "and thereby illuminating choice.",
    "The wit on its walls is more desperate.",
    "As if I had written them",
    "there myself, but only because by now",
    "I have seen them day after day,",
    "I know each boast, each plea,",
    "the runty widower\u2019s resentments,",
    "the phone number for good head.",
    "Today\u2019s fresh drawing:",
    "a woman\u2019s torso, neck to outflung knees,",
    "with breasts like targets and at her crotch",
    "red felt-tip \u201chair\u201d to guard",
    "a treasure half wound, half wisecrack.",
    "The first critic of the flesh is always",
    "the self-possessed sensualist.",
    "With all that wall as his margin,",
    "he had sniffed in smug ballpoint",
    "OBVIOUSLY DONE BY SOMEONE",
    "WHO HAS NEVER SEEN THE REAL THING.",
    "Under that, in a later hand,",
    "the local pinstripe aesthete",
    "had dismissed the daydreamer\u2019s crudity",
    "and its critic\u2019s edgy literalism.",
    "His block letters had squared,",
    "not sloping shoulders: NO,",
    "BY SOMEONE WHO JUST CAN\u2019T DRAW.",
    "Were the two opinions",
    "converging on the same moral point?",
    "That a good drawing",
    "the real thing?",
    "Or that the real thing",
    "can be truly seen only through another\u2019s",
    "eyes? But now that I trace it through",
    "other jokes and members,",
    "the bottom line leads to a higher inch",
    "of free space on the partition\u2014",
    "a perch above the loose",
    "remarks, like the pimp\u2019s doorway",
    "or the Zen master\u2019s cliff-face ledge.",
    "THERE ARE NO REAL THINGS",
    "writes the philosopher. But he too",
    "has been misled by everything",
    "the mind makes of a body.",
    "When the torso is fleshed out",
    "and turns over in the artist\u2019s bed,",
    "when the sensualist sobs over her,",
    "when the critic buttons his pants,",
    "when the philosopher\u2019s scorn sinks back",
    "from a gratified ecstasy,",
    "then it will be clear to each",
    "in his own way. There is nothing",
    "we cannot possibly not know."

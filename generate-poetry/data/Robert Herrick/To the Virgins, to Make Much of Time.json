    "Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,",
    "Old Time is still a-flying;",
    "And this same flower that smiles today",
    "Tomorrow will be dying.",
    "The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,",
    "The higher he\u2019s a-getting,",
    "The sooner will his race be run,",
    "And nearer he\u2019s to setting.",
    "That age is best which is the first,",
    "When youth and blood are warmer;",
    "But being spent, the worse, and worst",
    "Times still succeed the former.",
    "Then be not coy, but use your time,",
    "And while ye may, go marry;",
    "For having lost but once your prime,",
    "You may forever tarry."

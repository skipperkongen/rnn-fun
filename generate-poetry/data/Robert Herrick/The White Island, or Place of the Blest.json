    "In this world, the isle of dreams,",
    "While we sit by sorrow\u2019s streams,",
    "Tears and terrors are our themes",
    "Reciting:",
    "But when once from hence we fly,",
    "More and more approaching nigh",
    "Unto young eternity,",
    "Uniting:",
    "In that whiter island, where",
    "Things are evermore sincere;",
    "Candor here and luster there",
    "Delighting:",
    "There no monstrous fancies shall",
    "Out of hell an horror call,",
    "To create, or cause at all,",
    "Affrighting.",
    "There, in calm and cooling sleep",
    "We our eyes shall never steep,",
    "But eternal watch shall keep,",
    "Attending",
    "Pleasures, such as shall pursue",
    "Me immortalized, and you;",
    "And fresh joys, as never too",
    "Have ending."

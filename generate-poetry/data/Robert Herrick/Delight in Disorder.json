    "A sweet disorder in the dress",
    "Kindles in clothes a wantonness;",
    "A lawn about the shoulders thrown",
    "Into a fine distraction;",
    "An erring lace, which here and there",
    "Enthrals the crimson stomacher;",
    "A cuff neglectful, and thereby",
    "Ribands to flow confusedly;",
    "A winning wave, deserving note,",
    "In the tempestuous petticoat;",
    "A careless shoe-string, in whose tie",
    "I see a wild civility:",
    "Do more bewitch me, than when art",
    "Is too precise in every part."

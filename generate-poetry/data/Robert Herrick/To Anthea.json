    "Let\u2019s call for Hymen if agreed thou art \u2013",
    "Delays in love but crucify the heart.",
    "Love\u2019s thorny tapers yet neglected lie;",
    "Speak thou the word, they\u2019ll kindle by and by.",
    "The nimble hours woo us on to wed,",
    "And Genius waits to have us both to bed.",
    "Behold, for us the naked Graces stay",
    "With maunds of roses for us to strew the way.",
    "Besides, the most religious prophet stands",
    "Ready to join as well our hearts as hands.",
    "June yet smiles; but if she chance to chide,",
    "Ill luck \u2019twill bode to th\u2019bridegroom and the bride.",
    "Tell me Anthea, dost thou fondly dread",
    "The loss of that we call a maidenhead?",
    "Come, I\u2019ll instruct thee. Know, the vestal fire",
    "Is not by marriage quenched, but flames the higher."

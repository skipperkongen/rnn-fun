    "There are two memories of tides:",
    "one for the deep blackness that split",
    "away from the mother sea",
    "and one for sea that found itself",
    "in the daybreaks of rivers.",
    "Yet it was all one sea",
    "tracked by comets and the Elegant Tern,",
    "seals in speckled pod-shaped skins,",
    "and whales, opening their small eyes",
    "when the hands of people drew fish",
    "out of the salt.",
    "Geologists tell us that the sea split",
    "millions of years ago",
    "before the Yoemem, Yoremem,",
    "Kunkaak, O-Otam",
    "curled their tongues around the names",
    "of themselves and raised the conch shell",
    "to their lips, so that the sound of nature",
    "became human, too:",
    "Then the sea was measured",
    "and divided into leagues.",
    "The Spanish ships called it",
    "because the sea tore in two ways,",
    "tide and rivers,",
    "so they contained it in maps",
    "written on dead animal skins",
    "with ink made from dried octopus blood",
    "Golfo de California",
    "Then it was named the",
    "when the red-shelled crabs clicked in the waters.",
    "It was the",
    "because it\u2019s the right of the Conqueror",
    "to claim the world in his name.",
    "It\u2019s his right to name hunger after himself",
    "and to take away rivers",
    "and children",
    "and to give back the bare bones",
    "of life",
    "in the Queen\u2019s name.",
    "What can you say about men",
    "who name the mountains \u201cmother\u201d",
    "when the worst curse they can shout",
    "defiles their mother",
    "in the act of creation?",
    "Now we call the Gulf of California",
    "with the pesticides of fields",
    "and the wastes of factories.",
    "And the voices of the fin-backed whale,",
    "sardines, sea-kelp, anemone,",
    "and turtle are quieter,",
    "so that we have less memory",
    "of the way it was",
    "and less hope",
    "for the way it will be.",
    "In the winter I eat strawberries",
    "from Mexico",
    "and oranges, sectioned and split",
    "apart",
    "on my north continental plate.",
    "I don\u2019t know much about my relatives",
    "picking the fields near Bacum, Torim.",
    "I don\u2019t know much about the spiny sea urchin,",
    "except that it knows more than I",
    "about the sea, the sea that names itself",
    "movable horizon."

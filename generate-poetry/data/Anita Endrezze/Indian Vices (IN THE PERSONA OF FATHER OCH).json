    "By nature Indians are very lazy and sworn enemies of work.",
    "They prefer to suffer hunger than to fatigue themselves",
    "with agriculture. Therefore, they must be forced to do this by their",
    "superiors. With six industrious Europeans one can do more",
    "in one day than fifty Indians",
    ", Missionary in Sonora: Travel Reports",
    "of Joseph Och, S.J., 1755-1767",
    "Mining: The Indian is naked, swinging",
    "quarter to half hundredweight steel-edged crowbars.",
    "He climbs beams with notches set step by step,",
    "carrying ore in plaited baskets",
    "on his shoulders.",
    "They are given one half-bushel of maize per week.",
    "This is their payment unless they have a family\u2013",
    "then they are given two half-bushels.",
    "more than can thirty lazy Indians",
    "working an entire day.",
    "They are naked, with only a loincloth.",
    "Otherwise they would steal valuable ore.",
    "Instead they laugh",
    "when their hair is thick with dusted gold",
    "so that they look like ugly yellow-haired creatures.",
    "Their hair is long and they secrete fragments",
    "of ore there, wrapping their hair up",
    "like a turban. You can no more trust them",
    "than you would a Turk.",
    "Some is very heavy, pure",
    "silver spiked, as it were,",
    "with silver nails.",
    "The completely black",
    "very heavy ores",
    "are considered the richest.",
    "The Indian washes his hair",
    "several times a day, sluicing water",
    "over his long hair, letting the silver fall",
    "into a bowl which he then strains,",
    "keeping more silver.",
    "Then again, the Indian must relieve himself",
    "and he hides behind a bush,",
    "thereby stealing more ore",
    "in a most despicable way.",
    "or be broken up",
    "and placed into a clay oven",
    ". . . with molten lead,",
    "until . . . the lead has amalgamated",
    "with the silver.",
    "Pebbles and slag float on top",
    "and are skinned off",
    "with hoes and the lead heated",
    "with a double fire",
    "until it becomes light and frothy",
    "like glass.",
    "This froth is removed in heaps;",
    "what remains is pure silver.",
    "When the Indian dies,",
    "perhaps careless at work, he is wrapped in a horse blanket.",
    "Thread from deer or plant fiber",
    "is used to sew him up.",
    "It is heathen, this practice",
    "of putting bows and arrows,",
    "small bowls, and other things",
    "in the grave. Instead, I pull the bell rope",
    "and they are pleased at the songs",
    "and lighted tapers",
    "on the altar of the whitewashed church.",
    "They die when they want to,",
    "saying they are only journeying",
    "to the next village.",
    "They have many vices",
    "which I have discovered",
    "and abolished, including the throwing",
    "of patterned sticks,",
    "which is like gambling.",
    "They would rather lie on blankets",
    "in the bushes, throwing these sticks",
    "against the rough wool to muffle the sound,",
    "than work in the fields",
    "or in the mines which are very near,",
    "nor do they think of tomorrow",
    "and the profit that must be made,",
    "whether it is gold, silver, maize,",
    "or their heathenish souls."

    "They are so like",
    "Us, frozen in a bald passion",
    "Or absent",
    "Gaze, like the cows whose lashes",
    "Sag beneath their frail sacks of ice.",
    "Your eyes are white with fever, a long",
    "Sickness. When you are asleep,",
    "Dreaming of another country, the wheat\u2019s",
    "Pale surface sliding",
    "In the wind, you are walking in every breath",
    "Away from me. I gave you a stone doll,",
    "Its face a dry apple, wizened, yet untroubled.",
    "It taught us the arrogance of silence,",
    "How stone and God reward us, how dolls give us",
    "Nothing. Look at your cane,",
    "Look how even the touch that wears it away",
    "Draws up a shine, as the handle",
    "Gives to the hand. As a girl, you boiled",
    "Your dolls, to keep them clean, presentable;",
    "You\u2019d stir them in enormous pots,",
    "As the arms and legs bent to those incredible",
    "Postures you preferred, not that ordinary, human",
    "Pose. How would you like me?\u2014",
    "Leaning back, reading aloud from a delirious",
    "Book. Or sprawled across your bed,",
    "As if I\u2019d been tossed off a high building",
    "Into the street,",
    "A lesson from a young government to its people.",
    "When you are asleep, walking the fields of another",
    "Country, a series of shadows slowly falling",
    "Away, marking a way,",
    "The sky leaning like a curious girl above a new",
    "Sister, your face a doll\u2019s deliberate",
    "Ache of white, you walk along that grove of madness,",
    "Where your mother waits. Hungry, very still.",
    "When you are asleep, dreaming of another country,",
    "This is the country."

    "They were sitting on the thin mattress",
    "He\u2019d once rolled & carried up the four floors",
    "To his room only to find it covered nearly all",
    "Of the bare wood",
    "Leaving just a small path alongside the wall",
    "& between them was the sack",
    "Of oranges & pears she\u2019d brought its neck",
    "Turned back to expose the colors of the fruit",
    "& as she opened a bottle of wine",
    "He reached over to a tall stack of books",
    "& pulled out",
    "& with a silly flourish",
    "Handed it across the bed to her she looked up",
    "& simply poured the two squat water glasses",
    "Half-full with wine & then she",
    "Took the book reading silently not aloud",
    "As he\u2019d assumed & suddenly he felt clearly",
    "She knew the way",
    "Two people must come upon such an understanding",
    "Together of course but separately",
    "As the moon & the wave remain individually one"

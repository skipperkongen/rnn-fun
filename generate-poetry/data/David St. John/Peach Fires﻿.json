    "Out in the orchards the dogs stood",
    "Almost frozen in the bleak spring night",
    "& Mister dragged out into the rows",
    "Between his peach trees the old dry limbs",
    "Building at regular intervals careful pyres",
    "While the teeth of the dogs chattered & snapped",
    "& the ice began to hang long as whiskers",
    "From the globes along the branches",
    "& at his signal we set the piles of branches ablaze",
    "Tending each carefully so as not to scorch",
    "The trees as we steadily fed those flames",
    "Just enough to send a rippling glow along",
    "Those acres of orchard where that body\u2014",
    "Sister Winter\u2014had been held so wisely to the fire"

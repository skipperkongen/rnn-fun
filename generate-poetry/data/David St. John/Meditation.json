    "Quiet now, sorrow; relax. Calm down, fear ...",
    "You wanted the night? It\u2019s falling, here,",
    "Like a black glove onto the city,",
    "Giving a few some peace ... but not me.",
    "I think, well, almost everyone I know",
    "Loves to be whipped by pleasure\u2014right, Killer?\u2014",
    "As they stroll the boardwalk, parading their despair.",
    "So why don\u2019t you come too? But instead, with me,",
    "Away from all these tattered ghosts leaning off",
    "The sky\u2019s balcony like last year\u2019s lovers;",
    "We\u2019ll watch everything we regret step from the sea",
    "Dripping ... while the dead sun drags its arc",
    "Towards China. Shroud of my heart, listen. Listen\u2014",
    "How softly the night steps toward us."

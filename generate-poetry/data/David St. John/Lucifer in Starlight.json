    "It was something I\u2019d overheard",
    "One evening at a party; a man I liked enormously",
    "Saying to a mutual friend, a woman",
    "Wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips",
    "That belled below each breast, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve always",
    "Preferred Athens; Greece seems to me a country",
    "Of the day\u2014Rome, I\u2019m afraid, strikes me",
    "As being a city of the night ... \u201d",
    "Of course, I knew instantly just what he meant\u2014",
    "Not simply because I love",
    "Standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening",
    "As the constellations pulse low in the Roman sky,",
    "The whole mind of night that I know so well",
    "Shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite,",
    "Almost divine irony. No, and it wasn\u2019t only that Rome",
    "Was",
    "city of the night, that it was here I\u2019d chosen",
    "To live when I grew tired of my ancient life",
    "As the Underground Man. And it wasn\u2019t that Rome\u2019s darkness",
    "Was of the kind that consoles so many",
    "Vacancies of the soul; my Rome, with its endless history",
    "Of falls ... No, it was that this dark was the deep, sensual dark",
    "Of the dreamer; this dark was like the violet fur",
    "Spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of",
    "The She-Wolf\u2014all the sequins above in sequence,",
    "The white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians,",
    "A dark like the polished back of a mirror,",
    "The pool of the night scalloped and hanging",
    "Above me, the inverted reflection of a last,",
    "Odd Narcissus ...",
    "One night my friend Nico came by",
    "Close to three",
    "\u2014As we drank a little wine, I could see",
    "The black of her pupils blown wide,",
    "The spread ripples of the opiate night ... And Nico",
    "Pulled herself close to me, her mouth almost",
    "Touching my mouth, as she sighed, \u201cLook ... ,\u201d",
    "And deep within the pupil of her left eye,",
    "Almost like the mirage of a ship\u2019s distant, hanging",
    "Lantern rocking with the waves,",
    "I could see, at the most remote end of the receding,",
    "Circular hallway of her eye, there, at its doorway,",
    "At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil,",
    "A tiny, dangling crucifix\u2014",
    "Silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting",
    "In her as quietly as pain, as simply as pain ...",
    "Some years later, I saw Nico on stage in New York, singing",
    "Inside loosed sheets of shattered light, a fluid",
    "Kaleidoscope washing over her\u2014the way any naked,",
    "Emerging Venus steps up along the scalloped lip",
    "Of her shell, innocent and raw as fate, slowly",
    "Obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple, deadly",
    "Love of sexual sincerity ...",
    "I didn\u2019t bother to say hello. I decided to remember",
    "The way in Rome, out driving at night, she\u2019d laugh as she let",
    "Her head fall back against the cracked, red leather",
    "Of my old Lancia\u2019s seats, the soft black wind",
    "Fanning her pale, chalky hair out along its currents,",
    "Ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves;",
    "The sad, lucent malevolence of the heavens, falling ...",
    "Both of us racing silently as light. Nowhere,",
    "Then forever ...",
    "Into the mind of the Roman night."

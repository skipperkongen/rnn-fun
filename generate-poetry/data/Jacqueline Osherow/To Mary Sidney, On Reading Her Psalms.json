    "clearly palpable in all your artistry.",
    "It was your eagerness to be with him",
    "that kept you going back to intervene",

    "got you through all hundred-fifty psalms.",
    "Or maybe it was just your poet\u2019s ruse",

    "to trick yourself to rise to his occasion. . . .",
    "Unless he just provided the excuse",
    "to stake your own (quite vast) poetic claims,",
    "impossible to say from this vantage point:",
    "to distinguish collaborator from muse,",
    "self-doubt from false humility",
    "but, then again, there\u2019s a poetry in mystery.",

    "for even fragments of poems by a woman.",
    "But of course you weren\u2019t troubled by inequity\u2014",
    "it was, frankly, all you knew\u2014",
    "you might even have relished your position",
    "as sole woman poet, thinker, patron\u2014",
    "lonely as it was\u2014though you did encourage",
    "your precocious niece, Mary (later Wroth).",
    "And who can really estimate the damage",
    "of your appalling bargain: a brother\u2019s death",
    "required to turn you into poet?",
    "Of course, in your time, death was everywhere.",

    "to shore up an attenuated heart",
    "against even further disrepair,",
    "immersion in the psalms a sort of antidote",
    "to life\u2019s massive overdose of pain:",
    "from living with a sad, disfigured mother",
    "(small-pox scars from nursing a sick queen)",
    "mourning her husband\u2019s lost affection",
    "to deaths of favorites\u2014your sister, your brother,",
    "your only daughters, Katherine, then Anne.",
    "Excellent advice, if it would hold\u2014",
    "And maybe it does, when you can summon",
    "to distract you with a binge of exaltation . . .",
    "or if that fails, then an assiduous",

    "a treasure, even, for an exacting Queen\u2014",
    "offering a deity who\u2019ll listen",
    "to a voice alternately humble, bold,",
    "beseeching, thankful, ecstatic, bleak,",

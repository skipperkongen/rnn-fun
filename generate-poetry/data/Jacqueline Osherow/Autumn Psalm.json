    "A full year passed (the seasons keep me honest)",
    "since I last noticed this same commotion.",
    "Who knew God was an abstract expressionist?",
    "I\u2019m asking myself\u2014the very question",
    "I asked last year, staring out at this array",
    "of racing colors, then set in motion",
    "by the chance invasion of a Steller\u2019s jay.",
    "Is",
    "what people mean by",
    "My usually levelheaded mulberry tree",
    "hurling arrows everywhere in sight\u2014",
    "its bow: the out-of-control Virginia creeper",
    "my friends say I should do something about,",
    "whose vermilion went at least a full shade deeper",
    "at the provocation of the upstart blue,",
    "the leaves (half green, half gold) suddenly hyper",
    "in savage competition with that red and blue\u2014",
    "tohubohu returned, in living color.",
    "Kandinsky: where were you when I needed you?",
    "My attempted poem would lie fallow a year;",
    "I was so busy focusing on the desert\u2019s",
    "stinginess with everything but rumor.",
    "No place even for the spectrum\u2019s introverts\u2014",
    "rose, olive, gray\u2014no pigment at all\u2014",
    "and certainly no room for shameless braggarts",
    "like the ones that barge in here every fall",
    "and make me feel like an unredeemed failure",
    "even more emphatically than usual.",
    "And here they are again, their fleet allure",
    "still more urgent this time\u2014the desert\u2019s gone;",
    "I\u2019m through with it, want something fuller\u2014",
    "why shouldn\u2019t a person have a little fun,",
    "some utterly unnecessary extravagance?",
    "Which was\u2014at least I think it was\u2014God\u2019s plan",
    "when He set up (such things are never left to chance)",
    "that one split-second assignation",
    "with genuine, no-kidding-around omnipotence",
    "what, for lack of better words, I\u2019m calling",
    "You breathe in, and, for once, there\u2019s something there.",
    "Just when you thought you\u2019d learned some resignation,",
    "there\u2019s real resistance in the nearby air",
    "until the entire universe is swayed.",
    "Even that desert of yours isn\u2019t quite so bare",
    "and God\u2019s not nonexistent; He\u2019s just been waylaid",
    "by a host of what no one could\u2019ve foreseen.",
    "He\u2019s got plans for you: this red-gold-green parade",
    "is actually a fairly detailed outline.",
    "David never needed one, but he\u2019s long dead",
    "and God could use a little recognition.",
    "He promises. It won\u2019t go to His head",
    "and if you praise Him properly (an autumn psalm!",
    "Why didn\u2019t",
    "think of that?) you\u2019ll have it made.",
    "But while it\u2019s true that my Virginia creeper praises Him,",
    "its palms and fingers crimson with applause,",
    "that the local breeze is weaving Him a diadem,",
    "inspecting my tree\u2019s uncut gold for flaws,",
    "I came to talk about the way that violet-blue",
    "sprang the greens and reds and yellows",
    "into action: actual motion. I swear it\u2019s true",
    "though I\u2019m not sure I ever took it in.",
    "Now I\u2019d be prepared, if some magician flew",
    "into my field of vision, to realign",
    "that dazzle out my window yet again.",
    "It\u2019s not likely, but I\u2019m keeping my eyes open",
    "though I still wouldn\u2019t be able to explain",
    "precisely what happened to these vines, these trees.",
    "It isn\u2019t available in my tradition.",
    "For this, I would have to be Chinese,",
    "Wang Wei, to be precise, on a mountain,",
    "autumn rain converging on the trees,",
    "a cassia flower nearby, a cloud, a pine,",
    "washerwomen heading home for the day,",
    "my senses and the mountain so entirely in tune",
    "that when my stroke of blue arrives, I\u2019m ready.",
    "Though there is no rain here: the air\u2019s shot through",
    "with gold on golden leaves. Wang Wei\u2019s so giddy",
    "he\u2019s calling back the dead:",
    "Guys! You\u2019ve got to see this\u2014autumn sun!",
    "They\u2019re suddenly hell-bent on learning Hebrew",
    "in order to get inside the celebration,",
    "which explains how they wound up where they are",
    "in my university library\u2019s squashed domain.",
    "Poor guys, it was Hebrew they were looking for,",
    "but they ended up across the aisle from Yiddish\u2014",
    "some Library of Congress cataloger\u2019s sense of humor:",
    "the world\u2019s calmest characters and its most skittish",
    "squinting at each other, head to head,",
    "all silently intoning some version of kaddish",
    "for their nonexistent readers, one side\u2019s dead",
    "(the twentieth century\u2019s lasting contribution)",
    "and the other\u2019s insufficiently learned",
    "to understand a fraction of what they mean.",
    "The writings in the world\u2019s most spoken language",
    "across from one that can barely get a minyan.",
    "Sick of",
    "the",
    "are trying to engage",
    "the guys across the aisle in some conversation:",
    "into so few words, respectfully asks Glatstein.",
    "Wang Wei, at first, doesn\u2019t understand the problem",
    "but then he shrugs his shoulders, mumbles",
    "... but, please, I, myself, overheard a poem,",
    "in the autumn rain, once, on a mountain.",
    "How do you do it? I believe it\u2019s called a psalm?",
    "Glatstein\u2019s cronies all crack up in unison.",
    "give him an answer.",
    "But Glatstein dons his yarmulke (who knew he had one?)",
    "and starts the introduction to the morning prayer,",
    "psalm by psalm.",
    "Wang Wei is spellbound, the stacks\u2019 stale air",
    "suddenly a veritable balm",
    "and I\u2019m so touched by these amazing goings-on",
    "that I\u2019ve forgotten all about the autumn",
    "staring straight at me: still alive, still golden.",
    "What\u2019s gold, anyway, compared to poetry?",
    "a trick of chlorophyll, a trick of sun.",
    "True. It was something, my changing tree",
    "with its perfect complement: a crimson vine,",
    "both thrown into panic by a Steller\u2019s jay,",
    "but it\u2019s hard to shake the habit of digression.",
    "Wandering has always been my people\u2019s way",
    "whether we\u2019re in a desert or narration.",
    "It\u2019s too late to emulate Wang Wei",
    "and his solitary years on that one mountain",
    "though I\u2019d love to say what I set out to say",
    "just once. Next autumn, maybe.",
    "Glatstein will shout over to me from the bookcase",
    "(that is, if he\u2019s paying any attention)",
    "and, finally, I\u2019ll look him in the face."

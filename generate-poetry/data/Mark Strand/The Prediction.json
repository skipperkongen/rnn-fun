    "That night the moon drifted over the pond,",
    "turning the water to milk, and under",
    "the boughs of the trees, the blue trees,",
    "a young woman walked, and for an instant",
    "the future came to her:",
    "rain falling on her husband\u2019s grave, rain falling",
    "on the lawns of her children, her own mouth",
    "filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house,",
    "a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it,",
    "a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death,",
    "thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising",
    "and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark."

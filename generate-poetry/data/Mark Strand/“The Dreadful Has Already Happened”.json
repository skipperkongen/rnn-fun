    "The relatives are leaning over, staring expectantly.",
    "They moisten their lips with their tongues. I can feel",
    "them urging me on. I hold the baby in the air.",
    "Heaps of broken bottles glitter in the sun.",
    "A small band is playing old fashioned marches.",
    "My mother is keeping time by stamping her foot.",
    "My father is kissing a woman who keeps waving",
    "to somebody else. There are palm trees.",
    "The hills are spotted with orange flamboyants and tall",
    "billowy clouds move behind them. \u201cGo on, Boy,\u201d",
    "I hear somebody say, \u201cGo on.\u201d",
    "I keep wondering if it will rain.",
    "The sky darkens. There is thunder.",
    "\u201cBreak his legs,\u201d says one of my aunts,",
    "\u201cNow give him a kiss.\u201d I do what I\u2019m told.",
    "The trees bend in the bleak tropical wind.",
    "The baby did not scream, but I remember that sigh",
    "when I reached inside for his tiny lungs and shook them",
    "out in the air for the flies. The relatives cheered.",
    "It was about that time I gave up.",
    "Now, when I answer the phone, his lips",
    "are in the receiver; when I sleep, his hair is gathered",
    "around a familiar face on the pillow; wherever I search",
    "I find his feet. He is what is left of my life."

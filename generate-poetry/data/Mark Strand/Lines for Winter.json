    "Tell yourself",
    "as it gets cold and gray falls from the air",
    "that you will go on",
    "walking, hearing",
    "the same tune no matter where",
    "you find yourself\u2014",
    "inside the dome of dark",
    "or under the cracking white",
    "of the moon's gaze in a valley of snow.",
    "Tonight as it gets cold",
    "tell yourself",
    "what you know which is nothing",
    "but the tune your bones play",
    "as you keep going. And you will be able",
    "for once to lie down under the small fire",
    "of winter stars.",
    "And if it happens that you cannot",
    "go on or turn back",
    "and you find yourself",
    "where you will be at the end,",
    "tell yourself",
    "in that final flowing of cold through your limbs",
    "that you love what you are."

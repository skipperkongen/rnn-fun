    "Not every man knows what he shall sing at the end,",
    "Watching the pier as the ship sails away, or what it will seem like",
    "When he\u2019s held by the sea\u2019s roar, motionless, there at the end,",
    "Or what he shall hope for once it is clear that he\u2019ll never go back.",
    "When the time has passed to prune the rose or caress the cat,",
    "When the sunset torching the lawn and the full moon icing it down",
    "No longer appear, not every man knows what he\u2019ll discover instead.",
    "When the weight of the past leans against nothing, and the sky",
    "Is no more than remembered light, and the stories of cirrus",
    "And cumulus come to a close, and all the birds are suspended in flight,",
    "Not every man knows what is waiting for him, or what he shall sing",
    "When the ship he is on slips into darkness, there at the end."

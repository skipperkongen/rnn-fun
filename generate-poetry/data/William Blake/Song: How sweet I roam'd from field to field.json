    "How sweet I roam'd from field to field,",
    "And tasted all the summer's pride,",
    "'Till I the prince of love beheld,",
    "Who in the sunny beams did glide!",
    "He shew'd me lilies for my hair,",
    "And blushing roses for my brow;",
    "He led me through his gardens fair,",
    "Where all his golden pleasures grow.",
    "With sweet May dews my wings were wet,",
    "And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage;",
    "He caught me in his silken net,",
    "And shut me in his golden cage.",
    "He loves to sit and hear me sing,",
    "Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;",
    "Then stretches out my golden wing,",
    "And mocks my loss of liberty."

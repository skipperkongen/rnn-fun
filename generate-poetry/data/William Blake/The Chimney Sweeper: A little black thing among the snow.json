    "A little black thing among the snow,",

    "\"Where are thy father and mother? say?\"",
    "\"They are both gone up to the church to pray.",
    "Because I was happy upon the heath,",
    "And smil'd among the winter's snow,",
    "They clothed me in the clothes of death,",
    "And taught me to sing the notes of woe.",
    "And because I am happy and dance and sing,",
    "They think they have done me no injury,",
    "And are gone to praise God and his Priest and King,",
    "Who make up a heaven of our misery.\""

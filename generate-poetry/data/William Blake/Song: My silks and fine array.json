    "His face is fair as heav'n,",
    "When springing buds unfold;",
    "O why to him was't giv'n,",

    "Where all love's pilgrims come.",
    "Bring me an axe and spade,",
    "Bring me a winding sheet;",
    "When I my grave have made,",
    "Let winds and tempests beat:",
    "Then down I'll lie, as cold as clay.",
    "True love doth pass away!"

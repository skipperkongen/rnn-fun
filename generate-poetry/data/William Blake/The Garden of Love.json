    "I went to the Garden of Love,",
    "And saw what I never had seen:",
    "A Chapel was built in the midst,",
    "Where I used to play on the green.",
    "And the gates of this Chapel were shut,",
    "And Thou shalt not. writ over the door;",
    "So I turn'd to the Garden of Love,",
    "That so many sweet flowers bore.",
    "And I saw it was filled with graves,",
    "And tomb-stones where flowers should be:",
    "And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,",
    "And binding with briars, my joys & desires."

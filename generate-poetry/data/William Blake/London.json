    "I wander thro' each charter'd street,",

    "In every cry of every Man,",
    "In every Infants cry of fear,",
    "In every voice: in every ban,",
    "The mind-forg'd manacles I hear",
    "How the Chimney-sweepers cry",
    "Every blackning Church appalls,",
    "And the hapless Soldiers sigh",
    "Runs in blood down Palace walls",
    "But most thro' midnight streets I hear",
    "How the youthful Harlots curse",
    "Blasts the new-born Infants tear",
    "And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse"

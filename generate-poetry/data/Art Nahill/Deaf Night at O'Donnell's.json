    "I happen in",
    "from another unremarkable",
    "Tuesday in the realm",
    "of gratuitous sound, but here,",
    "I can hear again",
    "the quiet voices of the ontological,",
    "the clink of ice cubes",
    "in uplifted glasses,",
    "the scrape of chairs,",
    "the mournful lowing of floorboards,",
    "the long history of blood",
    "retold in my ears.",
    "I scuffle to the bar, thoughts",
    "drowned",
    "by my suddenly thunderous",
    "presence in this world,",
    "and the silence flowing",
    "from the neon jukebox,",
    "the silence going down",
    "smooth as the shot",
    "of loneliness that would",
    "naturally follow",
    "a Billie Holiday song",
    "if one were playing\u2014",
    "\u2014while everywhere hands",
    "are fluttering like sheets",
    "in winds of gossip,",
    "hollering above last call",
    "for one more round."

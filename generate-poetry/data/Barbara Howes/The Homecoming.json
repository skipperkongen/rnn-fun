    "All the great voyagers return",
    "Homeward as on an arc of thought;",
    "Home like a ruby beacon burns",
    "As they crest wind, scale wave, soar air;",
    "All the great voyagers return,",
    "Though we who wait never have done",
    "Fearing the piteous accidents,",
    "The coral reef sharp as the bones",
    "It has betrayed, fate\u2019s cormorant",
    "Unleashed, whose diving\u2019s never done.",
    "Even the voyager of mind",
    "May fail beneath behemoth\u2019s weight;",
    "Oh, the world\u2019s bawdy carcass blinds",
    "All but the boldest, rots the sails",
    "And swamps the voyaging of the mind.",
    "But all the great voyagers return",
    "Home like the hunter, like the hare",
    "To its burrow; below, earth\u2019s axle turns",
    "To speed their coming, the following fair",
    "Winds bless their voyage, blow their safe return."

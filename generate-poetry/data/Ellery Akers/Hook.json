    "One year a general",

    "Skin grows back. Scars fade. Eyes clear.",
    "Look at the trees at the burn, six years later.",
    "Look at the sprout on a hay bale",
    "on a truck. Look at the woman who was raped,",
    "had her hands cut off in a creek:",
    "She\u2019s getting married.",
    "The choir sings. The bride smiles.",
    "The groom slips a ring on her hook."

    "One thing you know when you say it:",

    "it could get lost in the air",
    "as it floats up to God like the feather it is,",

    "falling back to earth as rain,",
    "as pellets of ice, soaking a black branch,",
    "collecting in drains, leaching into the ground,",
    "and you walk in that weather every day."

    "It\u2019s like so many other things in life",
    "to which you must say no or yes.",

    "Sometimes the best thing to do is trust.",
    "The package left with the disreputable-looking",
    "clerk, the check gulped by the night deposit,",
    "the envelope passed by dozens of strangers\u2014",
    "all show up at their intended destinations.",
    "The theft that could have happened doesn\u2019t.",
    "Wind finally gets where it was going",
    "through the snowy trees, and the river, even",
    "when frozen, arrives at the right place.",
    "And sometimes you sense how faithfully your life",
    "is delivered, even though you can\u2019t read the address."

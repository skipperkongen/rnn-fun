    "house contained so many voices?",
    "The sound they make is the pure sound",
    "of life\u2019s hunger. Who hangs our house",
    "in the world\u2019s branches, and listens",
    "when we sing from our hunger?",
    "Because I love best those songs",
    "that shake the house of the singer,",
    "I am a student of wrens."

    "This is a letter to the worm-threaded earth.",
    "This is a letter to November, its gray bowl of sky riven by black-branched trees.",
    "A letter to split-tomato skins, overripe apples, & a flock of fruit flies lifting",
    "from the blueing clementines\u2019 wood crate.",
    "To the broken confetti of late fall leaves.",
    "This is a letter to rosemary.",
    "This is a letter to the floor\u2019s sink & creak, the bedroom door\u2019s torn hinge",
    "moaning its good-night.",
    "This is to the unshaven cheek.",
    "To cedar, mothballs, camphor, & last winter\u2019s unwashed wool.",
    "This is a letter to the rediscovered,",
    "to mulch, pine needles, the moon, frost, flats of pansies, the backyard,",
    "hunger, night, the unseen.",
    "This is a letter to soil, thrumming as it waits to be turned.",
    "This is a letter to compost, eggshell\u2019s bone-ash chips, fruit rinds curved like",
    "fingernails, & stale chunks of bread.",
    "A letter to the intimate dark\u2014mouth-warm & damp as a bed.",
    "This is a letter to the planet\u2019s scavenging lips."

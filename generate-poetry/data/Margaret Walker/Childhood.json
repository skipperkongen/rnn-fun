    "When I was a child I knew red miners",
    "dressed raggedly and wearing carbide lamps.",
    "I saw them come down red hills to their camps",
    "dyed with red dust from old Ishkooda mines.",
    "Night after night I met them on the roads,",
    "or on the streets in town I caught their glance;",
    "the swing of dinner buckets in their hands,",
    "and grumbling undermining all their words.",
    "I also lived in low cotton country",
    "where moonlight hovered over ripe haystacks,",
    "or stumps of trees, and croppers\u2019 rotting shacks",
    "with famine, terror, flood, and plague near by;",
    "where sentiment and hatred still held sway",
    "and only bitter land was washed away."

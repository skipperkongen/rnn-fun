    "My monkey-wrench man is my sweet patootie;",
    "the lover of my life, my youth and age.",
    "My heart belongs to him and to him only;",
    "the children of my flesh are his and bear his rage",
    "Now grown to years advancing through the dozens",
    "the honeyed kiss, the lips of wine and fire",
    "fade blissfully into the distant years of yonder",
    "but all my days of Happiness and wonder",
    "are cradled in his arms and eyes entire.",
    "They carry us under the waters of the world",
    "out past the starposts of a distant planet",
    "And creeping through the seaweed of the ocean",
    "they tangle us with ropes and yarn of memories",
    "where we have been together, you and I."

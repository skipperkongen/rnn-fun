    "Transfixed to the, by the, on the congruities, who is herself a vanishing point coming to closure \u2014 dusky flutter \u2014 trilling away like a watchdog on drugged sop, channeling her mother and grandmother who\u2019ve engraved on her locket phrases in script: \u201cglide on a blade\u201d and \u201crustling precedes the shuck.\u201d This is not my teeming fate, my rind, my roiling ellipsis or valedictory spray of myrrh. Always it\u2019s morning, afternoon or evening \u2014 the loot of hours \u2014 a magic sack grasping vacuum but heavy in the hand, and from which, together, we pull a swarm of telepathic bees, melons beached in a green bin, a lithograph of the city from its crumbling ramparts, crackled pitchers and the mouth of a cave. Perhaps this",
    "my open weave, my phantom rialto or plume of light. We bow to each other in the mash of flickering things. We are completely surrounded."

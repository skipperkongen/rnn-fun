    "And still nothing happens. I am not arrested.",
    "By some inexplicable oversight",
    "nobody jeers when I walk down the street.",

    "room. I am not asked to explain my presence",
    "anywhere.",
    "What posthypnotic suggestions were made; and",
    "are any left unexecuted?",
    "Why am I so distressed at the thought of taking",
    "certain jobs?",
    "They are absolutely shameless at the bank\u2014\u2014",
    "You\u2019d think my name meant nothing to them. Non-",
    "chalantly they hand me the sum I\u2019ve requested,",
    "but I know them. It\u2019s like this everywhere\u2014\u2014",

    "They think that they can scare me.",
    "I am always scared.",

    "you!",
    "At no point in the day may I fall to my knees and",
    "refuse to go on, it\u2019s not done.",
    "I go on",
    "dodging cars that jump the curb to crush my hip,",
    "accompanied by abrupt bursts of black-and-white",
    "laughter and applause,",
    "past a million unlighted windows, peered out at",
    "by the retired and their aged attack-dogs\u2014",
    "toward my place,",
    "the one at the end of the counter,",
    "the scalpel on the napkin."

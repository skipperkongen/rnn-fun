    "Is there a single thing in nature",
    "that can approach in mystery",
    "the absolute uniqueness of any human face, first, then",
    "its transformation from childhood to old age\u2014",
    "We are surrounded at every instant",
    "by sights that ought to strike the sane",
    "unbenumbed person tongue-tied, mute",
    "with gratitude and terror. However,",
    "there may be three sane people on earth",
    "at any given time: and if",
    "you got the chance to ask them how they do it,",
    "they would not understand.",
    "I think they might just stare at you",
    "with the embarrassment of pity. Maybe smile",
    "the way you do when children suddenly reveal a secret",
    "preoccupation with their origins, careful not to cause them shame,",
    "on the contrary, to evince the great congratulating pleasure",
    "one feels in the presence of a superior talent and intelligence;",
    "or simply as one smiles to greet a friend who\u2019s waking up,",
    "to prove no harm awaits him, you\u2019ve dealt with and banished all harm."

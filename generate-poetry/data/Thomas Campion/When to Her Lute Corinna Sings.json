    "When to her lute Corinna sings,",
    "Her voice revives the leaden strings,",
    "And doth in highest notes appear",
    "As any challenged echo clear;",
    "But when she doth of mourning speak,",
    "Ev\u2019n with her sighs the strings do break.",
    "And as her lute doth live or die,",
    "Let by her passion, so must I:",
    "For when of pleasure she doth sing,",
    "My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,",
    "But if she doth of sorrow speak,",
    "Ev\u2019n from my heart the strings do break."

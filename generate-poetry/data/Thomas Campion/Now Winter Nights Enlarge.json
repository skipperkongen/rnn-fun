    "Now winter nights enlarge",
    "The number of their hours;",
    "And clouds their storms discharge",
    "Upon the airy towers.",
    "Let now the chimneys blaze",
    "And cups o\u2019erflow with wine,",
    "Let well-turned words amaze",
    "With harmony divine.",
    "Now yellow waxen lights",
    "Shall wait on honey love",
    "While youthful revels, masques, and courtly sights",
    "Sleep\u2019s leaden spells remove.",
    "This time doth well dispense",
    "With lovers\u2019 long discourse;",
    "Much speech hath some defense,",
    "Though beauty no remorse.",
    "All do not all things well;",
    "Some measures comely tread,",
    "Some knotted riddles tell,",
    "Some poems smoothly read.",
    "The summer hath his joys,",
    "And winter his delights;",
    "Though love and all his pleasures are but toys,",
    "They shorten tedious nights."

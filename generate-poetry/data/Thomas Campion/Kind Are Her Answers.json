    "Kind are her answers,",
    "But her performance keeps no day;",
    "Breaks time, as dancers",
    "From their own music when they stray:",
    "All her free favors",
    "And smooth words wing my hopes in vain.",
    "O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?",
    "Can true love yield such delay,",
    "Converting joy to pain?",
    "Lost is our freedom,",
    "When we submit to women so:",
    "Why do we need \u2019em,",
    "When in their best they work our woe?",
    "There is no wisdom",
    "Can alter ends, by Fate prefixed.",
    "O why is the good of man with evil mixed?",
    "Never were days yet called two,",
    "But one night went betwixt."

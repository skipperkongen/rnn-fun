    "Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;",
    "Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.",
    "There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity move,",
    "And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:",
    "But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,",
    "Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.",
    "All that I sung still to her praise did tend,",
    "Still she was first; still she my songs did end;",
    "Yet she my love and music both doth fly,",
    "The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.",
    "Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:",
    "It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her delight."

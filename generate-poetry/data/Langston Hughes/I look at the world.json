    "I look at the world",
    "From awakening eyes in a black face\u2014",
    "And this is what I see:",
    "This fenced-off narrow space",
    "Assigned to me.",
    "I look then at the silly walls",
    "Through dark eyes in a dark face\u2014",
    "And this is what I know:",
    "That all these walls oppression builds",
    "Will have to go!",
    "I look at my own body",
    "With eyes no longer blind\u2014",
    "And I see that my own hands can make",
    "The world that's in my mind.",
    "Then let us hurry, comrades,",
    "The road to find."

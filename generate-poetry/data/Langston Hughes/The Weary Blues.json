    "Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,",
    "Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,",
    "I heard a Negro play.",
    "Down on Lenox Avenue the other night",
    "By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light",
    "He did a lazy sway. . . .",
    "He did a lazy sway. . . .",
    "To the tune o\u2019 those Weary Blues.",
    "With his ebony hands on each ivory key",
    "He made that poor piano moan with melody.",
    "O Blues!",
    "Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool",
    "He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.",
    "Sweet Blues!",
    "Coming from a black man\u2019s soul.",
    "O Blues!",
    "In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone",
    "I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan\u2014",
    "\u201cAin\u2019t got nobody in all this world,",
    "Ain\u2019t got nobody but ma self.",
    "I\u2019s gwine to quit ma frownin\u2019",
    "And put ma troubles on the shelf.\u201d",
    "Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.",
    "He played a few chords then he sang some more\u2014",
    "\u201cI got the Weary Blues",
    "And I can\u2019t be satisfied.",
    "Got the Weary Blues",
    "And can\u2019t be satisfied\u2014",
    "I ain\u2019t happy no mo\u2019",
    "And I wish that I had died.\u201d",
    "And far into the night he crooned that tune.",
    "The stars went out and so did the moon.",
    "The singer stopped playing and went to bed",
    "While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.",
    "He slept like a rock or a man that\u2019s dead."

    "My dearest dust, could not thy hasty day",
    "Afford thy drowzy patience leave to stay",
    "One hower longer: so that we might either",
    "Sate up, or gone to bedd together?",
    "But since thy finisht labor hath possest",
    "Thy weary limbs with early rest,",
    "Enjoy it sweetly: and thy widdowe bride",
    "Shall soone repose her by thy slumbring side.",
    "Whose business, now, is only to prepare",
    "My nightly dress, and call to prayre:",
    "Mine eyes wax heavy and ye day growes old.",
    "The dew falls thick, my beloved growes cold.",
    "Draw, draw ye closed curtaynes: and make room:",
    "My dear, my dearest dust; I come, I come."

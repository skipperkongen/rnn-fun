    "First there were those who died",
    "before I was born.",
    "It was as if they had just left",
    "and their shadows would",
    "slip out after them",
    "under the door so recently closed",
    "the air in its path was still",
    "swirling to rest.",
    "Some of the furniture came from them,",
    "I was told, and one day",
    "I opened two chests",
    "of drawers to learn what the dead kept.",
    "But it was when I learned to read",
    "that I began always",
    "to live among the dead.",
    "I remember Rapunzel,",
    "the improved animals",
    "in the",
    ", and a flock",
    "of birds that saved themselves",
    "from a hunter by flying in place",
    "in the shape of a tree,",
    "their wings imitating the whisk",
    "of wind in the leaves.",
    "My sons and I are like some wine",
    "the dead have already bottled.",
    "They wish us well, but there is nothing",
    "they can do for us.",
    "Sebastian cries in his sleep,",
    "I bring him into my bed,",
    "talk to him, rub his back.",
    "To help his sons live easily",
    "among the dead is a father\u2019s great work.",
    "Now Sebastian drifts, soon he\u2019ll sleep.",
    "We can almost hear the dead",
    "breathing. They sound like water",
    "under a ship at sea.",
    "To love the dead is easy.",
    "They are final, perfect.",
    "But to love a child",
    "is sometimes to fail at love",
    "while the dead look on",
    "with their abstract sorrow.",
    "To love a child is to turn",
    "away from the patient dead.",
    "It is to sleep carefully",
    "in case he cries.",
    "Later, when my sons are grown",
    "among their own dead, I can",
    "dive easily into sleep and loll",
    "among the coral of my dreams",
    "growing on themselves",
    "until at the end",
    "I almost never dream of anyone,",
    "except my sons,",
    "who is still alive."

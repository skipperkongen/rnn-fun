    "The ones his age who shook my hand",
    "on their way out sent fear along",
    "my arm like heroin. These weren\u2019t",
    "men mute about their feelings,",
    "or what\u2019s a body language for?",
    "And I, the glib one, who\u2019d stood",
    "with my back to my father\u2019s body",
    "and praised the heart that attacked him?",
    "I\u2019d made my stab at elegy,",
    "the flesh made word: the very spit",
    "in my mouth was sour with ruth",
    "and eloquence. What could be worse?",
    "Silence, the anthem of my father\u2019s",
    "new country. And thus this babble,",
    "like a dial tone, from our bodies."

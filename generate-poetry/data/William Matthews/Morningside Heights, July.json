    "Haze. Three student violists boarding",
    "a bus. A clatter of jackhammers.",
    "Granular light. A film of sweat for primer",
    "and the heat for a coat of paint.",
    "A man and a woman on a bench:",
    "she tells him he must be psychic,",
    "for how else could he sense, even before she knew,",
    "that she\u2019d need to call it off? A bicyclist",
    "fumes by with a coach\u2019s whistle clamped",
    "hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle",
    "on the boil. I never meant, she says.",
    "But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost",
    "collide; someone yells",
    "in Farsi.",
    "I\u2019m sorry, she says. The comforts",
    "of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon.",
    "The sky blurs\u2014there\u2019s a storm coming",
    "up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly",
    "around a corner. How familiar",
    "it feels to feel strange, hollower",
    "than a bassoon. A rill of chill air",
    "in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail."

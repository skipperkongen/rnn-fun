    "is like a knot",

    "come undone",
    "while you were blinking.",
    "It is bearing something away.",
    "What? What time",
    "does the next snake leave?",
    "This one\u2019s tail is ravelling",
    "into its burrow\u2014",
    "a rosary returned to a purse.",
    "The snake is the last time your spine",
    "could go anywhere alone."

    "There\u2019s a crack in this glass so fine we can\u2019t see it,",
    "and in the blue eye of the candleflame\u2019s needle",
    "there\u2019s a dark fleck, a speck of imperfection",
    "that could contain, like a microchip, an epic",
    "treatise on beauty, except it\u2019s in the eye of the beheld.",
    "And at the base of our glass there\u2019s nothing",
    "so big as a tiny puddle, but an ooze, a viscous",
    "patina like liquefied tarnish. It\u2019s like a text",
    "so short it consists only of the author\u2019s signature,",
    "which has to stand, like the future, for what might",
    "have been: a novel, let\u2019s say, thick with ambiguous life.",
    "Its hero forgets his goal as he nears it, so that it\u2019s",
    "like rain evaporating in the very sight of parched",
    "Saharans on the desert floor. There, by chance, he meets",
    "a thirsty and beautiful woman. What a small world!"

    "literature. It was 1960 at The Showplace, long since",
    "defunct, on West 4th St., and I sat at the bar,",
    "casting beer money from a thin reel of ones,",
    "the kid in the city, big ears like a puppy.",

    "bad poems were dangerous, the way some poets do.",
    "If they were baseball executives they\u2019d plot",

    "and flurried him from the stand.",
    "\u201cWe\u2019ve suffered a diminuendo in personnel,\u201d",
    "he explained, and the band played on."

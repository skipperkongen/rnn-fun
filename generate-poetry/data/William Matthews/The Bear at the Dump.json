    "lightly onto his rear paws and slash",
    "open a plastic bag, and then his nose\u2014",
    "jammed almost with a surfeit of rank",
    "and likely information, for he would pause\u2014",
    "and then his whole dowsing snout would",
    "insinuate itself a little way",
    "inside. By now he\u2019d have hunched his weight",
    "forward slightly, and then he\u2019d snatch it back,",
    "trailed by some tidbit in his teeth. He\u2019d look",

    "decamped for the woods with a marl of grease",
    "and slather in his mouth and on his snout,",
    "picking up speed, not cute (nor had he been",
    "cute before, slavering with greed, his weight",
    "all sunk to his seated rump and his nose stuck",
    "up to sift the rich and fetid air, shaped",
    "like a huge, furry pear), but richly",
    "fed on the slow-simmering dump, and gone",
    "into the bug-thick woods and anecdote."

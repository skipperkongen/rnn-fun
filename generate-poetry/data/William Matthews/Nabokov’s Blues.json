    "to their literary cameo appearances, was too good",
    "a temptation to resist, and if the curator couldn\u2019t,",
    "why should we? The prose dipped and shimmered",
    "and the \u201cflies,\u201d as I heard a buff call them, stood",
    "at lurid attention on their pins. If you love to read",
    "and look, you could be happy a month in that small",

    "brims with indifference to anything not on the page.",
    "The window\u2019s shut. A tiny lamp trails a veil of light",
    "over the page, too far away for us to read.",
    "We also liked the chest of specimen drawers",
    "labeled, as if for apprentice Freudians,",
    "\u201cGenitalia,\u201d wherein languished in phials",
    "the thousands he examined for his monograph",
    "on the Lycaenidae, the silver-studded Blues.",
    "And there in the center of the room a carillon",
    "of Blues rang mutely out. There must have been",
    "three hundred of them. Amanda\u2019s Blue was there,",

    "flew by, and we improvised a path through cars",
    "and slush and boot-high berms of mud-blurred snow",
    "to wherever we went next. I must have been mute,",
    "or whatever I said won from silence nothing",

    "just as you\u2019re having what you wanted most,",

    "than you, or it, or both of you, can bear."

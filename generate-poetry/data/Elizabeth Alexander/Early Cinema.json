    "According to Mister Hedges, the custodian",
    "who called upon their parents",
    "after young Otwiner and young Julia",
    "were spotted at the matinee",
    "of Rudolph Valentino in",
    "at the segregated Knickerbocker Theater",
    "in the uncommon Washington December",
    "of 1922, \u201cYour young ladies",
    "were misrepresenting themselves today,\u201d",
    "meaning, of course, that they were passing.",
    "After coffee and no cake were finished",
    "and Mister Hedges had buttoned his coat",
    "against the strange evening chill,",
    "choice words were had with Otwiner and Julia,",
    "shame upon the family, shame upon the race.",
    "How they\u2019d longed to see Rudolph Valentino,",
    "who was swarthy like a Negro, like the finest Negro man.",
    "In",
    ", they\u2019d heard, he was turbaned,",
    "whisked damsels away in a desert cloud.",
    "They\u2019d heard this from Lucille and Ella",
    "who\u2019d put on their fine frocks and French,",
    "claiming to be \u201cof foreign extraction\u201d",
    "to sneak into the Knickerbocker Theater",
    "past the usher who knew their parents",
    "but did not know them.",
    "They\u2019d heard this from Mignon and Doris",
    "who\u2019d painted carmine bindis on their foreheads",
    "braided their black hair tight down the back,",
    "and huffed, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take this up with the Embassy\u201d",
    "to the squinting ticket taker.",
    "Otwiner and Julia were tired of Oscar Michaux,",
    "tired of church, tired of responsibility,",
    "rectitude, posture, grooming, modulation,",
    "tired of homilies each way they turned,",
    "tired of colored right and wrong.",
    "They wanted to be whisked away.",
    "The morning after Mister Hedges\u2019 visit",
    "the paperboy cried \u201cExtra!\u201d and Papas",
    "shrugged camel\u2019s hair topcoats over pressed pajamas,",
    "and Mamas read aloud at the breakfast table,",
    "\u201cNo Colored Killed When Roof Caves In\u201d",
    "at the Knickerbocker Theater",
    "at the evening show",
    "from a surfeit of snow on the roof.",
    "One hundred others dead.",
    "It appeared that God had spoken.",
    "There was no school that day,",
    "no movies for months after."

    "with serrated fins and a neon spine.",
    "I\u2019m on a train, thinking about my friends",
    "and watching two women talk in sign language.",
    "I feel the energy and heft their talk",
    "generates, the weight of their words in the air",
    "the same heft as your presence in this picture,",
    "boys, the volume of late summer air at the beach.",
    "Did you tea-dance that day? Write poems",
    "in the sunlight? Vamp with strangers? There is",
    "sun under your skin like the gold Sula",
    "found beneath Ajax\u2019s black. I calibrate",
    "the weight of your beautiful bones, the weight",
    "of your elbow, Melvin,",
    "on Darrell\u2019s brown shoulder."

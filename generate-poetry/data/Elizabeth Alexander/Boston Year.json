    "My first week in Cambridge a car full of white boys",
    "tried to run me off the road, and spit through the window,",
    "open to ask directions. I was always asking directions",
    "and always driving: to an Armenian market",
    "in Watertown to buy figs and string cheese, apricots,",
    "dark spices and olives from barrels, tubes of paste",
    "with unreadable Arabic labels. I ate",
    "stuffed grape leaves and watched my lips swell in the mirror.",
    "The floors of my apartment would never come clean.",
    "Whenever I saw other colored people",
    "in bookshops, or museums, or cafeterias, I\u2019d gasp,",
    "smile shyly, but they\u2019d disappear before I spoke.",
    "What would I have said to them? Come with me? Take",
    "me home? Are you my mother? No. I sat alone",
    "in countless Chinese restaurants eating almond",
    "cookies, sipping tea with spoons and spoons of sugar.",
    "Popcorn and coffee was dinner. When I fainted",
    "from migraine in the grocery store, a Portuguese",
    "man above me mouthed: \u201cNo breakfast.\u201d He gave me",
    "orange juice and chocolate bars. The color red",
    "sprang into relief singing Wagner\u2019s",
    ".",
    "Entire tribes gyrated and drummed in my head.",
    "I learned the samba from a Brazilian man",
    "so tiny, so festooned with glitter I was certain",
    "that he slept inside a filigreed, Faberg\u00e9 egg.",
    "No one at the door: no salesmen, Mormons, meter",
    "readers, exterminators, no Harriet Tubman,",
    "no one. Red notes sounding in a grey trolley town."

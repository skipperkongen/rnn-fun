    "Hard to picture, but these Goliath trees",
    "are taller still than Robeson. Outside",
    "vast plate windows in this lecture hall,",

    "He loved the woman",
    "in the lab, Eslanda, who saw order",
    "in swimming circles on inch-wide slides, who",
    "made photographs. I picture her standing",
    "in darkness, led by red light, bathing paper",
    "in broth, extracting images. Did this woman smile",
    "to watch white paper darken, to pull wet",
    "from the chemicals Paul Robeson\u2019s totem face?"

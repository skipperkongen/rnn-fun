    "Her first child belongs to the crows",
    "and his days go circling the yellow-black fields",
    "summers and into the falls. He scans",
    "the horizon, mouth in a sticky O,",
    "like a spirit caged to infinite space.",
    "she calls,",
    "Receding,",
    "he pulls off his straw hat and waves, showing his tuft",
    "of obsidian hair. He\u2019s not coming back just yet.",
    "She remembers how crows are small black rivers",
    "like stairways leading to rooms",
    "that can\u2019t be rooms, only the hallways of space.",
    "And then, how she watched him last night",
    "in the ruined farmhouse across the road",
    "where only a chimney and staircase are left",
    "jutting up to the vacant precincts of moonlight.",
    "He was stepping so lightly then,",
    "who at sixteen forgets his own name, and shits himself",
    "like the mindless, fear-mad prey of barn owls.",
    "He belonged to the crows and stood",
    "for hours on the stairway\u2019s precipice, weaving",
    "a dance like crows in flight, until his brother,",
    "with rope and fists, carried him struggling down."

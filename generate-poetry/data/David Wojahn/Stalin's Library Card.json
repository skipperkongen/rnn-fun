    "Neopolitans, an aged whore whose arms are candlewax,",
    "spirochettes that marinate the blood, x-es",

    "x and asterisks\u2014",
    "all night the margins redden.",
    "THE RIGHT TO KILL",
    "(Moscow: Bezbozhnik, third ed., 1913)",

    "One week to Comrade Stalin's visit,",
    "and the demonstrations must impress:",
    "too much voltage and the corpses combust,",
    "too little and the limbs remain inert",
    "as noodles. Notes scratched on his clipboard, the doctor",
    "scowls to his humpbacked assistant, who hits",
    "the switch.",
    "And Lazarus sizzles\u2014flames emit",
    "from the electroded temples. The good doctor swears",

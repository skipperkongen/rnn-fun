    "How long it must have been, the girl\u2019s hair,",
    "cascading down her shoulders almost to her waist,",
    "light brown and heavy as brocade: the story I\u2019m",
    "remembering of N\u2019s, remembering as my own",
    "hair\u2019s washed and cut, the salt-and-pepper",
    "cuneiform to frill my barber\u2019s smock.",
    "Arts and Science is expanding. The wall",
    "to the empty shop next door pulled down",
    "and a dozen workmen slink improbably",
    "on scaffolds butting the dusty ceiling,",
    "cacophony and plastic tarps, the whirr",
    "of drills that mingles with the dryers\u2019",
    "jittery hums, the scissors\u2019 flash,",
    "veronicas of clicks, the coloring, the curling,",
    "the antique cash register,",
    "melodious with its chime. And best,",
    "the liquid gurgle of hands massaging scalps",
    "the row of sinks, twelve hands and six",
    "wet scalps in a line. I\u2019m next, and leaning back",
    "battered and shiny like the moon)",
    "to the hiss of warm water cataracts",
    "and Andrea\u2019s long fingers. But I\u2019m remembering",
    "the girl in N\u2019s story, the girl",
    "she was at six. This is Birmingham,",
    "1962, Rapunzel-tressed girl",
    "whose parents are more glimpsed than known,",
    "the Family Romance, mid-century American-",

    "for the father\u2019s drink, the far-off lovely",
    "scent of mother\u2019s perfume. More glimpsed",
    "than known, separate phantom lights",
    "edging from beneath closed doors",
    "those nights she couldn\u2019t sleep. Not the Birmingham",
    "of sit-ins, the firehoses trained on",
    "placard-waving crowds. But the Birmingham",
    "of Saturdays when Anne-Marie would arrive",
    "as always on the city bus by six,",
    "before the parents\u2019 cars would pull away.",
    "Then the cleaning until noon, the cooking smells.",
    "And then the big tin basin filled",
    "at the backyard faucet by Anne-Marie,",
    "the long brown fingers in the child\u2019s hair,",
    "the water sluicing, warm from the garden hose,",
    "the soap suds almost flaring, the fingers",
    "ten spokes over scalp and basin, their paths",
    "through the hair and down the child\u2019s back,",
    "the synesthetic grace notes of the hands,",
    "the stitchery, the trill, the body electric,",
    "the fingertip pressure exquisite as it sings,",
    "the braille of",

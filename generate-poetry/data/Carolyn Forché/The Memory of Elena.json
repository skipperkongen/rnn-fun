    "We spend our morning",
    "in the flower stalls counting",
    "the dark tongues of bells",
    "that hang from ropes waiting",
    "for the silence of an hour.",
    "We find a table, ask for",
    "cold soup and wine, where a calm",
    "light trembles years behind us.",
    "In Buenos Aires only three",
    "years ago, it was the last time his hand",
    "slipped into her dress, with pearls",
    "cooling her throat and bells like",
    "these, chipping at the night\u2014",
    "As she talks, the hollow",
    "clopping of a horse, the sound",
    "of bones touched together.",
    "The",
    "comes, a bed of rice",
    "and",
    "fingers and shells,",
    "the lips of those whose lips",
    "have been removed, mussels",
    "the soft blue of a leg socket.",
    "This is not",
    "this is what",
    "has become of those who remained",
    "in Buenos Aires. This is the ring",
    "of a rifle report on the stones,",
    "her hand over her mouth,",
    "her husband falling against her.",
    "These are the flowers we bought",
    "this morning, the dahlias tossed",
    "on his grave and bells",
    "waiting with their tongues cut out",
    "for this particular silence."

    "I take off my shirt, I show you.",
    "I shaved the hair out under my arms.",
    "I roll up my pants, I scraped off the hair",
    "on my legs with a knife, getting white.",
    "My hair is the color of chopped maples.",
    "My eyes dark as beans cooked in the south.",
    "(Coal fields in the moon on torn-up hills)",
    "Skin polished as a Ming bowl",
    "showing its blood cracks, its age, I have hundreds",
    "of names for the snow, for this, all of them quiet.",
    "In the night I come to you and it seems a shame",
    "to waste my deepest shudders on a wall of a man.",
    "You recognize strangers,",
    "think you lived through destruction.",
    "You can\u2019t explain this night, my face, your memory.",
    "You want to know what I know?",
    "Your own hands are lying."

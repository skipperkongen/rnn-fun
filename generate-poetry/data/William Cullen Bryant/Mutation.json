    "They talk of short-lived pleasure\u2013be it so\u2013",
    "Pain dies as quickly: stern, hard-featured pain",
    "Expires, and lets her weary prisoner go.",
    "The fiercest agonies have shortest reign;",
    "And after dreams of horror, comes again",
    "The welcome morning with its rays of peace.",
    "Oblivion, softly wiping out the stain,",
    "Makes the strong secret pangs of shame to cease:",
    "Remorse is virtue\u2019s root; its fair increase",
    "Are fruits of innocence and blessedness:",
    "Thus joy, o\u2019erborne and bound, doth still release",
    "His young limbs from the chains that round him press.",
    "Weep not that the world changes\u2013did it keep",
    "A stable, changeless state, \u2019twere cause indeed to weep."

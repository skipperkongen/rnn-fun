    "When beechen buds begin to swell,",
    "And woods the blue-bird\u2019s warble know,",
    "The yellow violet\u2019s modest bell",
    "Peeps from the last year\u2019s leaves below.",
    "Ere russet fields their green resume,",
    "Sweet flower, I love, in forest bare,",
    "To meet thee, when thy faint perfume",
    "Alone is in the virgin air.",
    "Of all her train, the hands of Spring",
    "First plant thee in the watery mould,",
    "And I have seen thee blossoming",
    "Beside the snow-bank\u2019s edges cold.",
    "Thy parent sun, who bade thee view",
    "Pale skies, and chilling moisture sip,",
    "Has bathed thee in his own bright hue,",
    "And streaked with jet thy glowing lip.",
    "Yet slight thy form, and low thy seat,",
    "And earthward bent thy gentle eye,",
    "Unapt the passing view to meet",
    "When loftier flowers are flaunting nigh.",
    "Oft, in the sunless April day,",
    "Thy early smile has stayed my walk;",
    "But midst the gorgeous blooms of May,",
    "I passed thee on thy humble stalk.",
    "So they, who climb to wealth, forget",
    "The friends in darker fortunes tried.",
    "I copied them\u2014but I regret",
    "That I should ape the ways of pride.",
    "And when again the genial hour",
    "Awakes the painted tribes of light,",
    "I\u2019ll not o\u2019erlook the modest flower",
    "That made the woods of April bright."

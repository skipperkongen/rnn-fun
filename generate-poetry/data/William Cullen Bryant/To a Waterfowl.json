    "Whither, 'midst falling dew,",
    "While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,",
    "Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue",
    "Thy solitary way?",
    "Vainly the fowler\u2019s eye",
    "Might mark thy distant flight, to do thee wrong,",
    "As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,",
    "Thy figure floats along.",
    "Seek\u2019st thou the plashy brink",
    "Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,",
    "Or where the rocking billows rise and sink",
    "On the chaf\u00e9d ocean side?",
    "There is a Power, whose care",
    "Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,\u2014",
    "The desert and illimitable air",
    "Lone wandering, but not lost.",
    "All day thy wings have fanned,",
    "At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere;",
    "Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,",
    "Though the dark night is near.",
    "And soon that toil shall end,",
    "Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,",
    "And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,",
    "Soon, o\u2019er thy sheltered nest.",
    "Thou\u2019rt gone, the abyss of heaven",
    "Hath swallowed up thy form, yet, on my heart",
    "Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,",
    "And shall not soon depart.",
    "He, who, from zone to zone,",
    "Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,",
    "In the long way that I must trace alone,",
    "Will lead my steps aright."

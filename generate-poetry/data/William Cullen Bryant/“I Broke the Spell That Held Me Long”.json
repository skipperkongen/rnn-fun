    "For Poetry, though heavenly born,",
    "Consorts with poverty and scorn.",

    "Could fetter me another hour.",
    "Ah, thoughtless! how could I forget",
    "Its causes were around me yet?",
    "For wheresoe\u2019er I looked, the while,",
    "Was Nature\u2019s everlasting smile.",
    "Still came and lingered on my sight",
    "Of flowers and streams the bloom and light,",
    "And glory of the stars and sun; \u2013",
    "And these and poetry are one.",
    "They, ere the world had held me long,",
    "Recalled me to the love of song."

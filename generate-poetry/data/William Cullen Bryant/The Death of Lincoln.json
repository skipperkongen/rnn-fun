    "Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,",
    "Gentle and merciful and just!",
    "Who, in the fear of God, didst bear",

    "In sorrow by thy bier we stand,",
    "Amid the awe that hushes all,",
    "And speak the anguish of a land",
    "That shook with horror at thy fall.",
    "Thy task is done; the bond are free:",
    "We bear thee to an honored grave,",
    "Whose proudest monument shall be",
    "The broken fetters of the slave.",
    "Pure was thy life; its bloody close",
    "Hath placed thee with the sons of light,",
    "Among the noble host of those",
    "Who perished in the cause of Right."

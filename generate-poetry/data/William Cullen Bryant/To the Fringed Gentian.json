    "Thou blossom bright with autumn dew,",
    "And colored with the heaven\u2019s own blue,",
    "That openest when the quiet light",
    "Succeeds the keen and frosty night.",
    "Thou comest not when violets lean",
    "O\u2019er wandering brooks and springs unseen,",
    "Or columbines, in purple dressed,",
    "Nod o\u2019er the ground-bird\u2019s hidden nest.",
    "Thou waitest late and com\u2019st alone,",
    "When woods are bare and birds are flown,",
    "And frosts and shortening days portend",
    "The aged year is near his end.",
    "Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye",
    "Look through its fringes to the sky,",
    "Blue-blue-as if that sky let fall",
    "A flower from its cerulean wall.",
    "I would that thus, when I shall see",
    "The hour of death draw near to me,",
    "Hope, blossoming within my heart,",
    "May look to heaven as I depart."

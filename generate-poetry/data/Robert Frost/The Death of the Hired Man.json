    "Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table",
    "Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,",
    "She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage",
    "To meet him in the doorway with the news",
    "And put him on his guard. \u2018Silas is back.\u2019",
    "She pushed him outward with her through the door",
    "And shut it after her. \u2018Be kind,\u2019 she said.",
    "She took the market things from Warren\u2019s arms",
    "And set them on the porch, then drew him down",
    "To sit beside her on the wooden steps.",
    "\u2018When was I ever anything but kind to him?",
    "But I\u2019ll not have the fellow back,\u2019 he said.",
    "\u2018I told him so last haying, didn\u2019t I?",
    "If he left then, I said, that ended it.",
    "What good is he? Who else will harbor him",
    "At his age for the little he can do?",
    "What help he is there\u2019s no depending on.",
    "Off he goes always when I need him most.",
    "He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,",
    "Enough at least to buy tobacco with,",
    "So he won\u2019t have to beg and be beholden.",
    "\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to pay",
    "Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.\u201d",
    "\u201cSomeone else can.\u201d \u201cThen someone else will have to.\u201d",
    "I shouldn\u2019t mind his bettering himself",
    "If that was what it was. You can be certain,",
    "When he begins like that, there\u2019s someone at him",
    "Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,\u2014",
    "In haying time, when any help is scarce.",
    "In winter he comes back to us. I\u2019m done.\u2019",
    "\u2018Sh! not so loud: he\u2019ll hear you,\u2019 Mary said.",
    "\u2018I want him to: he\u2019ll have to soon or late.\u2019",
    "\u2018He\u2019s worn out. He\u2019s asleep beside the stove.",
    "When I came up from Rowe\u2019s I found him here,",
    "Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,",
    "A miserable sight, and frightening, too\u2014",
    "You needn\u2019t smile\u2014I didn\u2019t recognize him\u2014",
    "I wasn\u2019t looking for him\u2014and he\u2019s changed.",
    "Wait till you see.\u2019",
    "\u2018Where did you say he\u2019d been?\u2019",
    "\u2018He didn\u2019t say. I dragged him to the house,",
    "And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.",
    "I tried to make him talk about his travels.",
    "Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.\u2019",
    "\u2018What did he say? Did he say anything?\u2019",
    "\u2018But little.\u2019",
    "\u2018Anything? Mary, confess",
    "He said he\u2019d come to ditch the meadow for me.\u2019",
    "\u2018Warren!\u2019",
    "\u2018But did he? I just want to know.\u2019",
    "\u2018Of course he did. What would you have him say?",
    "Surely you wouldn\u2019t grudge the poor old man",
    "Some humble way to save his self-respect.",
    "He added, if you really care to know,",
    "He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.",
    "That sounds like something you have heard before?",
    "Warren, I wish you could have heard the way",
    "He jumbled everything. I stopped to look",
    "Two or three times\u2014he made me feel so queer\u2014",
    "To see if he was talking in his sleep.",
    "He ran on Harold Wilson\u2014you remember\u2014",
    "The boy you had in haying four years since.",
    "He\u2019s finished school, and teaching in his college.",
    "Silas declares you\u2019ll have to get him back.",
    "He says they two will make a team for work:",
    "Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!",
    "The way he mixed that in with other things.",
    "He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft",
    "On education\u2014you know how they fought",
    "All through July under the blazing sun,",
    "Silas up on the cart to build the load,",
    "Harold along beside to pitch it on.\u2019",
    "\u2018Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.",
    "You wouldn\u2019t think they would. How some things linger!",
    "Harold\u2019s young college boy\u2019s assurance piqued him.",
    "After so many years he still keeps finding",
    "Good arguments he sees he might have used.",
    "I sympathize. I know just how it feels",
    "To think of the right thing to say too late.",
    "Harold\u2019s associated in his mind with Latin.",
    "He asked me what I thought of Harold\u2019s saying",
    "He studied Latin like the violin",
    "Because he liked it\u2014that an argument!",
    "He said he couldn\u2019t make the boy believe",
    "He could find water with a hazel prong\u2014",
    "Which showed how much good school had ever done him.",
    "He wanted to go over that. But most of all",
    "He thinks if he could have another chance",
    "To teach him how to build a load of hay\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018I know, that\u2019s Silas\u2019 one accomplishment.",
    "He bundles every forkful in its place,",
    "And tags and numbers it for future reference,",
    "So he can find and easily dislodge it",
    "In the unloading. Silas does that well.",
    "He takes it out in bunches like big birds\u2019 nests.",
    "You never see him standing on the hay",
    "He\u2019s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.\u2019",
    "\u2018He thinks if he could teach him that, he\u2019d be",
    "Some good perhaps to someone in the world.",
    "He hates to see a boy the fool of books.",
    "Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,",
    "And nothing to look backward to with pride,",
    "And nothing to look forward to with hope,",
    "So now and never any different.\u2019",
    "Part of a moon was falling down the west,",
    "Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.",
    "Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw it",
    "And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand",
    "Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,",
    "Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,",
    "As if she played unheard some tenderness",
    "That wrought on him beside her in the night.",
    "\u2018Warren,\u2019 she said, \u2018he has come home to die:",
    "You needn\u2019t be afraid he\u2019ll leave you this time.\u2019",
    "\u2018Home,\u2019 he mocked gently.",
    "\u2018Yes, what else but home?",
    "It all depends on what you mean by home.",
    "Of course he\u2019s nothing to us, any more",
    "Than was the hound that came a stranger to us",
    "Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.\u2019",
    "\u2018Home is the place where, when you have to go there,",
    "They have to take you in.\u2019",
    "\u2018I should have called it",
    "Something you somehow haven\u2019t to deserve.\u2019",
    "Warren leaned out and took a step or two,",
    "Picked up a little stick, and brought it back",
    "And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.",
    "\u2018Silas has better claim on us you think",
    "Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles",
    "As the road winds would bring him to his door.",
    "Silas has walked that far no doubt today.",
    "Why didn\u2019t he go there? His brother\u2019s rich,",
    "A somebody\u2014director in the bank.\u2019",
    "\u2018He never told us that.\u2019",
    "\u2018We know it though.\u2019",
    "\u2018I think his brother ought to help, of course.",
    "I\u2019ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right",
    "To take him in, and might be willing to\u2014",
    "He may be better than appearances.",
    "But have some pity on Silas. Do you think",
    "If he\u2019d had any pride in claiming kin",
    "Or anything he looked for from his brother,",
    "He\u2019d keep so still about him all this time?\u2019",
    "\u2018I wonder what\u2019s between them.\u2019",
    "\u2018I can tell you.",
    "Silas is what he is\u2014we wouldn\u2019t mind him\u2014",
    "But just the kind that kinsfolk can\u2019t abide.",
    "He never did a thing so very bad.",
    "He don\u2019t know why he isn\u2019t quite as good",
    "As anyone. Worthless though he is,",
    "He won\u2019t be made ashamed to please his brother.\u2019",
    "\u2018",
    "can\u2019t think Si ever hurt anyone.\u2019",
    "\u2018No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay",
    "And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.",
    "He wouldn\u2019t let me put him on the lounge.",
    "You must go in and see what you can do.",
    "I made the bed up for him there tonight.",
    "You\u2019ll be surprised at him\u2014how much he\u2019s broken.",
    "His working days are done; I'm sure of it.\u2019",
    "\u2018I\u2019d not be in a hurry to say that.\u2019",
    "\u2018I haven\u2019t been. Go, look, see for yourself.",
    "But, Warren, please remember how it is:",
    "He\u2019s come to help you ditch the meadow.",
    "He has a plan. You mustn\u2019t laugh at him.",
    "He may not speak of it, and then he may.",
    "I\u2019ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud",
    "Will hit or miss the moon.\u2019",
    "It hit the moon.",
    "Then there were three there, making a dim row,",
    "The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.",
    "Warren returned\u2014too soon, it seemed to her,",
    "Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.",
    "\u2018Warren,\u2019 she questioned.",
    "\u2018Dead,\u2019 was all he answered."

    "Whose woods these are I think I know.",
    "His house is in the village though;",
    "He will not see me stopping here",
    "To watch his woods fill up with snow.",
    "My little horse must think it queer",
    "To stop without a farmhouse near",
    "Between the woods and frozen lake",
    "The darkest evening of the year.",
    "He gives his harness bells a shake",
    "To ask if there is some mistake.",
    "The only other sound\u2019s the sweep",
    "Of easy wind and downy flake.",
    "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,",
    "But I have promises to keep,",
    "And miles to go before I sleep,",
    "And miles to go before I sleep."

    "He saw her from the bottom of the stairs",
    "Before she saw him. She was starting down,",
    "Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.",
    "She took a doubtful step and then undid it",
    "To raise herself and look again. He spoke",
    "Advancing toward her: \u2018What is it you see",
    "From up there always\u2014for I want to know.\u2019",
    "She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,",
    "And her face changed from terrified to dull.",
    "He said to gain time: \u2018What is it you see,\u2019",
    "Mounting until she cowered under him.",
    "\u2018I will find out now\u2014you must tell me, dear.\u2019",
    "She, in her place, refused him any help",
    "With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.",
    "She let him look, sure that he wouldn\u2019t see,",
    "Blind creature; and awhile he didn\u2019t see.",
    "But at last he murmured, \u2018Oh,\u2019 and again, \u2018Oh.\u2019",
    "\u2018What is it\u2014what?\u2019 she said.",
    "\u2018Just that I see.\u2019",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t,\u2019 she challenged. \u2018Tell me what it is.\u2019",
    "\u2018The wonder is I didn\u2019t see at once.",
    "I never noticed it from here before.",
    "I must be wonted to it\u2014that\u2019s the reason.",
    "The little graveyard where my people are!",
    "So small the window frames the whole of it.",
    "Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?",
    "There are three stones of slate and one of marble,",
    "Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight",
    "On the sidehill. We haven\u2019t to mind",
    ".",
    "But I understand: it is not the stones,",
    "But the child\u2019s mound\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t,\u2019 she cried.",
    "She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm",
    "That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;",
    "And turned on him with such a daunting look,",
    "He said twice over before he knew himself:",
    "\u2018Can\u2019t a man speak of his own child he\u2019s lost?\u2019",
    "\u2018Not you! Oh, where\u2019s my hat? Oh, I don\u2019t need it!",
    "I must get out of here. I must get air.",
    "I don\u2019t know rightly whether any man can.\u2019",
    "\u2018Amy! Don\u2019t go to someone else this time.",
    "Listen to me. I won\u2019t come down the stairs.\u2019",
    "He sat and fixed his chin between his fists.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s something I should like to ask you, dear.\u2019",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t know how to ask it.\u2019",
    "\u2018Help me, then.\u2019",
    "Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.",
    "\u2018My words are nearly always an offense.",
    "I don\u2019t know how to speak of anything",
    "So as to please you. But I might be taught",
    "I should suppose. I can\u2019t say I see how.",
    "A man must partly give up being a man",
    "With women-folk. We could have some arrangement",
    "By which I\u2019d bind myself to keep hands off",
    "Anything special you\u2019re a-mind to name.",
    "Though I don\u2019t like such things \u2019twixt those that love.",
    "Two that don\u2019t love can\u2019t live together without them.",
    "But two that do can\u2019t live together with them.\u2019",
    "She moved the latch a little. \u2018Don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t go.",
    "Don\u2019t carry it to someone else this time.",
    "Tell me about it if it\u2019s something human.",
    "Let me into your grief. I\u2019m not so much",
    "Unlike other folks as your standing there",
    "Apart would make me out. Give me my chance.",
    "I do think, though, you overdo it a little.",
    "What was it brought you up to think it the thing",
    "To take your mother-loss of a first child",
    "So inconsolably\u2014in the face of love.",
    "You\u2019d think his memory might be satisfied\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018There you go sneering now!\u2019",
    "\u2018I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not!",
    "You make me angry. I\u2019ll come down to you.",
    "God, what a woman! And it\u2019s come to this,",
    "A man can\u2019t speak of his own child that\u2019s dead.\u2019",
    "\u2018You can\u2019t because you don't know how to speak.",
    "If you had any feelings, you that dug",
    "With your own hand\u2014how could you?\u2014his little grave;",
    "I saw you from that very window there,",
    "Making the gravel leap and leap in air,",
    "Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly",
    "And roll back down the mound beside the hole.",
    "I thought, Who is that man? I didn\u2019t know you.",
    "And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs",
    "To look again, and still your spade kept lifting.",
    "Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice",
    "Out in the kitchen, and I don\u2019t know why,",
    "But I went near to see with my own eyes.",
    "You could sit there with the stains on your shoes",
    "Of the fresh earth from your own baby\u2019s grave",
    "And talk about your everyday concerns.",
    "You had stood the spade up against the wall",
    "Outside there in the entry, for I saw it.\u2019",
    "\u2018I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.",
    "I\u2019m cursed. God, if I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m cursed.\u2019",
    "\u2018I can repeat the very words you were saying:",
    "\u201cThree foggy mornings and one rainy day",
    "Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.\u201d",
    "Think of it, talk like that at such a time!",
    "What had how long it takes a birch to rot",
    "To do with what was in the darkened parlor?",
    "You",
    "care! The nearest friends can go",
    "With anyone to death, comes so far short",
    "They might as well not try to go at all.",
    "No, from the time when one is sick to death,",
    "One is alone, and he dies more alone.",
    "Friends make pretense of following to the grave,",
    "But before one is in it, their minds are turned",
    "And making the best of their way back to life",
    "And living people, and things they understand.",
    "But the world\u2019s evil. I won\u2019t have grief so",
    "If I can change it. Oh, I won\u2019t, I won\u2019t!\u2019",
    "\u2018There, you have said it all and you feel better.",
    "You won\u2019t go now. You\u2019re crying. Close the door.",
    "The heart\u2019s gone out of it: why keep it up.",
    "Amy! There\u2019s someone coming down the road!\u2019",
    "\u2018",
    "\u2014oh, you think the talk is all. I must go\u2014",
    "Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018If\u2014you\u2014do!\u2019 She was opening the door wider.",
    "\u2018Where do you mean to go? First tell me that.",

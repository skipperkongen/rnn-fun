    "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,",
    "And sorry I could not travel both",
    "And be one traveler, long I stood",
    "And looked down one as far as I could",
    "To where it bent in the undergrowth;",
    "Then took the other, as just as fair,",
    "And having perhaps the better claim,",
    "Because it was grassy and wanted wear;",
    "Though as for that the passing there",
    "Had worn them really about the same,",
    "And both that morning equally lay",
    "In leaves no step had trodden black.",
    "Oh, I kept the first for another day!",
    "Yet knowing how way leads on to way,",
    "I doubted if I should ever come back.",
    "I shall be telling this with a sigh",
    "Somewhere ages and ages hence:",
    "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014",
    "I took the one less traveled by,",
    "And that has made all the difference."

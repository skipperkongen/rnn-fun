    "Incurable and unbelieving",
    "in any truth but the truth of grieving,",
    "I saw a tree inside a tree",
    "rise kaleidoscopically",
    "as if the leaves had livelier ghosts.",
    "I pressed my face as close",
    "to the pane as I could get",
    "to watch that fitful, fluent spirit",
    "that seemed a single being undefined",
    "or countless beings of one mind",
    "haul its strange cohesion",
    "beyond the limits of my vision",
    "over the house heavenwards.",
    "Of course I knew those leaves were birds.",
    "Of course that old tree stood",
    "exactly as it had and would",
    "(but why should it seem fuller now?)",
    "and though a man's mind might endow",
    "even a tree with some excess",
    "of life to which a man seems witness,",
    "that life is not the life of men.",
    "And that is where the joy came in."

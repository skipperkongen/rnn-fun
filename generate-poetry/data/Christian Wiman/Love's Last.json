    "Love's last urgency is earth",
    "and grief is all gravity",
    "and the long fall always",
    "back to earliest hours",
    "that exist nowhere",
    "but in one's brain.",
    "From the hard-packed",
    "pile of old-mown grass,",
    "from boredom, from pain,",
    "a boy's random slash",
    "unlocks a dark ardor",
    "of angry bees",
    "that link the trees",
    "and block his way home.",
    "I like to hold him holding me,",
    "mystery mastering fear,",
    "so young, standing unstung",
    "under what survives of sky.",
    "I learned too late how to live.",
    "Child, teach me how to die."

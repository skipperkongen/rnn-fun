    "A town so flat a grave's a hill,",
    "A dusk the color of beer.",
    "A row of schooldesks shadows fill,",
    "A row of houses near.",
    "A courthouse spreading to its lawn,",
    "A bank clock's lingering heat.",
    "A gleam of storefronts not quite gone,",
    "A courthouse in the street.",
    "A different element, almost,",
    "A dry creek brimming black.",
    "A light to lure the darkness close,",
    "A light to keep it back.",
    "A time so still a heart's a sound,",
    "A moon the color of skin.",
    "A pumpjack bowing to the ground,",
    "Again, again, again."

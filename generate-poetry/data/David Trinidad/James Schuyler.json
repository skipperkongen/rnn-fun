    "I went to his sixty-sixth birthday",
    "dinner: sixteen years ago this past",
    "November. I remember that it was at",
    "Chelsea Central (his favorite restaurant:",
    "great steaks) on 10th Avenue, and",
    "that Ashbery was there, and a few",
    "others, including Joe, impeccably",
    "dressed and gracious, who picked up",
    "what must have been (I thought",
    "at the time) an exorbitant bill.",
    "I remember him saying more than",
    "once, \u201cJoe always picks up the bill,\u201d",
    "then smiling a slightly wicked smile.",
    "Sitting with him (those excruciating",
    "silences!) in his room at the Chelsea,",
    "my eyes would wander from his book-",
    "shelves (",
    "stood out)",
    "to the pan of water on the radiator",
    "to the records strewn on the floor",
    "to some scraggly plants (ivy? herbs?)",
    "in ceramic pots at the base of the French",
    "doors that opened to the balcony and",
    "balustrade and sound of traffic on 23rd",
    "Street six floors below. He read me",
    "\u201cWhite Boat, Blue Boat\u201d shortly after he",
    "wrote it, and a poem about Brook Benton",
    "singing \u201cRainy Night in Georgia\u201d that",
    "didn\u2019t make it into his",
    ", though",
    "I remember thinking it beautiful. He",
    "complained, in a letter to Tom, about",
    "how much I smoked, and how emotional",
    "I\u2019d get during movies: he must have been",
    "referring to",
    "(he had a yen",

    "hadn\u2019t ridden it in years) to the Frick;",
    "I remember admiring Romney\u2019s Lady",
    "Hamilton. It hurt that he didn\u2019t invite",

    "or to the reception after his reading at the",

    "read \u201cMood Indigo,\u201d dedicated to me.",
    "When he said my name from the stage,",
    "Joan and Eileen, sitting to my left, turned",

    "When he came to a reading I gave at",
    "St. Mark\u2019s, Raymond impressed upon",
    "me what an honor it was: Jimmy didn\u2019t",
    "go to many poetry readings. What else",
    "is there to say? That when I visited him",
    "at St. Vincent\u2019s the day before he died",
    "Darragh said, \u201cHe likes to hear gossip.\u201d",
    "So I said, \u201cEileen and I are talking again.\u201d",
    "That at his funeral I sat alone (Ira couldn\u2019t",
    "come); that that was the loneliest feeling",
    "in the world. That afterwards Doug said",
    "\u201cYou look so sad.\u201d How should I have",
    "looked, Doug! And that a year after he",
    "died, I dreamt I saw him in the lobby of",

    "faces.\u201d I approached him, but he",
    "disappeared."

    "Fair season and we\u2019re tent pitching",
    "on holy grounds in central Illinois,",
    "busting through pavement with jack hammers,",
    "driving home a stake that will be pulled two months",
    "from now. One of us holds, the other presses",
    "down, grease shooting between cracks",
    "in the old hammer\u2019s worn shell",
    "to our hands and faces\u2014one slip and we\u2019ve",
    "lost our toes. I\u2019m from the warehouse,",
    "not the tent crew. I haven\u2019t ridden around",
    "in tent haulers across the nation",
    "popping tents here and there, but for this,",
    "the state fair, the warehousers are let out",
    "to feel important. Around us a silvered city",
    "has risen, white vinyl tents at full mast",
    "and clean for the first time in a year. It\u2019s August.",
    "It\u2019s the summer\u2019s dogged days when humidity",
    "doesn\u2019t break until midnight, an hour after",
    "the fair\u2019s closed down. We\u2019re piled on back",
    "of a flatbed with our tools, our tiredness.",
    "We\u2019re a monster understood best",
    "by Midwesterners, devouring parking lots",
    "and fields, our teeth stained by cigarette",
    "and chew, some of us not old enough, some",
    "too old. All of us here for the overtime."

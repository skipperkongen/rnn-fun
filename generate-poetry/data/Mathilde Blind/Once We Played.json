    "Once we played at love together\u2014",
    "Played it smartly, if you please;",
    "Lightly, as a windblown feather,",
    "Did we stake a heart apiece.",
    "Oh, it was delicious fooling!",
    "In the hottest of the game,",
    "Without thought of future cooling,",
    "All too quickly burned Life\u2019s flame.",
    "In this give-and-take of glances,",
    "Kisses sweet as honey dews,",
    "When we played with equal chances,",
    "Did you win, or did I lose?"

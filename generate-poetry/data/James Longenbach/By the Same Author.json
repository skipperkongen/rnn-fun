    "Today, no matter if it rains,",
    "It\u2019s time to follow the path into the forest.",
    "The same people will be walking the same dogs,",
    "Or if not the same dogs, dogs that behave in similar fashions,",
    "Some barking, some standing aloof.",
    "The owners carry plastic bags.",
    "But this is the forest, they complain, we must do as we like.",
    "We must let the dogs run free,",
    "We must follow their example,",
    "The way we did when we were young.",
    "Back then we slept, watched",
    "\u2014",
    "We were the dogs.",
    "By the time the screen door slammed, we were gone.",
    "Nobody really talks like that in the forest.",
    "They\u2019re proud of their dogs,",
    "Proud especially of the ones who never bark.",
    "They\u2019re upset about the Norway maple, it\u2019s everywhere,",
    "Crowding out the hickories and oaks.",
    "Did you know it takes a million seeds to make one tree?",
    "Your chances of surviving in the forest,",
    "Of replicating yourself, are slim.",
    "Today, the smaller dogs are wearing raincoats,",
    "The bigger ones are stiffing it out.",
    "They\u2019re tense, preoccupied,",
    "Running in circles,",
    "Getting tangled in the leash\u2014",
    "It\u2019s hard remaining human in the forest.",
    "To move the limbs of the body,",
    "To speak intelligible words,",
    "These things promise change."

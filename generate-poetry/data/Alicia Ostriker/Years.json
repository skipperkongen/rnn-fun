    "I have wished you dead and myself dead,",
    "How could it be otherwise.",
    "I have broken into you like a burglar",
    "And you've set your dogs on me.",
    "You have been a hurricane to me",
    "And a pile of broken sticks",
    "A child could kick.",
    "I have climbed you like a monument, gasping,",
    "For the exercise and the view,",
    "And leaned over the railing at the top\u2013",
    "Strong and warm, that summer wind."

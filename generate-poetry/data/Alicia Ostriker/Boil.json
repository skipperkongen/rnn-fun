    "Boil over\u2014it\u2019s what the nerves do,",
    "Watch them seethe when stimulated,",
    "Murmurs the man at the stove",
    "To the one at the fridge\u2014",
    "Watch that electric impulse that finally makes them",
    "Fume and fizz at either",
    "Frayed end. If you could grasp a bundle",
    "Of nerves in your fist like a jumper cable, and sense that",
    "Python\u2019s writhe, or a garden hose when the pressure\u2019s",
    "High and it wilfully weaves about",
    "Trying its best to get away from you\u2014",
    "You\u2019d see how nothing is passive,",
    "We\u2019re all\u2014I mean from our elephant sun, ejaculant",
    "Great-grandfather, cascading down",
    "To weightless",
    "Unstoppable neutrinos",
    "Leaving their silvery trace",
    "In vacuum chambers, in",
    "Effervescent lines, twisted",
    "Madly in our madhouse jackets,",

    "Though to rupture them might be of course to die,",
    "Or,",
    ",",
    "To change:",
    "Boil, it\u2019s what water",
    "And everything else teaches."

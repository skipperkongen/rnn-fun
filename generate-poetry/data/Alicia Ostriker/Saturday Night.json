    "And here it comes: around the world,",
    "In Chicago, Petersburg, Tokyo, the dancers",
    "Hit the floor running (the communal dancefloor",
    "Here, there, at intervals, sometimes paved,",
    "Sometimes rotted linoleum awash in beer,",
    "Sometimes a field across which the dancers streak",
    "Like violets across grass, sometimes packed dirt",
    "In a township of corrugated metal roofs)",
    "And what was once prescribed ritual, the profuse",
    "Strains of premeditated art, is now improvisation,",
    "The desperately new, where to the sine-curved",
    "Yelps and spasms of police sirens outside",
    "The club, a spasmodic feedback ululates",
    "The death and cremation of history,",
    "Until a boy whose hair is purple spikes,",
    "And a girl wearing a skull",
    "That wants to say",
    ",",
    "Get up and dance together, sort of, age thirteen.",
    "Young allegorists, they\u2019ll mime motions",
    "Of shootouts, of tortured ones in basements,",
    "Of cold insinuations before sex",
    "Between enemies, the jubilance of the criminal.",
    "The girl tosses her head and dances",
    "The shoplifter\u2019s meanness and self-betrayal",
    "For a pair of stockings, a scarf, a perfume,",
    "The boy dances stealing the truck,",
    "Shooting his father.",
    "The point is to become a flying viper,",
    "A diving vulva, the great point",
    "Is experiment, like pollen flinging itself",
    "Into far other habitats, or seed",
    "That travels a migrant bird\u2019s gut",
    "To be shit overseas.",
    "The creatures gamble on the whirl of life",
    "And every adolescent body hot",
    "Enough to sweat it out on the dance floor",
    "Is a laboratory: maybe this lipstick, these boots,",
    "These jeans, these earrings, maybe if I flip",
    "My hair and vibrate my pelvis",
    "Exactly synched to the band\u2019s wildfire noise",
    "That imitates history\u2019s catastrophe",
    "Nuke for nuke, maybe I\u2019ll survive,",
    "Maybe we\u2019ll all survive. . . .",
    "At the intersection of poverty and plague",
    "The planet's children\u2014brave, uncontrollable, juiced",
    "Out of their gourds\u2014invent the sacred dance."

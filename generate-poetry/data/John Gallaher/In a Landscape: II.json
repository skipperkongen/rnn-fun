    "\u201cGhosts are people who think they\u2019re ghosts,\u201d",
    "my daughter Natalie said, starting off the period",
    "we will refer to later as A Little Bit Further Along. Since then",
    "(which was last night, November 3rd, 2009), I\u2019ve been thinking",
    "about where I am more, as a kind of goal,",
    "and somewhat less about where I\u2019m not. It\u2019s a pleasure to be",
    "where one is, given that someone",
    "isn\u2019t somewhere lethal. This is Pleasure One.",
    "And now this is Pleasure Two, thinking about it,",
    "so that this place, which was Place One, and a pleasure,",
    "as we were there where we were and it was not a lethal place,",
    "but a place where we were, is now this place again",
    "as we\u2019re here thinking about it, like America or a popsicle.",
    "\u201cOpen the house and the house is empty,\u201d Natalie also said, meaning",
    "her dollhouse, as she\u2019s seven, but when she said it, I had this",
    "vision of all of us suddenly disappearing, maybe thinking",
    "ourselves ghosts, even, or getting somewhere, out",
    "and around her bedroom and then down the hall and stairs.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you how it happened. Natalie and I were looking out the window",
    "at the backyard, and she asked me if I liked our house. It\u2019s a theme",
    "with her. The other night she asked me if I liked life. I said, \u201cYeah,",
    "a lot.\u201d And she looked at me a second and then said, \u201cMe too.\u201d",
    "You don\u2019t hear that every day, I think, until the accumulations",
    "begin to remind me of every day: Carla, who donated a kidney",
    "to her brother-in-law (Robin\u2019s uncle), has just been diagnosed",
    "with cancer, two months later. She sends hopeful updates",
    "from the hospital, on Facebook. Like fountains, the footnotes",
    "go on. My footnote or yours. The big questions can\u2019t be decided",
    "in this way. They demand coins or laws. And this is",
    "much too important to be a big question."

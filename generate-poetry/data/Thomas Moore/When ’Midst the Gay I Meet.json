    "When \u2019midst the gay I meet",
    "That gentle smile of thine,",
    "Though still on me it turns most sweet,",
    "I scarce can call it mine:",
    "But when to me alone",
    "Your secret tears you show,",
    "Oh, then I feel those tears my own,",
    "And claim them while they flow.",
    "Then still with bright looks bless",
    "The gay, the cold, the free;",
    "Give smiles to those who love you less,",
    "But keep your tears for me.",
    "The snow on Jura\u2019s steep",
    "Can smile in many a beam,",
    "Yet still in chains of coldness sleep,",
    "How bright soe\u2019er it seem.",
    "But, when some deep-felt ray,",
    "Whose touch is fire, appears,",
    "Oh, then the smile is warm\u2019d away,",
    "And, melting, turns to tears.",
    "Then still with bright looks bless",
    "The gay, the cold, the free;",
    "Give smiles to those who love you less,",
    "But keep your tears for me."

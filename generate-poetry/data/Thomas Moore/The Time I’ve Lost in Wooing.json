    "The time I\u2019ve lost in wooing,",
    "In watching and pursuing",
    "The light, that lies",
    "In woman\u2019s eyes,",
    "Has been my heart\u2019s undoing.",
    "Though Wisdom oft has sought me,",
    "I scorn\u2019d the lore she brought me,",
    "My only books",
    "Were woman\u2019s looks,",
    "And folly\u2019s all they\u2019ve taught me.",
    "Her smile when Beauty granted,",
    "I hung with gaze enchanted,",
    "Like him the Sprite,",
    "Whom maids by night",
    "Oft meet in glen that\u2019s haunted.",
    "Like him, too, Beauty won me,",
    "But while her eyes were on me,",
    "If once their ray",
    "Was turn\u2019d away,",
    "Oh! winds could not outrun me.",
    "And are those follies going?",
    "And is my proud heart growing",
    "Too cold or wise",
    "For brilliant eyes",
    "Again to set it glowing?",
    "No, vain, alas! th\u2019 endeavour",
    "From bonds so sweet to sever;",
    "Poor Wisdom\u2019s chance",
    "Against a glance",
    "Is now as weak as ever."

    "Oft, in the stilly night,",
    "Ere slumber\u2019s chain has bound me,",
    "Fond memory brings the light",
    "Of other days around me;",
    "The smiles, the tears,",
    "Of boyhood\u2019s years,",
    "The words of love then spoken;",
    "The eyes that shone,",
    "Now dimm\u2019d and gone,",
    "The cheerful hearts now broken!",
    "Thus, in the stilly night,",
    "Ere slumber\u2019s chain hath bound me,",
    "Sad memory brings the light",
    "Of other days around me.",
    "When I remember all",
    "The friends, so link\u2019d together,",
    "I\u2019ve seen around me fall,",
    "Like leaves in wintry weather;",
    "I feel like one",
    "Who treads alone",
    "Some banquet-hall deserted,",
    "Whose lights are fled,",
    "Whose garlands dead,",
    "And all but he departed!",
    "Thus, in the stilly night,",
    "Ere slumber\u2019s chain has bound me,",
    "Sad memory brings the light",
    "Of other days around me."

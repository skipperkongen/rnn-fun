    "\u201cHow sweetly,\u201d said the trembling maid,",
    "Of her own gentle voice afraid,",
    "So long had they in silence stood,",
    "Looking upon that tranquil flood\u2014",
    "\u201cHow sweetly does the moon-beam smile",
    "To-night upon yon leafy isle!",
    "Oft in my fancy\u2019s wanderings,",
    "I\u2019ve wish\u2019d that little isle had wings,",
    "And we, within its fairy bow\u2019rs,",
    "Were wafted off to seas unknown,",
    "Where not a pulse should beat but ours,",
    "And we might live, love, die alone!",
    "Far from the cruel and the cold,\u2014",
    "Where the bright eyes of angels only",
    "Should come around us, to behold",
    "A paradise so pure and lonely.",
    "Would this be world enough for thee?\u201d\u2014",
    "Playful she turn\u2019d, that he might see",
    "The passing smile her cheek put on;",
    "But when she mark\u2019d how mournfully",
    "His eyes met hers, that smile was gone;",
    "And, bursting into heart-felt tears,",
    "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she cried, \u201cmy hourly fears",
    "My dreams have boded all too right\u2014",
    "We part\u2014for ever part\u2014to-night!",
    "I knew, I knew it",
    "not last\u2014",
    "\u2019Twas bright, \u2019twas heav\u2019nly, but \u2019tis past!",
    "Oh! ever thus, from childhood\u2019s hour,",
    "I\u2019ve seen my fondest hopes decay;",
    "I never lov\u2019d a tree or flow\u2019r,",
    "But \u2019twas the first to fade away.",
    "I never nurs\u2019d a dear gazelle",
    "To glad me with its soft black eye,",
    "But when it came to know me well",
    "And love me, it was sure to die!",
    "Now too\u2014the joy most like divine",
    "Of all I ever dreamt or knew,",
    "To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,\u2014",
    "Oh misery! must I lose",
    "too?",
    "Yet go\u2014on peril\u2019s brink we meet;\u2014",
    "Those frightful rocks\u2014that treach\u2019rous sea\u2014",
    "No, never come again\u2014though sweet,",
    "Though heav\u2019n, it may be death to thee.",
    "Farewell\u2014and blessings on thy way,",
    "Where\u2019er thou goest, beloved stranger!",
    "Better to sit and watch that ray,",
    "And think thee safe, though far away,",
    "Than have thee near me, and in danger!\u201d"

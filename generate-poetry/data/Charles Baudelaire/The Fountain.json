    "Thus your soul ignited",
    "By pleasure\u2019s lusts and needs",
    "Sprays into heaven\u2019s reaches",
    "And dreams of fiery deeds.",
    "Then it brims over, dying,",

    "O you, whom night enhances,",
    "How sweet here at your breasts",
    "To hear the eternal sadness",
    "Of water that never rests.",
    "O moon, o singing fountain,",
    "O leaf-thronged night above,",
    "You are the faultless mirrors",
    "Of my sweet, bitter love.",

    "The fountain wears",
    "Where Phoebe\u2019s very own",
    "Color appears",
    "Falls like a summer rain",

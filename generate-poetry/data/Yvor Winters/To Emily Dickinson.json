    "Dear Emily, my tears would burn your page,",
    "But for the fire-dry line that makes them burn\u2014",
    "Burning my eyes, my fingers, while I turn",
    "Singly the words that crease my heart with age.",
    "If I could make some tortured pilgrimage",
    "Through words or Time or the blank pain of Doom",
    "And kneel before you as you found your tomb,",
    "Then I might rise to face my heritage.",
    "Yours was an empty upland solitude",
    "Bleached to the powder of a dying name;",
    "The mind, lost in a word\u2019s lost certitude",
    "That faded as the fading footsteps came",
    "To trace an epilogue to words grown odd",
    "In that hard argument which led to God."

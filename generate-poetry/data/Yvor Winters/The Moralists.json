    "You would extend the mind beyond the act,",
    "Furious, bending, suffering in thin",
    "And unpoetic dicta; you have been",
    "Forced by hypothesis to fiercer fact.",
    "As metal singing hard, with firmness racked,",
    "You formulate our passion; and behind",
    "In some harsh moment nowise of the mind",
    "Lie the old meanings your advance has packed.",
    "No man can hold existence in the head.",
    "I, too, have known the anguish of the right",
    "Amid this net of mathematic dearth,",
    "And the brain throbbing like a ship at night:",
    "Have faced with old unmitigated dread",
    "The hard familiar wrinkles of the earth."

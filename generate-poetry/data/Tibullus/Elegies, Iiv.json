    "Yield prompt compliance to the maid\u2019s desires;",
    "A prompt compliance fans the lover\u2019s fires:",
    "Go pleas\u2019d where\u2019er she goes, tho\u2019 long the way,",
    "Tho\u2019 the fierce Dog-star dart his sultry ray;",
    "Tho\u2019 painted Iris gird the bluish sky,",
    "And sure portends, that rattling storms are nigh:",
    "Or, if the fair one pant for sylvan fame,",
    "Gay drag the meshes, and provoke the game:",
    "Nay, should she choose to risk the driving gale;",
    "Or steer, or row, or agile hand the sail:",
    "No toil, tho\u2019 weak, tho\u2019 fearful, thou forbear;",
    "No toils should tire you, and no dangers scare:",
    "Occasion smiles, then snatch an ardent kiss;",
    "The coy may struggle, but will grant the bliss:",
    "The bliss obtain\u2019d, the fictious struggle past,",
    "Unbid, they\u2019ll clasp you in their arms at last."

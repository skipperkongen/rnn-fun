    "Far from the tender Tribe of Boys remove,",
    "For they\u2019ve a thousand ways to kindle Love.",
    "This, pleases as he strides the manag\u2019d Horse,",
    "And holds the taughten\u2019d Rein with early Force;",
    "This, as he swims, delights thy Fancy best,",
    "Raising the smiling Wave with snowy Breast:",
    "This, with a comely Look and manly Airs;",
    "And that with Virgin Modesty ensnares.",
    "But if at first you find him not inclin\u2019d",
    "To Love, have Patience, Time will change his Mind.",
    "*",
    "And you, what\u2019er your Fav\u2019rite does, approve,",
    "For Condescension leads the Way to love.",
    "Go with him where he goes, tho\u2019 long the Way,",
    "And the fierce Dog-star fires the sultry Day;",
    "Or the gay Rainbow girds the bluish Sky,",
    "And threatens rattling Show\u2019rs of Rain are nigh.",
    "If sailing on the Water by his Will,",
    "Then steer the Wherry with a dext\u2019rous Skill:",
    "Nor think it hard Fatigues and Pains to bear,",
    "But still be ready with a willing Cheer.",
    "If he\u2019ll inclose the Vales for savage Spoils,",
    "Then on thy Shoulders bear the Nets and Toils;",
    "If Fencing be the Fav\u2019rite Sport he\u2019ll use,",
    "Take up the Files, and artlessly oppose;",
    "Seem as intent, yet oft expose your Breast,",
    "Neglect your Guard, and let him get the best;",
    "Then he\u2019ll be mild, then you a Kiss may seize,",
    "He\u2019ll struggle, but at length comply with ease;",
    "Reluctant, tho\u2019 at first you\u2019ll find him grow",
    "Ev\u2019n fond, when round your Neck his Arms he\u2019ll throw."

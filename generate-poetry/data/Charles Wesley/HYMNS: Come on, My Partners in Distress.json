    "Come on, my partners in distress,",
    "My comrades through the wilderness,",
    "Who still your bodies feel;",
    "Awhile forget your griefs and fears,",
    "And look beyond this vale of tears",
    "To that celestial hill.",
    "2",
    "Beyond the bounds of time and space",
    "Look forward to that heavenly place,",
    "The saints\u2019 secure abode;",
    "On faith\u2019s strong eagle pinions rise,",
    "And force your passage to the skies,",
    "And scale the mount of God.",
    "3",
    "Who suffer with our Master here,",
    "We shall before his face appear,",
    "And by his side sit down;",
    "To patient faith the prize is sure,",
    "And all that to the end endure",
    "The cross, shall wear the crown.",
    "4",
    "Thrice blessed bliss-inspiring hope!",
    "It lifts the fainting spirits up,",
    "It brings to life the dead;",
    "Our conflicts here shall soon be past,",
    "And you and I ascend at last",
    "Triumphant with our head.",
    "5",
    "The great mysterious Deity",
    "We soon with open face shall see;",
    "The beatific sight",
    "Shall fill heaven\u2019s sounding courts with praise,",
    "And wide diffuse the golden blaze",
    "Of everlasting light.",
    "6",
    "The Father shining on his throne,",
    "The glorious, co-eternal Son,",
    "The Spirit, one and seven,",
    "Conspire our rapture to complete,",
    "And lo! we fall before his feet,",
    "And silence heightens heaven.",
    "7",
    "In hope of that ecstatic pause,",
    "Jesu, we now sustain the cross,",
    "And at thy footstool fall,",
    "Till thou our hidden life reveal,",
    "Till thou our ravished spirits fill,",
    "And God is all in all."

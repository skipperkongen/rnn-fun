    "After the jostling on canal streets",
    "and the orchids blowing in the window",
    "I work in cut glass and majolica",
    "and hear the plectrum of the angels.",
    "My thoughts keep dwelling on the littoral",
    "where china clocks tick in the cold shells",
    "and the weeds slide in the equinox.",
    "The night is cold for love,",
    "a chamber for the chorus",
    "and the antistrophe of the sealight."

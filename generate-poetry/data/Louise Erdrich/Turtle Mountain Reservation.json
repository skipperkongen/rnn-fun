    "The heron makes a cross",
    "flying low over the marsh.",
    "Its heart is an old compass",
    "pointing off in four directions.",
    "It drags the world along,",
    "the world it becomes.",
    "My face surfaces in the green",
    "beveled glass above the washstand.",
    "My handprint in thick black powder",
    "on the bedroom shade.",
    "Home I could drink like thin fire",
    "that gathers",
    "like lead in my veins,",
    "heart\u2019s armor, the coffee stains.",
    "In the dust of the double hollyhock,",
    "Theresa, one frail flame eating wind.",
    "One slim candle",
    "that snaps in the dry grass.",
    "Ascending tall ladders",
    "that walk to the edge of dusk.",
    "Riding a blue cricket",
    "through the tumult of the falling dawn.",
    "At dusk the gray owl walks the length of the roof,",
    "sharpening its talons on the shingles.",
    "Grandpa leans back",
    "between spoonfuls of canned soup",
    "and repeats to himself a word",
    "that belongs to a world",
    "no one else can remember.",
    "The day has not come",
    "when from sloughs, the great salamander",
    "lumbers through snow, salt, and fire",
    "to be with him, throws the hatchet",
    "of its head through the door of the three-room house",
    "and eats the blue roses that are peeling off the walls.",
    "Uncle Ray, drunk for three days",
    "behind the jagged window",
    "of a new government box,",
    "drapes himself in fallen curtains, and dreams that the odd",
    "beast seen near Cannonball, North Dakota,",
    "crouches moaning at the door to his body. The latch",
    "is the small hook and eye.",
    "of religion. Twenty nuns",
    "fall through clouds to park their butts",
    "on the metal hasp. Surely that",
    "would be considered miraculous almost anyplace,",
    "but here in the Turtle Mountains",
    "it is no more than common fact.",
    "Raymond wakes,",
    "but he can\u2019t shrug them off. He is looking up",
    "dark tunnels of their sleeves,",
    "and into their frozen armpits,",
    "or is it heaven? He counts the points",
    "of their hairs like stars.",
    "One by one they blink out,",
    "and Theresa comes forth",
    "clothed in the lovely hair",
    "she has been washing all day. She smells",
    "like a hayfield, drifting pollen",
    "of birch trees.",
    "Her hair steals across her shoulders",
    "like a postcard sunset.",
    "All the boys tonight, goaded from below,",
    "will approach her in The Blazer, The Tomahawk,",
    "The White Roach Bar where everyone",
    "gets up to cut the rug, wagging everything they got,",
    "as the one bass drum of The Holy Greaseballs",
    "lights a depth",
    "charge through the smoke.",
    "Grandpa leans closer to the bingo.",
    "The small fortune his heart pumps for",
    "is hidden in the stained, dancing numbers.",
    "The Ping-Pong balls rise through colored lights,",
    "brief as sparrows",
    "God is in the sleight of the woman\u2019s hand.",
    "He walks from Saint Ann\u2019s, limp and crazy",
    "as the loon that calls its children",
    "across the lake",
    "in its broke, knowing laughter.",
    "Hitchhiking home from the Mission, if he sings,",
    "it is a loud, rasping wail",
    "that saws through the spine",
    "of Ira Comes Last, at the wheel.",
    "Drawn up through the neck ropes,",
    "drawn out of his stomach",
    "by the spirit of the stones that line",
    "the road and speak",
    "to him only in their old agreement.",
    "Ira knows the old man is nuts.",
    "Lets him out at the road that leads up",
    "over stars and the skulls of white cranes.",
    "And through the soft explosions of cattail",
    "and the scattering of seeds on still water,",
    "walks Grandpa, all the time that there is in his hands",
    "that have grown to be the twisted doubles",
    "of the burrows of mole and badger,",
    "that have come to be the absence",
    "of birds in a nest.",
    "Hands of earth, of this clay",
    "I\u2019m also made from."

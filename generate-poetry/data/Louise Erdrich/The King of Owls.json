    "They say I am excitable! How could",
    "I not scream? The Swiss monk\u2019s tonsure",
    "spun till it blurred yet his eyes were still.",
    "I snapped my gaiter, hard, to stuff back",
    "my mirth. Lords, he then began to speak.",
    "he said,",
    "in which the state of the world is excellent described",
    "and figured. He decked his mouth",
    "as they do, a solemn stitch, and left cards",
    "in my hands. I cast them down.",
    "What need have I for amusement?",
    "My brain\u2019s a park. Yet your company",
    "plucked them from the ground and began to play.",
    "Lords, I wither. The monk spoke right,",
    "the mealy wretch. The sorry patterns show",
    "the deceiving constructions of your minds.",
    "I have made the Deuce of Ravens my sword",
    "falling through your pillows and rising,",
    "the wing blades still running",
    "with the jugular blood. Your bodies lurch",
    "through the steps of an unpleasant dance.",
    "No lutes play. I have silenced the lutes!",
    "I keep watch in the clipped, convulsed garden.",
    "I must have silence, to hear the messenger\u2019s footfall",
    "in my brain. For I am the King of Owls.",
    "Where I float no shadow falls.",
    "I have hungers, such terrible hungers, you cannot know.",
    "Lords, I sharpen my talons on your bones."

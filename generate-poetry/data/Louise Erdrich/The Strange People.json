    "\u2014Pretty Shield,",
    "Medicine Woman of the Crows",
    "All night I am the doe, breathing",
    "his name in a frozen field,",
    "the small mist of the word",
    "drifting always before me.",
    "And again he has heard it",
    "and I have gone burning",
    "to meet him, the jacklight",
    "fills my eyes with blue fire;",
    "the heart in my chest",
    "explodes like a hot stone.",
    "Then slung like a sack",
    "in the back of his pickup,",
    "I wipe the death scum",
    "from my mouth, sit up laughing",
    "and shriek in my speeding grave.",
    "Safely shut in the garage,",
    "when he sharpens his knife",
    "and thinks to have me, like that,",
    "I come toward him,",
    "a lean gray witch",
    "through the bullets that enter and dissolve.",
    "I sit in his house",
    "drinking coffee till dawn",
    "and leave as frost reddens on hubcaps,",
    "crawling back into my shadowy body.",
    "All day, asleep in clean grasses,",
    "I dream of the one who could really wound me.",
    "Not with weapons, not with a kiss, not with a look.",
    "Not even with his goodness.",
    "If a man was never to lie to me.",
    "I swear I would never leave him."

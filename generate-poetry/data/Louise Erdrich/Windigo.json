    "You knew I was coming for you, little one,",
    "when the kettle jumped into the fire.",
    "Towels flapped on the hooks,",
    "and the dog crept off, groaning,",
    "to the deepest part of the woods.",
    "In the hackles of dry brush a thin laughter started up.",
    "Mother scolded the food warm and smooth in the pot",
    "and called you to eat.",
    "But I spoke in the cold trees:",
    "The sumac pushed sour red cones through the air.",
    "Copper burned in the raw wood.",
    "You saw me drag toward you.",
    "Oh touch me, I murmured, and licked the soles of your feet.",
    "You dug your hands into my pale, melting fur.",
    "I stole you off, a huge thing in my bristling armor.",
    "Steam rolled from my wintry arms, each leaf shivered",
    "from the bushes we passed",
    "until they stood, naked, spread like the cleaned spines of fish.",
    "Then your warm hands hummed over and shoveled themselves full",
    "of the ice and the snow. I would darken and spill",
    "all night running, until at last morning broke the cold earth",
    "and I carried you home,",
    "a river shaking in the sun."

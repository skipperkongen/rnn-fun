    "Between my finger and my thumb",
    "The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.",
    "Under my window, a clean rasping sound",
    "When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:",
    "My father, digging. I look down",
    "Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds",
    "Bends low, comes up twenty years away",
    "Stooping in rhythm through potato drills",
    "Where he was digging.",
    "The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft",
    "Against the inside knee was levered firmly.",
    "He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep",
    "To scatter new potatoes that we picked,",
    "Loving their cool hardness in our hands.",
    "By God, the old man could handle a spade.",
    "Just like his old man.",
    "My grandfather cut more turf in a day",
    "Than any other man on Toner\u2019s bog.",
    "Once I carried him milk in a bottle",
    "Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up",
    "To drink it, then fell to right away",
    "Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods",
    "Over his shoulder, going down and down",
    "For the good turf. Digging.",
    "The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap",
    "Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge",
    "Through living roots awaken in my head.",
    "But I\u2019ve no spade to follow men like them.",
    "Between my finger and my thumb",
    "The squat pen rests.",
    "I\u2019ll dig with it."

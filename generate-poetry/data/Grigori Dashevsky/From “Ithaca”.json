    "The night approaches. Dusk drafts on buildings",
    "their future ruins. Dusk deepens windows",
    "and apertures. It hollows stones",
    "with shadows like with water. It foretells",
    "the near death of a hundred clouds",
    "to the shining host. A thin layer of dust,",
    "the seer leaves his footprints on the roofs",
    "as he walks home from the future",
    "not his own, swallowing his voice \u2014",
    "in its rays, fat blood flows down",
    "the golden armor. Wet",
    "blue entrails. Large heads",
    "have rolled down the shoulders.",
    "Speech has grown silent in deep mouths.",
    ".................................................",
    "The signs of a life without past will emerge",
    "like lies through the lines of an old page,",
    "emptiness will turn into loss,",
    "foreign sand into Ithaca.",
    "Ithaca is the time",
    "when there\u2019s nowhere to go. If it\u2019s night,",
    "it means the night is the end of the voyage.",
    "A sackcloth hiding the shoulders",
    "of the stranger is truer than",
    "speeches about past and future",
    "he won\u2019t make. Nobody",
    "will. On the streets rain readies",
    "hollows for the funeral, already",
    "overgrown with grass.",
    "In a long puddle he sees:",
    "a pauper, a random victim of the skies",
    "hangs with his head down.",
    "In height, he is a cloud, the size",
    "of a lost faith",
    "in returning home.",
    ".......................",
    "So should I, a pauper sitting",
    "by a stranger\u2019s door, declare:",
    ",",
    ". Should I say:",
    "tears are still rolling down my face. I have been",
    "summoned to clothe the past",
    "in the shining ice.",
    "The twilight pushes a heavy box of reflection",
    "out of the windows",
    "and thumbs through a pale face",
    "as if it were a stack of letters lying in a vacuum,",
    "written by an unfamiliar hand.",
    "You are in Ithaca, but you are not yet home.",
    "The soul goes home the way of flesh,",
    "clothed in white rags,",
    "so that to say",
    "upon arrival:",
    "and I am recognized. Window water,",
    "vapor of window reflections",
    "harden not in the shining of the ice",
    "that has come out of a secret thought,",
    "but from a permanent neighboring frame,",
    "which has embraced life into its shores of death,",
    "where my steps on the sand",
    "are uneven and filled with water.",
    "Old rags are stronger than old life.",
    "Night, like dead water, sows together",
    "the tattered contours of the past.",
    "A stranger\u2019s death is a seed of your homeland,",
    "sprouting from the graveyard statues,",
    "from the clouds, forever still."

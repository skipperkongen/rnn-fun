    "When the sun\u2019s whiteness closes around us",
    "Like a noose,",
    "It is noon, and Molina squats",
    "In the uneven shade of an oleander.",
    "He unfolds a map and, with a pencil,",
    "Blackens Panama",
    "Into a bruise;",
    "He dots rain over Bogot\u00e1, the city of spiders,",
    "And x\u2019s in a mountain range that climbs",
    "Like a thermometer",
    "Above the stone fence",
    "The old never thought to look over.",
    "A fog presses over Lima.",
    "Brazil is untangled of its rivers.",
    "Where there is a smudge,",
    "Snow has stitched its cold into the field.",
    "Where the river Orinoco cuts east,",
    "A new river rises nameless",
    "From the open grasses,",
    "And Molina calls it his place of birth."

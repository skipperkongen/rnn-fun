    "The clouds shouldered a path up the mountains",
    "East of Ocampo, and then descended,",
    "Scraping their bellies gray on the cracked shingles of slate.",
    "They entered the valley, and passed the roads that went",
    "Trackless, the houses blown open, their cellars creaking",
    "And lined with the bottles that held their breath for years.",
    "They passed the fields where the trees dried thin as hat racks",
    "And the plow\u2019s tooth bit the earth for what endured.",
    "But what continued were the wind that plucked the birds spineless",
    "And the young who left with a few seeds in each pocket,",
    "Their belts tightened on the fifth notch of hunger\u0097",
    "Under the sky that deafened from listening for rain."

    "\u201cIt\u2019s a \u201949,\u201d Rhinehardt said, and slammed",
    "The screen door, then worked his way around",
    "The dog turds in the yard",
    "To the Buick gutted from fire\u0097the gears",
    "Teething rust, the fenders sloped",
    "Like the shoulders of a fired worker",
    "Out of beer. He circled the car",
    "Kicking the tires, eyeing",
    "The grille that still grinned the ribbed wings",
    "Of a sparrow. He looked inside and flies",
    "Lifted like patted dust, settling",
    "Into a loose knot on the visor.",
    "\u201cYeh, you\u2019re right as right ... it\u2019s a \u201950,\u201d",
    "Rhinehardt spat, his tongue rolling",
    "A false tooth into place. \u201cIt\u2019s got no",
    "Running board.\u201d He pressed a buck",
    "Into his son\u2019s hand and retired to the porch",
    "Where he towel-flicked",
    "His wife from a chair",
    "And as evening came on watched beyond",
    "The street, a kennel of trees,",
    "Where\u0097as he had dreamed\u0097a plane would drop",
    "And bloom fire. Two bucks on that one."

    "Today it\u2019s going to cost us twenty dollars",
    "To live. Five for a softball. Four for a book,",

    "Bus fare, rosin for your mother\u2019s violin.",
    "We\u2019re completing our task. The tip I left",
    "For the waitress filters down",
    "Like rain, wetting the new roots of a child",
    "Perhaps, a belligerent cat that won\u2019t let go",
    "Of a balled sock until there\u2019s chicken to eat.",
    "As far as I can tell, daughter, it works like this:",
    "You buy bread from a grocery, a bag of apples",
    "From a fruit stand, and what coins",
    "Are passed on helps others buy pencils, glue,",
    "Tickets to a movie in which laughter",
    "Is thrown into their faces.",
    "If we buy a goldfish, someone tries on a hat.",
    "If we buy crayons, someone walks home with a broom.",
    "A tip, a small purchase here and there,",
    "And things just keep going. I guess."

    "What a thing it would be, if we all could fly.",
    "But to rise on air does not make you a bird.",
    "I\u2019m sick of the hiss of champagne bubbles.",
    "It\u2019s spring, and everyone\u2019s got something to puke.",
    "The things we puke: flights of stairs,",
    "a skyscraper soaring from the gut,",
    "the bills blow by on the April breeze",
    "followed by flurries of razor blades in May.",
    "It\u2019s true, a free life is made of words.",
    "You can crumple it, toss it in the trash,",
    "or fold it between the bodies of angels, attaining",
    "a permanent address in the sky.",
    "The postman hands you your flight of birds",
    "persisting in the original shape of wind.",
    "Whether they\u2019re winging toward the scissors\u2019 V",
    "or printed and plastered on every wall",
    "or bound and trussed, bamboo frames wound with wire",
    "or sentenced to death by fire",
    "you are, first",
    "and always, ash.",
    "Broken wire, a hurricane at each end.",
    "Fire trucks scream across the earth.",
    "But this blaze is a thing of the air.",
    "Raise your glass higher, toss it up and away.",
    "Few know this kind of dizzy glee:",
    "an empty sky, a pair of burning wings."

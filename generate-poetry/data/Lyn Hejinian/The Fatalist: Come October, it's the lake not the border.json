    "Come October, it\u2019s the lake not the border",
    "that has been redrawn. Thinking",
    "about the event afterwards, I realize how remarkably well-prepared",
    "the girls are. There don\u2019t seem to be any slouches",
    "among them. Please tell them I say hello and that we\u2019ll need 14",
    "for the green salad and 14 for the apple tarts between",
    "with some rapid washing in clear water I remember as play",
    "and planning in childhood, preparing until the very last moment",
    "for a gripping narrative that was itself perpetually given over",
    "to improvisations and asymmetrical collaborations that could run",
    "for days. That makes another 14. It was \u201dthe word\u201c or \u201cthe world\u201d in 1981",
    "when we undertook to talk about the phrase",
    "\u201conce in a while\u201d once in a while",
    "noting the vagueness then named \u201ca while\u201d and how \u201conce\u201d the phrase",
    "recurs and therefore means more than once",
    "the \u201cwhile\u201d is defined. We too are in \u201ca while\u201d",
    "and when \u201conce\u201d next occurs, if the basic design suits",
    "you, we will need a bit of modestly biographical contextualization",
    "for November. I\u2019m going to put some thought to something",
    "implausibly contemporary which perhaps isn\u2019t wise",
    "since between then and now no new coincidences have been noted",
    "just one large color photograph of bespangled cowgirls",
    "herding heavy bulls up the avenue that opens this week carefully",
    "wearing baby blue boots to take out the garbage",
    "but it never rained. At the end of the month, Halloween should be clear."

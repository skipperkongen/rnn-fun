    "But isn\u2019t midnight intermittent",
    "Or was that just a whispered nine",
    "A snap of blown light low against the flank of a cow",
    "A likeness of something numberless that only I not knowing the sound",
    "might know",
    "It may have been howled by a circling dog being chastised \u2014 threatened \u2014",
    "by multiples of itself in pursuit of the consolation of knowing that",
    "everything is real",
    "It was real",
    "I don\u2019t mean midnight \u2014 despite horizon, nipple, and fissure",
    "I don\u2019t mean",
    "And yet I do \u2014 mean, I mean",
    "A cowering animal woven real",
    "flickers",
    "please pull over",
    "Kierkegaard",
    "Kierkegaard says knowledge precedes every act but surely there are acts that",
    "are not preceded by knowledge. Repetitions pass at the door from summer",
    "to winter. Some slowly. Some quickly. Total strangers. Never saw them",
    "before. Can\u2019t picture them now. Umbrellas \u2014 strange totalities \u2014 upheld,",
    "wheeling."

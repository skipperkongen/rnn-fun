    "The water was rising, I got up on the bed",
    "Still wearing the Hawaiian shirt he had on yesterday",
    "He used his thoughts to draw a rudimentary circle on the wall",
    "Hitting Beirut and killing 22 civilians",
    "But now go the bells, and we are ready",
    "Novelty is no better than repetition",
    "That graces the walls of toilet stalls with hooey",
    "And comparison with the dead\u2014their slimy cruelty\u2014and meatballs",
    "Perched like ghostly birds",
    "Believing in old men\u2019s lies, then too late unbelieving",
    "There\u2019s rough life in the rust",
    "Long-buried whore\u2019s eggs, razor-clams with shells",
    "Pirates dressed in pink and pit-bulls on parade",
    "With power to extend the longevity of learned fear in the mouse",
    "And a heron on the horizon many sewing-days ago",
    "Jane, Jane, ascend the stairs",
    "Of the river\u2019s mouth at the year\u2019s turn",
    "Thus predicting the shock to the tale that so entertains grown children",
    "Of the animals that have nearly all forsaken us"

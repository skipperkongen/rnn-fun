    "The best words get said frequently\u2014they are like fertile pips.",
    "Apples fall heavily to the ground and lie in the sun, their scent",
    "abandoning them as a philosophy which cannot be further perfected. Love",
    "releases playful sensations even from serious things providing a life",
    "to think about. Take R\u2014the only thing",
    "R could credit herself with was having lived",
    "her life and so she not only kept an account of it",
    "but did so not in the privacy of a diary but in the form of letters",
    "\u2014abundant, profligate, indiscrete\u2014that I want to write",

    "R bequeaths herself to posterity as a scholar might",
    "bequeath his or her library blowing twisted veils of rain",
    "past the narrow and curving windows in the last hour that will carry us along",
    "to the time when those who come after us will learn",
    "what we know\u2014a man with a mustache waxed and dyed",
    "green, a line of tall people and a woman at the door, a committee",
    "of children without scooters but not mournful, a poet with a motive, a pilot",
    "with a flashlight, a sulking but fascinated scholar, and Goethe no doubt",
    "for whom R would have released a flock of red canaries."

    "on the ground can spook a horse who won\u2019t flinch when faced",
    "with a backhoe or a pack of Harleys. I call it \u201chorse",
    "ophthalmology,\u201d because it is a different kind of system\u2014",
    "not celestial, necessarily, but vision in which the small,",
    "the wispy, the lightly lifted or stirring threads of existence",
    "excite more fear than louder and larger bodies do. It\u2019s Matthew",
    "who said that the light of the body is the eye, and that if",
    "the eye is healthy the whole body will be full of light. Maybe",
    "in this case \u201clight\u201d can also mean \u201clightness.\u201d With my eyes of",
    "corrupted and corruptible flesh I\u2019m afraid I see mostly darkness",
    "by which I mean heaviness. How great is that darkness? Not",
    "as great as the inner weightlessness of horses whose eyes perceive,",
    "correctly I believe, the threat of annihilation in every windblown",
    "dust mote of malignant life. All these years I\u2019ve been watching",
    "out warily in obvious places (in bars, in wars, in night cities and",

    "me has lain hidden inside friendly-seeming breezes, behind",
    "soft music, beneath the carpet of small things one can barely see.",
    "The eye is also a lamp, says Matthew, a giver of light, bestower",
    "of incandescent honey, which I will pour more cautiously",
    "over the courses I travel from now on. What\u2019s that whisper?",
    "Just the delicate sweeping away of somebody\u2019s life."

    "Smoketrees line the roadside, still-bare beech and poplar",
    "bouqueted with redbud and something rusty I can't name,",
    "March's odd autumnals \u2014",
    "One-church towns I'm glad",
    "not to be from, split-log strip mall with a porch",
    "where Claire's beauty shop shares a sign with \"Antigues,\" where you study grace",
    "in magazines, and when dad dies you rename the family diner",
    "New York New York. Love is a means of travel, so you dye",
    "the linens pink and swan-fold napkins, holding",
    "in your mouth. Sundays drive out to watch the ferry",
    "drag its lace.",
    "Coastward, Easter-colored clapboard,",
    "the last generation's shanties hovering on narrow stilts",
    "above the velour drift of tide plain (mink from a distance,",
    "muskrat up close), a drowsy instrumental music,",
    "flooded at dusk. Beside the bridge, smooth brow of pewter.",
    "Island of saplings blackened like a framed-up house."

    "His piercing pince-nez. Some dim frieze",
    "Hands point to a dim frieze, in the dark night.",

    "Which owe their presence to our sleeping hands.",
    "The ox-blood from the hands which play",
    "For fire for warmth for hands for growth",
    "Is there room in the room that you room in?",
    "Upon his structured tomb:",
    "Still they mean something. For the dance",
    "And the architecture.",

    "May be portentous to him",
    "We are the sleeping fragments of his sky,",

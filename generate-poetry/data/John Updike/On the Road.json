    "Those dutiful dogtrots down airport corridors",
    "while gnawing at a Dunkin' Donuts cruller,",
    "those hotel rooms where the TV remote",
    "waits by the bed like a suicide pistol,",
    "those hours in the air amid white shirts",
    "whose wearers sleep-read through thick staid thrillers,",
    "those breakfast buffets in prairie Marriotts\u2014",
    "such venues of transit grow dearer than home.",
    "The tricycle in the hall, the wife's hasty kiss,",
    "the dripping faucet and uncut lawn\u2014this is life?",
    "No,",
    "thrives via the road, in the laptop",
    "whose silky screen shimmers like a dark queen's mirror,",
    "in the polished shoe that signifies killer intent,",
    "and in the solitary mission, a bumpy glide",
    "down through the cloud cover to a single runway",
    "at whose end a man just like you guards the Grail."

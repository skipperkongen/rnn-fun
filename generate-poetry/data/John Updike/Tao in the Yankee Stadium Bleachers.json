    "Distance brings proportion. From here",
    "the populated tiers",
    "as much as players seem part of the show:",
    "a constructed stage beast, three folds of Dante\u2019s rose,",
    "or a Chinese military hat",
    "cunningly chased with bodies.",
    "\u201cFalling from his chariot, a drunk man is unhurt",
    "because his soul is intact. Not knowing his fall,",
    "he is unastonished, he is invulnerable.\u201d",
    "So, too, the \u201cpure man\u201d\u0097\u201cpure\u201d",
    "in the sense of undisturbed water.",
    "\u201cIt is not necessary to seek out",
    "a wasteland, swamp, or thicket.\u201d",
    "The opposing pitcher\u2019s pertinent hesitations,",
    "the sky, this meadow, Mantle\u2019s thick baked neck,",
    "the old men who in the changing rosters see",
    "a personal mutability,",
    "green slats, wet stone are all to me",
    "as when an emperor commands",
    "a performance with a gesture of his eyes.",
    "\u201cNo king on his throne has the joy of the dead,\u201d",
    "the skull told Chuang-tzu.",
    "The thought of death is peppermint to you",
    "when games begin with patriotic song",
    "and a democratic sun beats broadly down.",
    "The Inner Journey seems unjudgeably long",
    "when small boys purchase cups of ice",
    "and, distant as a paradise,",
    "experts, passionate and deft,",
    "hold motionless while Berra flies to left."

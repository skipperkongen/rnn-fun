    "We keep my sister alive by force,",
    "pin her down and nurse her with raw",
    "eggs from the chickens that did not drown",
    "and milk taken from a goat staked",
    "to the ground. The dull tolling of the bell",
    "around her neck speaks as she moves.",
    ". She wanders to the river,",
    "and we find her. In a tree, singing",
    "to a starling, we find her. We dig a grave",
    "for the missing body, but nothing",
    "consoles her. In mourning, the cure",
    "is the sickness. A year ago, a lion",
    "took our mother as she tended the fire.",
    ". We found half",
    "of her bones and buried her",
    "uneaten heart in a dead cub's rib cage.",
    "When we returned three days later",
    "we saw no bones, no heart, only tracks",
    "in the sand leading east.",
    ".",
    ". We're always at the mercy",
    "of one menacing grace, one rite, an art",
    "that makes us suffer twice. At night we wait",
    "with out knives where the tall grass begins.",
    "We will kill it or die or become the lion."

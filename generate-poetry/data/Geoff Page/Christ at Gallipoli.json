    "Bit weird at first,",
    "That starey look in the eyes,",
    "The hair down past his shoulders,",
    "But after a go with the ship\u2019s barber,",
    "A sea-water shower and the old slouch hat",
    "Across his ears, he started to look the part.",
    "Took him a while to get the way",
    "A bayonet fits the old Lee-Enfield,",
    "But going in on the boats",
    "He looked calmer than any of us,",
    "Just gazing in over the swell",
    "Where the cliffs looked black against the sky.",
    "When we hit he fairly raced in through the waves,",
    "Then up the beach, swerving like a full-back at the end",
    "When the Turks\u2019d really got on to us.",
    "Time we all caught up,",
    "He was off like a flash, up the cliffs,",
    "After his first machine gun.",
    "He\u2019d done for three Turks when we got there,",
    "The fourth was a gibbering mess.",
    "Seeing him wave that blood-red bayonet,",
    "I reckoned we were glad",
    "To have him on the side."

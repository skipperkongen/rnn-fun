    "It is hard even to admit this theory of hats, that to wear",
    "The faithless one brimmed tightly over the eyes\u2014",
    "The featherless and discreet one, a hat with a secret code",
    "That says,",
    "\u2014",
    "To wear that hat (imperfectly as a crow\u2019s crown) against the sun",
    "Is to bear the ruins of the unborn into our hearts\u2014",
    "He, shouting at the brunt of trees;",
    "She, shifting like a seer to restore them.",
    "It is hard to know happiness with a hat like that.",
    "Or to forget the pangs sung with such burly impatience,",
    "Or to heal the blurred things and soft hurts.",
    "Even the blind self becomes a dervish, what with the torsion",
    "And the far-off",
    "like a new virus or virtuoso,",
    "What with the tussles and old, pure-lit suppressions.",
    "Then to be surprised by joy: Like the last rain of summer,",
    "The big, spiraling, wounded animal of rain",
    "With no place to turn, drumming the brown grass,",
    "Rain falling without meaning, but perfectly faithful,",
    "Into the petals of wind and the unopened roots\u2014",
    "Such tenderness looked to, like love, but unquestioned.",
    "Then some afternoon with the sky lifting off again,",
    "She will come to sit on the porch like a dark sparrow",
    "And let the sun creep slowly onto her hair",
    "And grow old and wonder about the balance of things.",
    "And he beside her, sitting, too, distracted in the sun for hours,",
    "But all the same, both of them, at last, so much warmer."

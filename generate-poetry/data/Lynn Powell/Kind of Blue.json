    "Not Delft or",
    "delphinium, not Wedgewood",
    "among the knickknacks, not wide-eyed chicory",
    "evangelizing in the devil strip\u2014",
    "But way on down in the moonless",
    "octave below midnight, honey,",
    "way down where you can't tell cerulean",
    "from teal.",
    "Not Mason jars of moonshine, not",
    "waverings of silk, not the long-legged hunger",
    "of a heron or the peacock's",
    "iridescent id\u2014",
    "But Delilahs of darkness, darling,",
    "and the muscle of the mind",
    "giving in.",
    "Not sullen snow slumped",
    "against the garden, not the first instinct of flame,",
    "not small, stoic ponds, or the cold derangement",
    "of a jealous sea\u2014",
    "But bluer than the lips of Lazarus, baby,",
    "before Sweet Jesus himself could figure out",
    "what else in the world to do but weep."

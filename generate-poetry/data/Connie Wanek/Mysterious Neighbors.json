    "Country people rise early",
    "as their distant lights testify.",
    "They don\u2019t hold water in common. Each house",
    "has a personal source, like a bank account,",
    "a stone vault. Some share eggs,",
    "some share expertise,",
    "and some won\u2019t even wave.",
    "A walk for the mail elevates the heart rate.",
    "Last November I saw a woman down the road",
    "walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange",
    "cap to boot, a cautious soul.",
    "Bullets can\u2019t read her No Trespassing sign.",
    "Strange to think they\u2019re in the air",
    "like lead bees with a fatal sting.",
    "Our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen",
    "with his rifle handy and the window open.",
    "You never know when. Once",
    "he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill.",
    "He\u2019s in his seventies, born here, joined the Navy,",
    "came back. Hard work never hurt a man",
    "until suddenly he was another broken tool.",
    "His silhouette against the dawn",
    "droops as though drought-stricken, each step",
    "deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox,",
    "prying it open. Checking a trap."

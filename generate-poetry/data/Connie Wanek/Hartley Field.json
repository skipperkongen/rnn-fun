    "The wind cooled as it crossed the open pond",
    "and drove little waves toward us,",
    "brisk, purposeful waves",
    "that vanished at our feet, such energy",
    "thwarted by so little elevation.",
    "The wind was endless, seamless,",
    "old as the earth.",
    "Insects came",
    "to regard us with favor. I felt them alight,",
    "felt their minute footfalls.",
    "I was a challenge, an Everest . . .",
    "And you, whom I have heard breathe all night,",
    "sigh through the water of sleep",
    "with vestigial gills . . .",
    "A pair of dragonflies drifted past us, silent,",
    "while higher up two bullet-shaped jets",
    "dragged their roars behind them",
    "on unbreakable chains. It seemed a pity",
    "we\u2019d given up the sky to them, but I understand so little.",
    "Perhaps it was necessary.",
    "All our years together\u2014",
    "and not just together. Surely by now",
    "we have the same blood type, the same myopia.",
    "Sometimes I think we\u2019re the same sex,",
    "the one in the middle of man and woman,",
    "born of both as every child is.",
    "The waves came to us, one each heartbeat,",
    "and lay themselves at our feet.",
    "The swelling goes down.",
    "The fever cools.",
    "There, where the Hartleys grew lettuce eighty years ago",
    "bear and beaver, fox and partridge",
    "den and nest and hunt",
    "and are hunted. I wish I had the means",
    "to give all the north back to itself, to let the pines",
    "rise in the hayfield and the lilacs go wild.",
    "But then where would we live?",
    "I wanted that hour with you all winter\u2014",
    "I thought of it while I worked,",
    "before I slept and when I woke,",
    "a time when the tangled would straighten,",
    "when contrition would become benediction:",
    "the positive hour, shining like mica.",
    "At last the wind brought it to us across the pond,",
    "then took it up again, every last minute."

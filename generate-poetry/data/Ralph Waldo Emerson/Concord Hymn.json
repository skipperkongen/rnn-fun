    "By the rude bridge that arched the flood,",
    "Their flag to April\u2019s breeze unfurled,",
    "Here once the embattled farmers stood",
    "And fired the shot heard round the world.",
    "The foe long since in silence slept;",
    "Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;",
    "And Time the ruined bridge has swept",
    "Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.",
    "On this green bank, by this soft stream,",
    "We set today a votive stone;",
    "That memory may their deed redeem,",
    "When, like our sires, our sons are gone.",
    "Spirit, that made those heroes dare",
    "To die, and leave their children free,",
    "Bid Time and Nature gently spare",
    "The shaft we raise to them and thee."

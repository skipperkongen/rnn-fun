    "My books are full of mistakes",
    "but not the ones Tony\u2019s always pointing out",
    "as if correct spelling is what could stop the conveyor belt",
    "the new kid caught his arm in.",
    "Three weeks on the job and he\u2019s already six hundred",
    "legal pages, lawyers haggling in an office",
    "with an ignored view of the river",
    "pretending to be asleep, pretending",
    "to have insight into its muddy self.",
    "You think that\u2019s a fucked-up, drawn-out metaphor,",
    "try this: if you feel you\u2019re writhing like a worm",
    "in a bottle of tequila, you don\u2019t know",
    "it\u2019s the quickness of its death that reveals",
    "the quality of the product, its proof.",
    "I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about either.",
    "Do you think the dictionary ever says to itself",
    "I\u2019ve got these words that mean completely",
    "different things inside myself",
    "and it\u2019s tearing me apart?",
    "My errors are even bigger than that.",
    "You start taking down the walls of your house,",
    "sooner or later it\u2019ll collapse",
    "but not before you can walk around",
    "with your eyes closed, rolled backwards",
    "and staring straight into the amygdala\u2019s meatlocker",
    "and your own damn self hanging there.",
    "Do that for awhile and it\u2019s easier to delight",
    "in snow that lasts about twenty minutes",
    "longer than a life held together",
    "by the twisted silver baling wire",
    "of deception and stealth.",
    "But I ain\u2019t confessing nothing.",
    "On mornings when I hope you forget my name,",
    "I walk through the high wet weeds",
    "that don\u2019t have names either.",
    "I do not remember the word dew.",
    "I do not remember what I told you",
    "with your ear in my teeth.",
    "Further and further into the weeds.",
    "We have absolutely no proof",
    "god isn\u2019t an insect",
    "rubbing her hind legs together to sing.",
    "Or boring into us like a yellow jacket",
    "into a fallen, overripe pear.",
    "Or an assassin bug squatting over us,",
    "shoving a proboscis right through",
    "our breast plate then sipping.",
    "How wonderful our poisons don\u2019t kill her."

    "My poor students, all I ask of them",
    "is to grow antennae, lie down with lava",
    "and rise with snow, grow tongues from",
    "their math assignments and no, Melissa,",
    "your mother won\u2019t approve of the bioluminescent",
    "smear on your communion dress. The world fidgets",
    "in uneasy relationship to our statements",
    "about it nevertheless producing silver",
    "buds from ragged limbs like the luster",
    "in late Frank Sinatra songs. Finally,",
    "when I got off the sixth floor, I felt",
    "like I was walking out into the sky",
    "and aren\u2019t we all pedestrians of air?",
    "Doesn\u2019t it feel all wrong to turn our backs",
    "on the ocean? On an ant? On those Chagall",
    "windows you have to go through a gauntlet",
    "of ancient armor to get to? What was her name,",
    "that night nurse so deft her blood draws",
    "didn\u2019t wake me up? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want",
    "to wake up. I want my old dog to show me",
    "all that wolf-light she hides inside",
    "even though she thinks I won\u2019t understand,",
    "even though her vet and I conspire",
    "to keep her alive forever."

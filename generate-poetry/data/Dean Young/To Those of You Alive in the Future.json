    "our own ghosts in a world made brief with flowers.",
    "To you, our agonies and tizzies",

    "or the stung beekeeper",

    "On Monday, it sleeted in Pennsylvania",
    "while someone\u2019s mother was scoured further",
    "from her own mind. A son-in-law smoked",
    "in the parking lot, exhaling white curses",
    "torn apart by the large invisible indifference.",
    "The general anesthetic wore off",
    "and someone else opened her eyes to the results.",
    "In this way our world was broken and glued.",
    "But why did we bother shooing away the flies?",
    "Did we think we could work our way",
    "inside a diamond if we ground more pigment",
    "into the paper\u2019s tooth, tried to hold fire",
    "on our tongues, sucked at the sugars of each other?",
    "Many the engagement rings in the pawnshop.",
    "Many the empties piled at the curbs.",

    "chunks of ice tugged by bickering currents.",
    "One who slept late reached out",

    "and sweet, were pulled from wide infernos",
    "of stone ovens. My name was Dean Young,",
    "I wrote it on a leaf. Sometimes",
    "I could still manage to get lost",
    "there was no guidance system wired inside me yet.",
    "Laughter might have come from a window",
    "lit far into the night, others were dark",
    "and always silent."

    "More than the beetles turned russet,",
    "sunset, dragging their shield, more than",
    "the crickets who think it\u2019s evening all afternoon,",
    "it\u2019s the bees I love this time of year.",
    "Sated, maybe drunk, who\u2019ve lapped at the hips",
    "of too many flowers for one summer but",
    "still must go on hunting, one secret",
    "closing, another ensuing, picking",
    "lock after lock, rapping the glass,",
    "getting stuck in a puddle of dish soap,",
    "almost winter, almost dark, reading far past",
    "the last paragraph into the back blank page,",
    "acknowledgments, and history of type.",
    "I think when my head finally cracks",
    "out will come one of those ravening scouts",
    "autumnal with hunger beyond any sipping,",
    "swallowing, beyond the hive\u2019s teeming",
    "factory\u2019s needs. I think maybe then,",
    "when I\u2019m dying like a bug in a puddle",
    "of dish soap, I\u2019ll be relieved,",
    "my wings wet capes and not working,",
    "antennae slicked back and not working,",
    "eye that sees the ruby above going out,",
    "eye that sees the ruby within getting brighter",
    "as I drag myself to a tomato ripening",
    "on the window sill, reddest, softest",
    "island of my last planet, last aureola,",
    "stinger waving and useless. I\u2019ll wait then,",
    "while air from the north rushes gulf air,",
    "a tree indicating wildly, each leaf woke",
    "in orange outcry. It won\u2019t be suffering,",
    "exactly. Rain coming, then gone, a chill",
    "that means all my barbarous kind are alone",
    "and perishing, our unrecognizable young",
    "buried and waiting, bodies of fire becoming",
    "bodies of air. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way",
    "to prepare."

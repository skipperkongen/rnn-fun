    "I",
    "Is the total black, being spoken",
    "From the earth's inside.",
    "There are many kinds of open.",
    "How a diamond comes into a knot of flame",
    "How a sound comes into a word, coloured",
    "By who pays what for speaking.",
    "Some words are open",
    "Like a diamond on glass windows",
    "Singing out within the crash of passing sun",
    "Then there are words like stapled wagers",
    "In a perforated book\u2014buy and sign and tear apart\u2014",
    "And come whatever wills all chances",
    "The stub remains",
    "An ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge.",
    "Some words live in my throat",
    "Breeding like adders. Others know sun",
    "Seeking like gypsies over my tongue",
    "To explode through my lips",
    "Like young sparrows bursting from shell.",
    "Some words",
    "Bedevil me.",
    "Love is a word another kind of open\u2014",
    "As a diamond comes into a knot of flame",
    "I am black because I come from the earth's inside",
    "Take my word for jewel in your open light."

    "The edge of our bed was a wide grid",
    "where your fifteen-year-old daughter was hanging",
    "gut-sprung on police wheels",
    "a cablegram nailed to the wood",
    "next to a map of the Western Reserve",
    "I could not return with you to bury the body",
    "reconstruct your nightly cardboards",
    "against the seeping Transvaal cold",
    "I could not plant the other limpet mine",
    "against a wall at the railroad station",
    "nor carry either of your souls back from the river",
    "in a calabash upon my head",
    "so I bought you a ticket to Durban",
    "on my American Express",
    "and we lay together",
    "in the first light of a new season.",
    "Now clearing roughage from my autumn garden",
    "cow sorrel overgrown rocket gone to seed",
    "I reach for the taste of today",
    "the",
    "finally mentions your country",
    "a half-page story",
    "of the first white south african killed in the \u201cunrest\u201d",
    "Not of Black children massacred at Sebokeng",
    "six-year-olds imprisoned for threatening the state",
    "not of Thabo Sibeko, first grader, in his own blood",
    "on his grandmother\u2019s parlor floor",
    "Joyce, nine, trying to crawl to him",
    "shitting through her navel",
    "not of a three-week-old infant, nameless",
    "lost under the burned beds of Tembisa",
    "my hand comes down like a brown vise over the marigolds",
    "reckless through despair",
    "we were two Black women touching our flame",
    "and we left our dead behind us",
    "I hovered you rose the last ritual of healing",
    "\u201cIt is spring,\u201d you whispered",
    "\u201cI sold the ticket for guns and sulfa",
    "I leave for home tomorrow\u201d",
    "and wherever I touch you",
    "I lick cold from my fingers",
    "taste rage",
    "like salt from the lips of a woman",
    "who has killed too often to forget",
    "and carries each death in her eyes",
    "your mouth a parting orchid",
    "\u201cSomeday you will come to",

    "and we will fight side by side?\u201d",
    "Keys jingle in the door ajar threatening",
    "whatever is coming belongs here",
    "I reach for your sweetness",
    "but silence explodes like a pregnant belly",
    "into my face",

    "dresses again for war",
    "knowing the men will follow.",
    "In the intricate Maseru twilights",
    "quick sad vital",
    "she maps the next day\u2019s battle",
    "dreams of Durban sometimes",
    "visions the deep wry song of beach pebbles",
    "running after the sea."

    "Carpenters whose wives have run off",
    "Are sometimes discovered weeping on the job.",
    "But even then they don\u2019t complain of their work.",
    "Whitman\u2019s father was a carpenter.",
    "He was so happy hammering houses",
    "That he jumped with a shout from the roof beam",
    "And rolled with a yawp in the timothy.",
    "This led his son to conclude wrongly",
    "That all workmen are singers.",
    "Whitman\u2019s father was weak.",
    "He had trouble holding a job.",
    "He hoped that the house he was working on",
    "Would be lived in by a man more steady",
    "Than he was, who would earn his sleep,",
    "Dreaming easy under a sound roof",
    "With no rain in his face.",
    "Of course, there are bad carpenters everywhere.",
    "They don\u2019t care if the walls don\u2019t meet.",
    "\u201cAfter all,\u201d they argue,",
    "\u201cWe\u2019re not building airplanes.\u201d",
    "But Whitman\u2019s father measured his nails.",
    "Many mornings, clacking his plane,",
    "He crooned a song to the corners,",
    "Urging them on to a snug fit.",
    "No needles of heat will escape through a crack",
    "If he can help it, no threads of light."

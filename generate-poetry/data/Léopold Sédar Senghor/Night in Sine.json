    "Woman, place your soothing hands upon my brow,",
    "Your hands softer than fur.",
    "Above us balance the palm trees, barely rustling",
    "In the night breeze. Not even a lullaby.",
    "Let the rhythmic silence cradle us.",
    "Listen to its song. Hear the beat of our dark blood,",
    "Hear the deep pulse of Africa in the mist of lost villages.",
    "Now sets the weary moon upon its slack seabed",
    "Now the bursts of laughter quiet down, and even the storyteller",
    "Nods his head like a child on his mother\u2019s back",
    "The dancers\u2019 feet grow heavy, and heavy, too,",
    "Come the alternating voices of singers.",
    "Now the stars appear and the Night dreams",
    "Leaning on that hill of clouds, dressed in its long, milky pagne.",
    "The roofs of the huts shine tenderly. What are they saying",
    "So secretly to the stars? Inside, the fire dies out",
    "In the closeness of sour and sweet smells.",
    "Woman, light the clear-oil lamp. Let the Ancestors",
    "Speak around us as parents do when the children are in bed.",
    "Let us listen to the voices of the Elissa Elders. Exiled like us",
    "They did not want to die, or lose the flow of their semen in the sands.",
    "Let me hear, a gleam of friendly souls visits the smoke-filled hut,",
    "My head upon your breast as warm as tasty",
    "streaming from the fire,",
    "Let me breathe the odor of our Dead, let me gather",
    "And speak with their living voices, let me learn to live",
    "Before plunging deeper than the diver",
    "Into the great depths of sleep."

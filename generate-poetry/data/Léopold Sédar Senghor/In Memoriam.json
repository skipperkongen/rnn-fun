    "Today is Sunday.",
    "I fear the crowd of my fellows with such faces of stone.",
    "From my glass tower filled with headaches and impatient Ancestors,",
    "I contemplate the roofs and hilltops in the mist.",
    "In the stillness\u2014somber, naked chimneys.",
    "Below them my dead are asleep and my dreams turn to ashes.",
    "All my dreams, blood running freely down the streets",
    "And mixing with blood from the butcher shops.",
    "From this observatory like the outskirts of town",
    "I contemplate my dreams lost along the streets,",
    "Crouched at the foot of the hills like the guides of my race",
    "On the rivers of the Gambia and the Saloum",
    "And now on the Seine at the foot of these hills.",
    "Let me remember my dead!",
    "Yesterday was All Saints\u2019 Day, the solemn anniversary of the Sun,",
    "And I had no dead to honor in any cemetery.",
    "O Forefathers! You who have always refused to die,",
    "Who knew how to resist Death from the Sine to the Seine,",
    "And now in the fragile veins of my indomitable blood,",
    "Guard my dreams as you did your thin-legged migrant sons!",
    "O Ancestors! Defend the roofs of Paris in this dominical fog,",
    "The roofs that protect my dead.",
    "Let me leave this tower so dangerously secure",
    "And descend to the streets, joining my brothers",
    "Who have blue eyes and hard hands."

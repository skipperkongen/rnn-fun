    "This Luxembourg morning, this Luxembourg autumn,",
    "As I walk back and forth upon my youth,",
    "No strollers, no fountains, no boats in the water,",
    "No children, no flowers.",
    "Ah! September flowers and the sunburnt shouts of children",
    "Defying the coming winter.",
    "Now only two old fellows trying to play tennis.",
    "This autumn morning without children\u2014the children\u2019s theater closed!",
    "This Luxembourg where I no longer find my youth,",
    "The years as fresh as cut grass.",
    "Comrades, my dreams are vanquished in despair, are they not?",
    "Here they fall like leaves with other leaves,",
    "Older, mortally wounded, trampled, bitter with blood,",
    "Gathered together for what common grave?",
    "I no longer know this Luxembourg, those soldiers at attention.",
    "They set up cannons to protect the Senators\u2019 aimless retirement",
    "They dig trenches under the bench where I learned about",
    "The sweet budding of lips.",
    "This sign, ah! yes, of dangerous youth! . . .",
    "I watch the leaves fall into these false shelters, into graves",
    "Into trenches where the blood of an entire generation flows",
    "Europe is burying the nations\u2019 leaven",
    "And the hope of new races."

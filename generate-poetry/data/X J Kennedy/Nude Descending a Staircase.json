    "Toe after toe, a snowing flesh,",
    "a gold of lemon, root and rind,",
    "she sifts in sunlight down the stairs",
    "with nothing on. Nor on her mind.",
    "We spy beneath the banister",
    "a constant thresh of thigh on thigh;",
    "her lips imprint the swinging air",
    "that parts to let her parts go by.",
    "One-woman waterfall, she wears",
    "her slow descent like a long cape",
    "and pausing on the final stair,",
    "collects her motions into shape."

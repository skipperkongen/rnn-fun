    "This night nurse is different.",

    "She thinks I am sleeping.",
    "I have just barely opened my left eye,",
    "am looking through the slightest slit,",
    "as moonlight exposes the room",
    "for what it really is \u2014 a collection",
    "of surfaces; lines and planes, mostly.",
    "The night nurse puts a foot up on the radiator",
    "and braces her clipboard on her knee",
    "as she appears to take down a few notes.",
    "I imagine she is working on a sonnet,",
    "and that her ankle looks like polished walnut.",
    "You imagine she is working on a crossword,",
    "and that her feet are killing her.",
    "The slightest slit is like an old gate",
    "at a Japanese tea garden at night,",
    "in the rain, that is supposed to be closed,",
    "that is supposed to be locked.",
    "\u201cSomeone has locked up poorly,\u201d you\u2019d say.",
    "\u201cIncorrectly.\u201d But no one has asked you."

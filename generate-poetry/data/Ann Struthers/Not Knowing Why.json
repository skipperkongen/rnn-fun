    "Adolescent white pelicans squawk, rustle, flap their wings,",
    "lift off in a ragged spiral at imaginary danger.",
    "What danger on this island in the middle",
    "of Marble Lake? They\u2019re off to feel",
    "the lift of wind under their iridescent wings,",
    "because they were born to fly,",
    "because they have nothing else to do,",
    "because wind and water are their elements,",
    "their Bach, their Homer, Shakespeare,",
    "and Spielberg. They wheel over the lake,",
    "the little farms, the tourist village with their camera eyes.",
    "In autumn something urges",
    "them toward Texas marshes. They follow",
    "their appetites and instincts, unlike the small beetles",
    "creeping along geometric roads, going toward small boxes,",
    "toward lives as narrow or as wide as the pond,",
    "as glistening or as gray as the sky.",
    "They do not know why. They fly, they fly."

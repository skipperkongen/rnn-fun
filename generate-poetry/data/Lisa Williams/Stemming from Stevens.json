    "\u2014 as if vernal fluidities",
    "could be enough for the stern assault of fact.",
    "As if a living ornament,",
    "light and subject to temporal breezes,",
    "could be enough to overcome despair,",
    "that chunk of something solid in the air,",
    "unmoving, as words repeated are.",
    "It\u2019s not enough to cover despair",
    "with motion. Motion itself is flawed,",
    "continuous motion a narrow, thin escape",
    "from what is rooted. Leaves do sway,",
    "but in truth, they\u2019re only flapping out,",
    "ancillary, uncertain, buffeted",
    "this way and that. They remain the fact",
    "they are bound to, involuntary notions",
    "victim to the weather of a day,",
    "gripped by what has thrust between the rocks,",
    "flexible as everything not rock is,",
    "reckless as imagining is reckless."

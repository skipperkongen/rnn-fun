    "The image that haunts me is not beautiful.",
    "I do not think it will open into a field",
    "of wildflowers; I doubt that it will take",
    "wing suddenly, startling us into admiration.",
    "It is one of those brutish facts of life,",
    "the awkward nakedness of the memory when",
    "it takes off its clothes and crawls",
    "between the top and bottom sheet. Or rather,",
    "It is my mother\u2019s memory that I carry,",
    "pressed into my own: how at her grandfather\u2019s",
    "funeral, his daughter\u2014my mother\u2019s mother\u2014",
    "stood at an open door and cried, and then",
    "The blood ran down her legs, gushing from",
    "the womb where thirteen children had nestled,",
    "and now, at once horrified and at ease with her",
    "body\u2019s impropriety, they gathered all around.",
    "This was the grandmother who lost three of those",
    "thirteen, who hung a million baskets of wash,",
    "who peeled a million potatoes, and splattered",
    "her arms with the grease of constant cooking.",
    "This was my grandmother who kept chickens,",
    "who left her voice in the throats of all my aunts,",
    "and was struck down in the cellar, legs twisted",
    "beneath the fall and half her face stiffened.",
    "Helpless until they found her, the jar",
    "of canned fruit smashed on the cement.",
    "And then at her funeral, I saw my mother\u2019s",
    "tears, gliding ahead of me in a black limousine,",
    "a procession not beautiful but haunting."

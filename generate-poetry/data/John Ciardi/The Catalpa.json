    "The catalpa\u2019s white week is ending there",
    "in its corner of my yard. It has its arms full",
    "of its own flowering now, but the least air",
    "spills off a petal and a breeze lets fall",
    "whole coronations. There is not much more",
    "of what this is. Is every gladness quick?",
    "That tree\u2019s a nuisance, really. Long before",
    "the summer\u2019s out, its beans, long as a stick,",
    "will start to shed. And every year one limb",
    "cracks without falling off and hangs there dead",
    "till I get up and risk my neck to trim",
    "what it knows how to lose but not to shed.",
    "I keep it only for this one white pass.",
    "The end of June\u2019s its garden; July, its Fall;",
    "all else, the world remembering what it was",
    "in the seven days of its visible miracle.",
    "What should I keep if averages were all?"

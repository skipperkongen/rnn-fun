    "Most like an arch\u2014an entrance which upholds",
    "and shores the stone-crush up the air like lace.",
    "Mass made idea, and idea held in place.",
    "A lock in time. Inside half-heaven unfolds.",
    "Most like an arch\u2014two weaknesses that lean",
    "into a strength. Two fallings become firm.",
    "Two joined abeyances become a term",
    "naming the fact that teaches fact to mean.",
    "Not quite that? Not much less. World as it is,",
    "what\u2019s strong and separate falters. All I do",
    "at piling stone on stone apart from you",
    "is roofless around nothing. Till we kiss",
    "I am no more than upright and unset.",
    "It is by falling in and in we make",
    "the all-bearing point, for one another\u2019s sake,",
    "in faultless failing, raised by our own weight."

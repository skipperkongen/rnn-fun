    "The morning that the world began",
    "The Lion growled a growl at Man.",
    "And I suspect the Lion might",
    "(If he\u2019d been closer) have tried a bite.",
    "I think that\u2019s as it ought to be",
    "And not as it was taught to me.",
    "I think the Lion has a right",
    "To growl a growl and bite a bite.",
    "And if the Lion bothered Adam,",
    "He should have growled right back at \u2019im.",
    "The way to treat a Lion right",
    "Is growl for growl and bite for bite.",
    "True, the Lion is better fit",
    "For biting than for being bit.",
    "But if you look him in the eye",
    "You\u2019ll find the Lion\u2019s rather shy.",
    "He really wants someone to pet him.",
    "The trouble is: his teeth won\u2019t let him.",
    "He has a heart of gold beneath",
    "But the Lion just can\u2019t trust his teeth."

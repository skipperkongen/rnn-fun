    "They are not angels",
    "though they have the hollow look",
    "of beings bred on ether. There\u2019s an air",
    "of cool removal from your life, the hawk\u2019s",
    "indifference to the hare\u2019s terror.",
    "You see it in their palms, raised casually",
    "against the fresco\u2019s surface, as to glass",
    "of submarine or spacecraft, and you see",
    "it in their eyes, oracular, that let you pass",
    "alone to unknown agony. The song",
    "they sing is merely time."

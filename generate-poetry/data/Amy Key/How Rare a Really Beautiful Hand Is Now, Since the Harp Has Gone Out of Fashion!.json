    "Moisturizer is important to me like a car is important.",
    "I\u2019ll never own a car and skin is incidentally mine.",
    "Truth is, skin seems to manage pretty well on its own.",
    "I only travel in cars to sing to the radio.",
    "My skin is such a brute! It needs a regime!",
    "I need a drink. My car and my skin need a drink. I want to say",
    ". My skin is so dull",
    "and I have no car. My eyes, however, are ritzy.",
    "I favor the non-abrasive. My cult product",
    "is an anti-aging self-emollient. More often",
    "this is new pajamas. But pajamas need multi-talents!",
    "I\u2019m not yet old-old. Thinking of crystal decanters",
    "makes me feel young, they are inscrutable adulthood.",
    "My skin can\u2019t be so bad \u2014 sleep is like a drink",
    "and my controls are set to bed. This is my mitigation",
    "against stress, stern weather, assorted irritations.",
    "Being ravaged is my own fault! Proper living",
    "requires routine, tiny adjustments that make life better.",
    "I\u2019m making plans with no muscle to them.",
    "Sleep is no artificial skin, despite its gauzy potential.",
    "Rose water \u2014 by the by I\u2019d rather drink it",
    "as the hokey pendulum swings.",
    "I\u2019m looking for something foolproof, aplomb",
    "that withstands the interrogating nude."

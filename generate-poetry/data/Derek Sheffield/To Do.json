    "an ivory-billed, that one they say",
    "(if that\u2019s what they saw) is the last,",
    "epic of the land, boomerang to be",

    "Again. And again you\u2019re just beginning:",
    "a nest of electric light, a boy",
    "waiting for the bus and laughing",
    "at the cartoon bird laughing like crazy."

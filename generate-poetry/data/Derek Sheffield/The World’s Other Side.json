    "In Japan, when you die, they wheel",
    "what\u2019s left of you out of the incinerator,",
    "and what\u2019s left of your family takes turns",
    "picking with special chopsticks.",
    "It looks like they have gathered to dine",
    "over a dead campfire, but they are not,",
    "of course, eating you. They are feeding you",
    "to the round mouth of an urn:",
    "only in pieces, Father, to the fire.",
    "In their bright swimsuits,",
    "my daughters spill warm sand over my skin",
    "as I lie still, watching the sun",
    "needle the sky. The baby licks her fingers",
    "to tell, perhaps, if I am ready, her bald head",
    "white with lotion, her mouth full",
    "of vowels. The older one says nothing",
    "above the ocean\u2019s slow rush,",
    "but scoops and pats to get me done",
    "and gone. I\u2019ve never been to Japan,",
    "but once, a globe of glass",
    "found me at the clear end of a wave.",
    "It drifted from the other side, my mother said.",
    "Cold and slick, it glistened as I held it up",
    "with both hands and looked through",
    "to the green flames of the sun",
    "before tasting the salt with my tongue."

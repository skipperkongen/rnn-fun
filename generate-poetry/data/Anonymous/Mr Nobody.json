    "I know a funny little man,",

    "Who leaves the door ajar,",
    "He pulls the buttons from our shirts,",
    "And scatters pins afar;",

    "To let the curtains fade.",
    "The ink we never spill; the boots",
    "That lying round you see",
    "Are not our boots,\u2014they all belong",
    "To Mr. Nobody."

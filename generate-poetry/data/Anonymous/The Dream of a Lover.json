    "Benedicite! whate dreamed I this nyght?",
    "Methought the worlde was turnyd up so downe",
    "The sun, the moone had lost their force and lyght,",
    "The sea also drowned both toure and towne.",
    "Yet more marvel how that I heard the sounde",
    "Of onys voice saying: beare in thy mynd,",
    "Thi lady hath forgotten to be kynd."

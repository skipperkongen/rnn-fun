    "Love me little, love me long,",
    "Is the burden of my song.",
    "Love that is too hot and strong",
    "Burneth soon to waste:",
    "Still, I would not have thee cold,",
    "Not too backward, nor too bold;",
    "Love that lasteth till \u2019tis old",
    "Fadeth not in haste.",
    "Love me little, love me long,",
    "Is the burden of my song.",
    "If thou lovest me too much",
    "It will not prove as true as touch;",
    "Love me little, more than such,",
    "For I fear the end:",
    "I am with little well content,",
    "And a little from thee sent",
    "Is enough, with true intent",
    "To be steadfast friend.",
    "Love me little, love me long,",
    "Is the burden of my song.",
    "Say thou lov\u2019st me while thou live;",
    "I to thee my love will give,",
    "never dreaming to deceive",
    "Whiles that life endures:",
    "Nay, and after death, in sooth,",
    "I too thee will keep my truth,",
    "As now, when in my May of youth:",
    "This my love assures.",
    "Love me little, love me long,",
    "Is the burden on my song.",
    "Constant love is moderate ever,",
    "And it will through life pers\u00e8ver:",
    "Give me that, with true endeavour",
    "I will it restore.",
    "A suit of durance let it be",
    "For all weathers that for me,",
    "For the land or for the sea,",
    "Lasting evermore.",
    "Love me little, love me long,",
    "Is the burden of my song.",
    "Winter\u2019s cold, or summer\u2019s heat,",
    "Autumn\u2019s tempests, on it beat,",
    "It can never know defeat,",
    "Never can rebel:",
    "Such the love that I would gain,",
    "Such the love, I tell thee plain,",
    "Thou must give, or woo in vain:",
    "So to thee, farewell",
    "Love me little, love me long,",
    "Is the burden of my song."

    "My pa he didn\u2019t go to town",
    "Last evening after tea,",
    "But got a book and settled down",
    "As comfy as could be.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you I was offul glad",
    "To have my pa about",
    "To answer all the things I had",
    "Been tryin\u2019 to find out.",
    "And so I asked him why the world",
    "Is round instead of square,",
    "And why the piggies\u2019 tails are curled,",
    "And why don\u2019t fish breathe air?",
    "And why the moon don\u2019t hit a star,",
    "And why the dark is black,",
    "And just how many birds there are,",
    "And will the wind come back?",
    "And why does water stay in wells,",
    "And why do June bugs hum,",
    "And what\u2019s the roar I hear in shells,",
    "And when will Christmas come?",
    "And why the grass is always green,",
    "Instead of sometimes blue,",
    "And why a bean will grow a bean",
    "And not an apple, too?",
    "And why a horse can\u2019t learn to moo,",
    "And why a cow can\u2019t neigh?",
    "And do the fairies live on dew,",
    "And what makes hair grow gray\u2014",
    "And then my pa got up an\u2019 gee!",
    "The offul words he said,",
    "I hadn\u2019t done a things, but he",
    "Jest sent me off to bed."

    "he\u2019s only a smart-ass when he\u2019s home",
    "with Mandrake",
    "he\u2019s silent and obedient as a snail",
    "his bald pate bowing into the cape\u2019s",
    "trail and dreaming",
    "of tales he\u2019ll bore me with",
    "his one night home",
    "once a month",
    "that\u2019s what I get like clockwork",
    "and always on the full moon",
    "half my allowance he reserves",
    "for sheets, tearing them with his teeth",
    "to vent the forced silence",
    "of those other twenty-odd days",
    "did I say odd",
    "it\u2019s that one day that\u2019s odd",
    "his coming home full of half-tricks",
    "he\u2019s picked up from the master",
    "the hypnotic hunger",
    "he so willingly tries on me",
    "he claims he stole me, bought me",
    "claims he\u2019s Zulu, Bantu, Beja",
    "depending on the hour, day, or year",
    "says I was the black spot",
    "in the white of his eye",
    "the speck he turned into leopard",
    "that unwittingly turned into woman",
    "neither of us no longer knows what\u2019s real",
    "and my mother beats her fat tongue",
    "against her gums",
    "as each month I try to reveal the puzzle",
    "stroking the lines from his hairless",
    "obsidian crown",
    "I hear her rumbling around in the next room",
    "I soothe his sweet head and she moans",
    "heaven protect us from all the things",
    "to which we can become accustomed"

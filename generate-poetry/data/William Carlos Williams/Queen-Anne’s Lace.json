    "Her body is not so white as",
    "anemony petals nor so smooth\u2014nor",
    "so remote a thing. It is a field",
    "of the wild carrot taking",
    "the field by force; the grass",
    "does not raise above it.",
    "Here is no question of whiteness,",
    "white as can be, with a purple mole",
    "at the center of each flower.",
    "Each flower is a hand\u2019s span",
    "of her whiteness. Wherever",
    "his hand has lain there is",
    "a tiny purple blemish. Each part",
    "is a blossom under his touch",
    "to which the fibres of her being",
    "stem one by one, each to its end,",
    "until the whole field is a",
    "white desire, empty, a single stem,",
    "a cluster, flower by flower,",
    "a pious wish to whiteness gone over\u2014",
    "or nothing."

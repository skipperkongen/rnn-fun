    "Now that I have cooled to you",
    "Let there be gold of tarnished masonry,",
    "Temples soothed by the sun to ruin",
    "That sleep utterly.",
    "Give me hand for the dances,",
    "Ripples at Philae, in and out,",
    "And lips, my Lesbian,",
    "Wall flowers that once were flame.",
    "Your hair is my Carthage",
    "And my arms the bow,",
    "And our words arrows",
    "To shoot the stars",
    "Who from that misty sea",
    "Swarm to destroy us.",
    "But you there beside me\u2014",
    "Oh how shall I defy you,",
    "Who wound me in the night",
    "With breasts shining",
    "Like Venus and like Mars?",
    "The night that is shouting Jason",
    "When the loud eaves rattle",
    "As with waves above me",
    "Blue at the prow of my desire."

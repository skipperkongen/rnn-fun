    "I will teach you my townspeople",
    "how to perform a funeral \u2014",
    "for you have it over a troop",
    "of artists\u2014",
    "unless one should scour the world \u2014",
    "you have the ground sense necessary.",
    "See! the hearse leads.",
    "I begin with a design for a hearse.",
    "For Christ's sake not black \u2014",
    "nor white either \u2014 and not polished!",
    "Let it be weathered \u2014 like a farm wagon \u2014",
    "with gilt wheels (this could be",
    "applied fresh at small expense)",
    "or no wheels at all:",
    "a rough dray to drag over the ground.",
    "Knock the glass out!",
    "My God-glass, my townspeople!",
    "For what purpose? Is it for the dead",
    "to look out or for us to see",
    "how well he is housed or to see",
    "the flowers or the lack of them \u2014",
    "or what?",
    "To keep the rain and snow from him?",
    "He will have a heavier rain soon:",
    "pebbles and dirt and what not.",
    "Let there be no glass \u2014",
    "and no upholstery phew!",
    "and no little brass rollers",
    "and small easy wheels on the bottom \u2014",
    "my townspeople what are you thinking of?",
    "A rough plain hearse then",
    "with gilt wheels and no top at all.",
    "On this the coffin lies",
    "by its own weight.",
    "No wreathes please \u2014",
    "especially no hot house flowers.",
    "Some common memento is better,",
    "something he prized and is known by:",
    "his old clothes \u2014 a few books perhaps \u2014",
    "God knows what! You realize",
    "how we are about these things",
    "my townspeople \u2014",
    "something will be found \u2014 anything",
    "even flowers if he had come to that.",
    "So much for the hearse.",
    "For heaven's sake though see to the driver!",
    "Take off the silk hat! In fact",
    "that's no place at all for him \u2014",
    "up there unceremoniously",
    "dragging our friend out to his own dignity!",
    "Bring him down \u2014 bring him down!",
    "Low and inconspicuous! I'd not have him ride",
    "on the wagon at all \u2014 damn him \u2014",
    "the undertaker's understrapper!",
    "Let him hold the reins",
    "and walk at the side",
    "and inconspicuously too!",
    "Then briefly as to yourselves:",
    "Walk behind \u2014 as they do in France,",
    "seventh class, or if you ride",
    "Hell take curtains! Go with some show",
    "of inconvenience; sit openly \u2014",
    "to the weather as to grief.",
    "Or do you think you can shut grief in?",
    "What \u2014 from us? We who have perhaps",
    "nothing to lose? Share with us",
    "share with us \u2014 it will be money",
    "in your pockets.",
    "Go now",
    "I think you are ready."

    "clearer, I spied the binary in the handle",
    "of the Big Dipper dangling above my shoulder,",
    "a pinprick twinkling by a blinding candle.",
    "Absent the moon, its boreal corona,",
    "I watched the stars rise east of Ellendale,",
    "Guelph and Ludden, then wheel above Verona",
    "and sleeping friends who farm near Englevale.",
    "A thousand miles of road: I\u2019d shunned the pavement",
    "which bears the burdens I no longer ferry,",
    "the cargo of material enslavement.",
    "Six eagles hunted small game on the prairie.",
    "An Arab prince\u2019s fortunes once were measured",
    "by blooded foals, by sons his wives could dandle,",
    "by tributary quatrains to be treasured",
    "and his eyesight: a pinprick by a candle."

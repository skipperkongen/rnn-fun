    "the disembodiment that looms so near.",
    "Detachment? So an ice cliff by the sea",
    "calves with a seismic crash",
    "of bergy bits and brash,",
    "choking a waterway with its debris.",
    "We clear the neap tide beach of glacial wrack,",
    "pace and mark the ground,",
    "then wave the Cessna round.",
    "Pilot, we bank on you to bear us back."

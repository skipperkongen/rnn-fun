    "Then the cicadas again like kindling that won\u2019t take.",
    "The struck match of some utopia we no longer remember",
    "the terms of\u2014",
    "the rules. What was it was going to be abolished, what",
    "restored? Behind them the foghorn in the harbor,",
    "the hoarse announcements of unhurried arrivals,",
    "the spidery virgin-shrieks of gulls, a sideways sound, a slippery",
    "utterly ash-free",
    "delinquency",
    "and then the subaqueous pasturings inexhaustible",
    "phosphorous handwritings the frothings of their own excitements now",
    "erase, depth wrestling with the current-corridors of depth ...",
    "But here, up on the hill, in town,",
    "the clusterings of dwellings in balconied crystal-formation,",
    "the cadaverous swallowings of the dream of reason gone,",
    "hot fingerprints where thoughts laid out these streets, these braceletings",
    "of park and government\u2014a hospital\u2014a dirt-bike run\u2014",
    "here, we stand in our hysteria with our hands in our pockets,",
    "quiet, at the end of day, looking out, theories stationary,",
    "while the freight, the crazy wick, once more slides down\u2014",
    "marionette-like its being lowered in\u2014",
    "marionette-strung our outwaiting its bloody translation ...",
    "Utopia: remember the sensation of",
    "we loved,",
    "how it tunneled forwardly for us,",
    "and us so feudal in its wake\u2014",
    "speckling of diamond-dust as I think of it now,",
    "that being carried forward by the notion of human",
    "perfectibility\u2014like a pasture imposed",
    "on the rising vibrancy of endless diamond-dust ...",
    "And how we would comply, some day. How we were",
    "to fit and",
    "comply\u2014",
    "as handwriting fits to the form of its passion,",
    "no, to the form of its passionate bearer\u2019s fingerprintable i.d.,",
    "or, no, to the handkerchief she brings now to her haunted face,",
    "lifting the sunglasses to wipe away",
    "the theory\u2014or is it the tears?\u2014the freight now all",
    "in her right hand, in the oceanic place we\u2019d pull up",
    "through her wrist\u2014we\u2019d siphon right up\u2014",
    "marionette with her leavening of mother-of-pearl\u2014",
    "how she wants to be legible, how the light streaking her shades now",
    "which she would",
    "of course, because that, she has heard,",
    "from the rumorous diamond-dust, is what is required,",
    "as also her spirit\u2014now that it has been swallowed",
    "like a lustrous hailstone by her unquenchable body\u2014suggests\u2014the zero",
    "at the heart of the christened bonfire\u2014oh little grimace, kiss, solo",
    "at the heart\u2014growing refined, tiny missionary, in your brightskirted",
    "host,",
    "scorched comprehension\u2014because that",
    "what\u2019s required,",
    "her",
    "now the sunset onto that page,",
    "as an expression of her deepest undertowing sentiment,",
    "which spidery gestures, tongued-over the molecular whiteness,",
    "squared out and stretched and made to resemble emptiness,",
    "will take down the smoldering in the terms of her passion",
    "\u2014sunglasses on the table, telephone ringing\u2014",
    "and be carried across the tongue-tied ocean,",
    "through dusk, right through it, over prisons, over tiny clapboard houses",
    "to which the bartender returns, exhausted, after work,",
    "over flare-ups of civil strife, skeletons rotting in the arms of",
    "skeletons, the foliage all round them gleaming,",
    "the green belly-up god we thought we\u2019d seen the last of,",
    "shuddering his sleep off, first fruit hanging ripe\u2014oh bright red zero\u2014",
    "right there within reach, that he too may be nourished,",
    "you know this of course, what has awakened which we thought we\u2019d",
    "extinguished,",
    "us still standing here sword in hand, hand extended,",
    "frail, over the limpid surface of the lake-like page,",
    "the sleep-like page, now folded and gently driven into",
    "its envelope, for the tiny journey, over offices, over sacrifices,",
    "to its particular address, at the heart of the metropolis,",
    "where someone else is waiting, hailstone at the core,",
    "and the heat is too great, friend, the passion in its envelope,",
    "doors slamming, traffic backing-up, the populace not really",
    "abandoned, not really, just very tired on its long red errancy",
    "down the freeways in the dusklight",
    "towards the little town on the hill\u2014the",
    "\u2014",
    "how long ago was it we said that? do you remember?\u2014",
    "and now that you\u2019ve remembered\u2014and the distance we\u2019ve",

    "how little we\u2019ve found\u2014aren\u2019t we tired? aren\u2019t we",
    "going to close the elaborate folder",
    "which holds the papers in their cocoon of possibility,",
    "the folder so pretty with its massive rose-blooms,",
    "oh perpetual bloom, dread fatigue, and drowsiness like leavening I",

    "Late in the season the world digs in, the fat blossoms",
    "hold still for just a moment longer.",
    "Nothing looks satisfied,",
    "but there is no real reason to move on much further:",
    "this isn\u2019t a bad place;",
    "why not pretend",
    "we wished for it?",
    "The bushes have learned to live with their haunches.",
    "The hydrangea is resigned",
    "to its pale and inconclusive utterances.",
    "Towards the end of the season",
    "it is not bad",
    "to have the body. To have experienced joy",
    "as the mere lifting of hunger",
    "is not to have known it",
    "less. The tobacco leaves",
    "don\u2019t mind being removed",
    "to the long racks\u2014all uses are astounding",
    "to the used.",
    "There are moments in our lives which, threaded, give us heaven\u2014",
    "noon, for instance, or all the single victories",
    "of gravity, or the kudzu vine,",
    "most delicate of manias,",
    "which has pressed its luck",
    "this far this season.",
    "It shines a gloating green.",
    "Its edges darken with impatience, a kind of wind.",
    "Nothing again will ever be this easy, lives",
    "being snatched up like dropped stitches, the dry stalks of daylilies",
    "marking a stillness we can\u2019t keep."

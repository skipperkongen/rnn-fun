    "All this was written on the next day\u2019s list.",
    "On which the busyness unfurled its cursive roots,",
    "pale but effective,",
    "and the long stern of the necessary, the",
    "built-up its tiniest cathedral ...",
    "(Or is it the sum of what",
    ")",
    "If I lean down, to whisper, to them,",
    "down into their gravitational field, there where they head busily on",
    "into the woods, laying the gifts out one by one, onto the path,",
    "hoping to be",
    "hoping to please the children\u2014",
    "(and some gifts overwrapped and some not wrapped at all)\u2014if",
    "I stir the wintered ground-leaves",
    "up from the paths, nimbly, into a sheet of sun,",
    "into an escape-route-width of sun, mildly gelatinous where wet, though",
    "mostly crisp,",
    "fluffing them up a bit, and up, as if to choke the singularity of sun",
    "with this jubilation of manyness, all through and round these passers-by\u2014",
    "just leaves, nothing that can vaporize into a thought,",
    "no, a burning-bush\u2019s worth of spidery, up-ratcheting, tender-cling leaves,",
    "oh if\u2014the list gripped hard by the left hand of one,",
    "the busyness buried so deep into the puffed-up greenish mind of one,",
    "the hurried mind hovering over its rankings,",
    "the heart\u2014there at the core of the drafting leaves\u2014wet and warm at the",
    "zero of",
    "the bright mock-stairwaying-up of the posthumous leaves\u2014the heart,",
    "formulating its alleyways of discovery,",
    "fussing about",
    "the heart trying to make time and place seem small,",
    "sliding its slim tears into the deep wallet of each new event",
    "on the list",
    "then checking it off\u2014oh the satisfaction\u2014each check a small kiss,",
    "an echo of the previous one, off off it goes the dry high-ceilinged",
    "obligation,",
    "checked-off by the fingertips, by the small gust called",
    "that swipes",
    "the unfinishable\u2019s gold hem aside, revealing",
    "what might have been, peeling away what should ...",
    "There are flowerpots at their feet.",
    "There is fortune-telling in the air they breathe.",
    "It filters in with its flashlight-beam, its holy-water-tinted air,",
    "down into the open eyes, the lampblack open mouth.",
    "Oh listen to these words I\u2019m spitting out for you.",
    "My distance from you makes them louder.",
    "Are we",
    "waiting for the phone to ring?",
    "Who should it be? What fountain is expected to",
    "thrash forth mysteries of morning joy? What quail-like giant tail of",
    "promises, pleiades, psalters, plane-trees,",
    "what parapets petalling-forth the invisible",
    "into the",
    "turning the list into its spatial form at last,",
    "into its archival many-headed, many-legged colony....",
    "Oh look at you.",
    "What is it you hold back? What piece of time is it the list",
    "won\u2019t cover? You down there, in the theater of",
    "operations\u2014you, throat of the world\u2014so diacritical\u2014",
    "(are we all waiting for the phone to ring?)\u2014",
    "(what will you say? are you home? are you expected soon?)\u2014",
    "oh wanderer back from break, all your attention focused",
    "\u2014as if the thinking were an oar, this ship the last of some",
    "original fleet, the captains gone but some of us",
    "who saw the plan drawn out",
    "still here\u2014who saw the thinking clot-up in the bodies of the greater men,",
    "who saw them sit in silence while the voices in the other room",
    "lit up with passion, itchings, dreams of landings,",
    "while the solitary ones,",
    "heads in their hands, so still,",
    "the idea barely forming",
    "at the base of that stillness,",
    "the idea like a homesickness starting just to fold and pleat and knot",
    "itself",
    "out of the manyness\u2014the plan\u2014before it\u2019s thought,",
    "before it\u2019s a",
    "or the name-you\u2019re-known-by\u2014",
    "the men of",
    "the outcomes of",
    "\u2014before\u2014",
    "the mind still gripped hard by the hands",
    "that would hold the skull even stiller if they could,",
    "that nothing distract, that nothing but the possible be let",
    "to filter through\u2014",
    "the possible and then the finely filamented hope, the filigree,",
    "without the distractions of wonder\u2014",
    "oh tiny golden spore just filtering in to touch the good idea,",
    "which taking-form begins to twist,",
    "coursing for bottom-footing, palpating for edge-hold, limit,",
    "now finally about to",
    "rise, about to go into the other room\u2014and yet",
    "not having done so yet, not yet\u2014the",
    "intake\u2014before the credo, before the plan\u2014",
    "right at the homesickness\u2014before this list you hold",
    "in your exhausted hand. Oh put it down."

    "And the morning\u2019s marine layer cloud cover\u2019s just beginning to unhinge,",
    "to let the buttery light of another daybreak slip through",
    "And weigh down the dead lawns and sagging rooftops",
    "of this neighborhood, where Cold War era television antennas",
    "Still cast shadows like B-52s heading offshore, where poverty, this early",
    "is the smell of Malt-O-Meal and the dregs of thin beer",
    "Washed down the sink. Where the shift begins at 7AM,",
    "but consciousness has a way of coming round as slowly",
    "As this old computer monitor flickers its dull sixteen colors into being.",
    "On it, the names and numbers of laundromat and liquor store owners,",
    "Fast food managers and lawn care companies; it\u2019s my job",
    "to cold call them, read from a script on the benefits of membership",
    "In the Executive Dining Club, not take",
    "for an answer.",
    "I\u2019m no good and both the boss and I know it, and he\u2019s hovering",
    "When the scraped-out voice of the woman on my phone answers me with",
    ", and then, instead of hanging up,",
    "Throws the receiver down next to something \u2014 dishwasher or window AC,",
    "I don\u2019t know \u2014 but something close, it sounds, to tearing itself apart,",
    "Something cycling through an awful, screeching noise.",
    "And it\u2019s because I\u2019ve paused that the boss flings a pencil",
    "Into the wall in front of me and edges closer, and because of the fear",
    "of unemployment forms or the sky opening up if I were to walk out,",
    "And because this sound \u2014 the un-oiled, flak-fouled crack of it \u2014",
    "has left me standing suddenly at the end of a runway, planes",
    "Screaming low overhead and loaded for the beginning of the end of the world,",
    "that I start back into the script, start back as if I believe each word,",
    "Even though, in the rattle and dust of the jet-wash, no one hears a thing."

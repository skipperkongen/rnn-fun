    "I strayed about the deck, an hour, to-night",
    "Under a cloudy moonless sky; and peeped",
    "In at the windows, watched my friends at table,",
    "Or playing cards, or standing in the doorway,",
    "Or coming out into the darkness. Still",
    "No one could see me.",
    "I would have thought of them",
    "\u2014Heedless, within a week of battle\u2014in pity,",
    "Pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness",
    "And link\u2019d beauty of bodies, and pity that",
    "This gay machine of splendour \u2019ld soon be broken,",
    "Thought little of, pashed, scattered. \u2026",
    "Only, always,",
    "I could but see them\u2014against the lamplight\u2014pass",
    "Like coloured shadows, thinner than filmy glass,",
    "Slight bubbles, fainter than the wave\u2019s faint light,",
    "That broke to phosphorus out in the night,",
    "Perishing things and strange ghosts\u2014soon to die",
    "To other ghosts\u2014this one, or that, or I."

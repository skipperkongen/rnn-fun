    "Mamua, when our laughter ends,",
    "And hearts and bodies, brown as white,",
    "Are dust about the doors of friends,",
    "Or scent ablowing down the night,",
    "Then, oh! then, the wise agree,",
    "Comes our immortality.",
    "Mamua, there waits a land",
    "Hard for us to understand.",
    "Out of time, beyond the sun,",
    "All are one in Paradise,",
    "You and Pupure are one,",
    "And Ta\u00fc, and the ungainly wise.",
    "There the Eternals are, and there",
    "The Good, the Lovely, and the True,",
    "And Types, whose earthly copies were",
    "The foolish broken things we knew;",
    "There is the Face, whose ghosts we are;",
    "The real, the never-setting Star;",
    "And the Flower, of which we love",
    "Faint and fading shadows here;",
    "Never a tear, but only Grief;",
    "Dance, but not the limbs that move;",
    "Songs in Song shall disappear;",
    "Instead of lovers, Love shall be;",
    "For hearts, Immutability;",
    "And there, on the Ideal Reef,",
    "Thunders the Everlasting Sea!",
    "And my laughter, and my pain,",
    "Shall home to the Eternal Brain.",
    "And all lovely things, they say,",
    "Meet in Loveliness again;",
    "Miri\u2019s laugh, Te\u00efpo\u2019s feet,",
    "And the hands of Matua,",
    "Stars and sunlight there shall meet",
    "Coral\u2019s hues and rainbows there,",
    "And Te\u00fcra\u2019s braided hair;",
    "And with the starred",
    "white,",
    "And white birds in the dark ravine,",
    "And",
    "ablaze at night,",
    "And jewels, and evening\u2019s after-green,",
    "And dawns of pearl and gold and red,",
    "Mamua, your lovelier head!",
    "And there\u2019ll no more be one who dreams",
    "Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff,",
    "Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems,",
    "All time-entangled human love.",
    "And you\u2019ll no longer swing and sway",
    "Divinely down the scented shade,",
    "Where feet to Ambulation fade,",
    "And moons are lost in endless Day.",
    "How shall we wind these wreaths of ours,",
    "Where there are neither heads nor flowers?",
    "Oh, Heaven\u2019s Heaven!\u2014but we\u2019ll be missing",
    "The palms, and sunlight, and the south;",
    "And there\u2019s an end, I think, of kissing,",
    "When our mouths are one with Mouth....",
    ", Mamua,",
    "Crown the hair, and come away!",
    "Hear the calling of the moon,",
    "And the whispering scents that stray",
    "About the idle warm lagoon.",
    "Hasten, hand in human hand,",
    "Down the dark, the flowered way,",
    "Along the whiteness of the sand,",
    "And in the water\u2019s soft caress,",
    "Wash the mind of foolishness,",
    "Mamua, until the day.",
    "Spend the glittering moonlight there",
    "Pursuing down the soundless deep",
    "Limbs that gleam and shadowy hair,",
    "Or floating lazy, half-asleep.",
    "Dive and double and follow after,",
    "Snare in flowers, and kiss, and call,",
    "With lips that fade, and human laughter",
    "And faces individual,",
    "Well this side of Paradise! ....",
    "There\u2019s little comfort in the wise."

    "If I should die, think only this of me:",
    "That there\u2019s some corner of a foreign field",
    "That is for ever England. There shall be",
    "In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;",
    "A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,",
    "Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam;",
    "A body of England\u2019s, breathing English air,",
    "Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.",
    "And think, this heart, all evil shed away,",
    "A pulse in the eternal mind, no less",
    "Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;",
    "Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;",
    "And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,",
    "In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.",
    ": This poem has had two titles: \u201cThe Soldier\u201d and \u201cNineteen-Fourteen: The Soldier\u201d. The student may give either title during the recitation."

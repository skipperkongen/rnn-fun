    "Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest",
    "He who has found our hid security,",
    "Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,",
    "And heard our word, \u2018Who is so safe as we?\u2019",
    "We have found safety with all things undying,",
    "The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,",
    "The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,",
    "And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.",
    "We have built a house that is not for Time\u2019s throwing.",
    "We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.",
    "War knows no power. Safe shall be my going,",
    "Secretly armed against all death\u2019s endeavour;",
    "Safe though all safety\u2019s lost; safe where men fall;",
    "And if these poor limbs die, safest of all."

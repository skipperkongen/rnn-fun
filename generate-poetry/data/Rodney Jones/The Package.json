    "It was a green barn coat from L. L. Bean",
    "That he had ordered, thinking of her",
    "Walking the snowy hillside of his dream",
    "Though she detested the style and color.",
    "That it arrived two days after he died",
    "Did not dispose her to detest it less",
    "Though she may have wished she did,",
    "The way she wished she\u2019d kept house",
    "More neatly or baked instead of fried,",
    "For every coronary\u2019s a latent homicide\u2014",
    "If not what we did, what we did not do.",
    "If not what we said, what we did not say.",
    "In this, the inner jury\u2019s always out,",
    "No different for man or woman\u2014",
    "For everyone over forty, the human",
    "Condition is grief complicated by guilt.",
    "It\u2019s unexceptional really, what\u2019s left",
    "After deaths. We\u2019re thrown back on our own taste.",
    "That coat, for instance. If that was a gift,",
    "She would have to hide to throw it away."

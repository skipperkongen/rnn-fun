    "Maybe a sin, indecent for sure\u2014dope,",
    "The storekeeper called it. Everyone agreed",
    "That Manuel Lawrence, who drank",
    "Through the side of his mouth, squinting",
    "And chortling with pleasure, was hooked;",
    "Furthermore, Aunt Brenda,",
    "Who was so religious that she made",
    "Her daughters bathe with their panties on,",
    "Had dubbed it \u201ctoy likker, fool thing,\u201d",
    "And so might I be, holding the bottle",
    "Out to the light, watching it bristle.",
    "Watching the slow spume of bubbles",
    "Die, I asked myself, could it be alive?",
    "When they electrocuted Edwin Dockery,",
    "He sat there like a steaming, breathing",
    "Bolt, the green muscles in his arms",
    "Strained at the chair\u2019s black straps,",
    "The little finger of his right hand leapt up,",
    "But the charge rose, the four minutes",
    "And twenty-five hundred volts of his death,",
    "Which in another month will be",
    "Thirty-five years old. So the drink fizzed",
    "With the promise of mixtures to come.",
    "There it was. If the hard-shell",
    "Baptists of Alabama are good and content",
    "That the monster has died, so am I.",
    "I swallowed. Sweet darkness, one thing",
    "Led to another, the usual life, waking",
    "Sometimes lost, dried blood in the ear,",
    "Police gabbling in a strange language.",
    "How else would I ever gauge",
    "How pleasure might end, walking",
    "Past midnight in the vague direction",
    "Of music. I am never satisfied."

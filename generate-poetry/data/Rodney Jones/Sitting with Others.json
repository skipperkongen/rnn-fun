    "The front seats filled last. Laggards, buffoons,",
    "and kiss-ups falling in beside local politicos,",
    "the about to be honored, and the hard of hearing.",
    "No help from the middle, blenders and criminals.",
    "And the back rows: restless, intelligent, unable to commit.",
    "My place was always left-center, a little to the rear.",
    "The shy sat with me, fearful of discovery.",
    "Behind me the dead man\u2019s illegitimate children",
    "and the bride\u2019s and groom\u2019s former lovers.",
    "There, when lights were lowered, hands",
    "plunged under skirts or deftly unzipped flies,",
    "and, lights up again, rose and pattered in applause.",
    "Ahead, the bored practiced impeccable signatures.",
    "But was it a movie or a singing? I remember",
    "the whole crowd uplifted, but not the event",
    "or the word that brought us together as one\u2014",
    "One, I say now, when I had felt myself many,",
    "speaking and listening: that was the contradiction."

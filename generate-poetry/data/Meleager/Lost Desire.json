    "Love brought by night a vision to my bed,",
    "One that still wore the vesture of a child",
    "But eighteen years of age \u2013 who sweetly smiled",
    "Till of the lovely form false hopes were bred",
    "And keen embraces wild.",
    "Ah! for the lost desire that haunts me yet,",
    "Till mine eyes fail in sleep that finds no more",
    "That fleeting ghost! Oh, lovelorn heart, give o\u2019er \u2013",
    "Cease thy vain dreams of beauty\u2019s warmth \u2013 forget",
    "The face thou longest for!"

    "Back from Istanbul, she gives to me",
    "the photograph she took inside",
    "the Archaeological Museum\u2019s",
    "blue tiled hush, of a tablet",
    "carved in terra cotta from Nippur,",
    "written in Sumerian.",
    "Delicate etches, a lift of riverbed",
    "where the summer waters ran",
    "glistened on this piece of earth",
    "the earnest working hand,",
    "a pause between the lines to contemplate",
    "cedars\u2019 ornate overhanging",
    "leaf-work become inseparable",
    "from the carving. Maybe reading sky,",
    "reading wind, or tree sounds",
    "beside the sound of clay",
    "shaped to carry a human mark.",
    "Maybe it says",
    "in our exchange that looking at each other",
    "the trees whisper their contented green",
    "across any distance to be here",
    "branches heat-satiated",
    "full in our veins of holding.",
    "Maybe it says w",
    "we spoon each other a river",
    "we find in our arms the curving",
    "edges of the loving bed",
    "become a shadowed riverbank",
    "from which night animals will bend",
    "and from our abundant dreams",
    "to ease their thirst, will drink.",
    "Maybe it says",
    "the night sky we first held",
    "between us in the glowing",
    "amorphous float reaches",
    "the underside of leaves",
    "as every sentry in the moon\u2019s keep",
    "finds more of it to give away",
    "etches luminous travel",
    "with beads from tree to tree",
    "above this terra cotta,",
    "above us as we sleep."

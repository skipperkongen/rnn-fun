    "When I first saw you",
    "I could glance up from your image in the paper",
    "and out her kitchen doorway watch",
    "my mother trim her artemisia,",
    "scraps of silver trailing",
    "her green wheelbarrow.",
    "And I imagined",
    "if mine were dying,",
    "I would be on the abutment too,",
    "about to release the cable",
    "ignoring those attempting rescue;",
    "imagined your rock-weight drop",
    "pierce Merrimack gray",
    "driving you through layers of silt and barge wake",
    "till your heart burst",
    "its knot of color",
    "oiled into molecular black.",
    "And now that, years later, I have lost mine,",
    "also to disease, I see your face again",
    "transfixed in white and black,",
    "a pale sphere caught",
    "in the newspaper\u2019s grainy net.",
    "But now I would coax you back",
    "from the railing to tell you:",
    "no matter the number of months that have passed,",
    "what whole rounded year has slipped",
    "a marble from my pocket,",
    "there is a moment of breaking",
    "the surface of whatever hour",
    "and plunging past the floating glass",
    "of doorknobs turned in pain",
    "light shafts driven",
    "further into the enamel",
    "of an incandescent pedal Singer",
    "rimmed in chrome and folds of cloth",
    "whose scent can still drown me",
    "in green oblivion. Floating too",
    "an azure button, despair complete",
    "in its perfect disc, terra cotta saucer",
    "lifted by her hand",
    "with a border of fine red leaves",
    "each holding its breath for all of us,",
    "holding our grief.",
    "I would say to you:",
    "that impossible weight",
    "will drop you every day",
    "and arrows of color pierce",
    "your body clear through, the river",
    "for which you might stay."

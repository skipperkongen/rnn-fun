    "What if it were possible to vanquish",
    "All this shame with a wash of varnish",
    "Instead of wishing the stain would vanish?",
    "What if you gave it a glossy finish?",
    "What if there were a way to burnish",
    "All this foolishness, all the anguish?",
    "What if you gave yourself leave to ravish",
    "All these ravages with famished relish?",
    "What if this were your way to flourish?",
    "What if the self you love to punish \u2014",
    "Knavish, peevish, wolfish, sheepish \u2014",
    "Were all slicked up in something lavish?",
    "Why so squeamish? Why make a fetish",
    "Out of everything you must relinquish?",
    "Why not embellish what you can\u2019t abolish?",
    "What would be left if you couldn\u2019t brandish",
    "All the slavishness you\u2019ve failed to banish?",
    "What would you be without this gibberish?",
    "What if the true worth of the varnish",
    "Were to replenish your resolve to vanquish",
    "Every vain wish before you vanish?"

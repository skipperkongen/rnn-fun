    "Thus every Creature, and of every Kind,",
    "The secret Joys of sweet Coition find:",
    "Not only Man\u2019s Imperial Race; but they",
    "That wing the liquid Air, or swim the Sea,",
    "Or haunt the Desert, rush into the flame:",
    "For Love is Lord of all; and is in all the same.",
    "\u2019Tis with this rage, the Mother Lion stung,",
    "Scours o\u2019re the Plain; regardless of her young:",
    "Demanding Rites of Love, she sternly stalks;",
    "And hunts her Lover in his lonely Walks.",
    "\u2019Tis then the shapeless Bear his Den forsakes;",
    "In Woods and Fields a wild destruction makes.",
    "Boars whet their Tusks; to battle Tygers move;",
    "Enrag\u2019d with hunger, more enrag\u2019d with love.",
    "Then wo to him, that in the desert Land",
    "Of Lybia travels, o\u2019re the burning Sand.",
    "The Stallion snuffs the well-known Scent afar;",
    "And snorts and trembles for the distant Mare:",
    "Nor bitts nor Bridles, can his rage restrain;",
    "And rugged Rocks are interpos\u2019d in vain.",
    "He makes his way o\u2019re Mountains, and contemns",
    "Unruly Torrents, and unfoorded Streams.",
    "The bristled Boar, who feels the pleasing wound,",
    "New grinds his arming Tusks, and digs the ground.",
    "The sleepy Leacher shuts his little Eyes;",
    "About his churning Chaps the frothy bubbles rise:",
    "He rubs his sides against a Tree; prepares",
    "And hardens both his Shoulders for the Wars."

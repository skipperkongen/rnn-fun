    "It was like soul-kissing, the way the words",
    "filled my mouth as Mrs. Purdy read from her desk.",
    "All the other kids zoned an hour ahead to 3:15,",
    "but Mrs. Purdy and I wandered lonely as clouds borne",
    "by a breeze off Mount Parnassus. She must have seen",
    "the darkest eyes in the room brim: The next day",
    "she gave me a poem she\u2019d chosen especially for me",
    "to read to the all except for me white class.",
    "She smiled when she told me to read it, smiled harder,",
    "said oh yes I could. She smiled harder and harder",
    "until I stood and opened my mouth to banjo playing",
    "darkies, pickaninnies, disses and dats. When I finished",
    "my classmates stared at the floor. We walked silent",
    "to the buses, awed by the power of words."

    "Which reminds me of another knock-on-wood",
    "memory. I was cycling with a male friend,",
    "through a small midwestern town. We came to a 4-way",
    "stop and stopped, chatting. As we started again,",
    "a rusty old pick-up truck, ignoring the stop sign,",
    "hurricaned past scant inches from our front wheels.",
    "My partner called, \u201cHey, that was a 4-way stop!\u201d",
    "The truck driver, stringy blond hair a long fringe",
    "under his brand-name beer cap, looked back and yelled,",
    "\u201cYou fucking niggers!\u201d",
    "And sped off.",
    "My friend and I looked at each other and shook our heads.",
    "We remounted our bikes and headed out of town.",
    "We were pedaling through a clear blue afternoon",
    "between two fields of almost-ripened wheat",
    "bordered by cornflowers and Queen Anne\u2019s lace",
    "when we heard an unmuffled motor, a honk-honking.",
    "We stopped, closed ranks, made fists.",
    "It was the same truck. It pulled over.",
    "A tall, very much in shape young white guy slid out:",
    "greasy jeans, homemade finger tattoos, probably",
    "a Marine Corps boot-camp footlockerful",
    "of martial arts techniques.",
    "\u201cWhat did you say back there!\u201d he shouted.",
    "My friend said, \u201cI said it was a 4-way stop.",
    "You went through it.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd what did I say?\u201d the white guy asked.",
    "\u201cYou said: \u2018You fucking niggers.\u2019\u201d",
    "The afternoon froze.",
    "\u201cWell,\u201d said the white guy,",
    "shoving his hands into his pockets",
    "and pushing dirt around with the pointed toe of his boot,",
    "\u201cI just want to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201d",
    "He climbed back into his truck",
    "and drove away."

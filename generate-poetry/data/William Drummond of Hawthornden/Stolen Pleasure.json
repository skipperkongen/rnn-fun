    "My sweet did sweetly sleep,",
    "And on her rosy face",
    "Stood tears of pearl, which beauty\u2019s self did weep;",
    "I, wond\u2019ring at her grace,",
    "Did all amaz\u2019d remain,",
    "When Love said, \u201cFool, can looks thy wishes crown?",
    "Time past comes not again.\u201d",
    "Then did I me bow down,",
    "And kissing her fair breast, lips, cheeks, and eyes",
    "Prov\u2019d here on earth the joys of paradise."

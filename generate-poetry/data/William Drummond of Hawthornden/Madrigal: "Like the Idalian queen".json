    "Like the Idalian queen,",
    "Her hair about her eyne,",
    "With neck and breast\u2019s ripe apples to be seen,",
    "At first glance of the morn",
    "In Cyprus\u2019 gardens gathering those fair flowers",
    "Which of her blood were born,",
    "I saw, but fainting saw, my paramours.",
    "The Graces naked danced about the place,",
    "The winds and trees amazed",
    "With silence on her gazed,",
    "The flowers did smile, like those upon her face;",
    "And as their aspen stalks those fingers band,",
    "That she might read my case,",
    "A hyacinth I wished me in her hand."

    "Very soon the Yankee teachers",
    "Came down and set up school;",
    "But, oh! how the Rebs did hate it,\u2014",
    "It was agin\u2019 their rule.",
    "Our masters always tried to hide",
    "Book learning from our eyes;",
    "Knowledge did\u2019nt agree with slavery\u2014",
    "\u2019Twould make us all too wise.",
    "But some of us would try to steal",
    "A little from the book.",
    "And put the words together,",
    "And learn by hook or crook.",
    "I remember Uncle Caldwell,",
    "Who took pot liquor fat",
    "And greased the pages of his book,",
    "And hid it in his hat.",
    "And had his master ever seen",
    "The leaves upon his head,",
    "He\u2019d have thought them greasy papers,",
    "But nothing to be read.",
    "And there was Mr. Turner\u2019s Ben,",
    "Who heard the children spell,",
    "And picked the words right up by heart,",
    "And learned to read \u2019em well.",
    "Well, the Northern folks kept sending",
    "The Yankee teachers down;",
    "And they stood right up and helped us,",
    "Though Rebs did sneer and frown.",
    "And I longed to read my Bible,",
    "For precious words it said;",
    "But when I begun to learn it,",
    "Folks just shook their heads,",
    "And said there is no use trying,",
    "Oh! Chloe, you\u2019re too late;",
    "But as I was rising sixty,",
    "I had no time to wait.",
    "So I got a pair of glasses,",
    "And straight to work I went,",
    "And never stopped till I could read",
    "The hymns and Testament.",
    "Then I got a little cabin",
    "A place to call my own\u2014",
    "And I felt independent",
    "As the queen upon her throne."

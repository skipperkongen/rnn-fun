    "Heard you that shriek? It rose",
    "So wildly on the air,",
    "It seem\u2019d as if a burden\u2019d heart",
    "Was breaking in despair.",
    "Saw you those hands so sadly clasped\u2014",
    "The bowed and feeble head\u2014",
    "The shuddering of that fragile form\u2014",
    "That look of grief and dread?",
    "Saw you the sad, imploring eye?",
    "Its every glance was pain,",
    "As if a storm of agony",
    "Were sweeping through the brain.",
    "She is a mother pale with fear,",
    "Her boy clings to her side,",
    "And in her kyrtle vainly tries",
    "His trembling form to hide.",
    "He is not hers, although she bore",
    "For him a mother\u2019s pains;",
    "He is not hers, although her blood",
    "Is coursing through his veins!",
    "He is not hers, for cruel hands",
    "May rudely tear apart",
    "The only wreath of household love",
    "That binds her breaking heart.",
    "His love has been a joyous light",
    "That o\u2019er her pathway smiled,",
    "A fountain gushing ever new,",
    "Amid life\u2019s desert wild.",
    "His lightest word has been a tone",
    "Of music round her heart,",
    "Their lives a streamlet blent in one\u2014",
    "Oh, Father! must they part?",
    "They tear him from her circling arms,",
    "Her last and fond embrace.",
    "Oh! never more may her sad eyes",
    "Gaze on his mournful face.",
    "No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks",
    "Disturb the listening air:",
    "She is a mother, and her heart",
    "Is breaking in despair."

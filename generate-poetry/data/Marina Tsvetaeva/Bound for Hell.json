    "Hell, my ardent sisters, be assured,",
    "Is where we\u2019re bound; we\u2019ll drink the pitch of hell\u2014",
    "We, who have sung the praises of the lord",
    "With every fiber in us, every cell.",
    "We, who did not manage to devote",
    "Our nights to spinning, did not bend and sway",
    "Above a cradle\u2014in a flimsy boat,",
    "Wrapped in a mantle, we\u2019re now borne away.",
    "Every morning, every day, we\u2019d rise",
    "And have the finest Chinese silks to wear;",
    "And we\u2019d strike up the songs of paradise",
    "Around the campfire of a robbers\u2019 lair,",
    "We, careless seamstresses (our seams all ran,",
    "Whether we sewed or not)\u2014yet we have been",
    "Such dancers, we have played the pipes of Pan:",
    "The world was ours, each one of us a queen.",
    "First, scarcely draped in tatters, and disheveled,",
    "Then plaited with a starry diadem;",
    "We\u2019ve been in jails, at banquets we have reveled:",
    "But the rewards of heaven, we\u2019re lost to them,",
    "Lost in nights of starlight, in the garden",
    "Where apple trees from paradise are found.",
    "No, be assured, my gentle girls, my ardent",
    "And lovely sisters, hell is where we\u2019re bound."

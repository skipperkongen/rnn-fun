    "Though the road turn at last",
    "to death\u2019s ordinary door,",
    "and we knock there, ready",
    "to enter and it opens",
    "easily for us,",
    "yet",
    "all the long journey",
    "we shall have gone in chains,",
    "fed on knowledge-apples",
    "acrid and riddled with grubs.",
    "We taste other food that life,",
    "like a charitable farm-girl,",
    "holds out to us as we pass\u2014",
    "but our mouths are puckered,",
    "a taint of ash on the tongue.",
    "It\u2019s not joy that we\u2019ve lost\u2014",
    "wildfire, it flares",
    "in dark or shine as it will.",
    "What\u2019s gone",
    "is common happiness,",
    "plain bread we could eat",
    "with the old apple of knowledge.",
    "That old one\u2014it griped us sometimes,",
    "but it was firm, tart,",
    "sometimes delectable ...",
    "The ashen apple of these days",
    "grew from poisoned soil. We are prisoners",
    "and must eat",
    "our ration. All the long road",
    "in chains, even if, after all,",
    "we come to",
    "death\u2019s ordinary door, with time",
    "smiling its ordinary",
    "long-ago smile."

    "From the tawny light",
    "from the rainy nights",
    "from the imagination finding",
    "itself and more than itself",
    "alone and more than alone",
    "at the bottom of the well where the moon lives,",
    "can you pull me",
    "into December? a lowland",
    "of space, perception of space",
    "towering of shadows of clouds blown upon",
    "clouds over",
    "new ground, new made",
    "under heavy December footsteps?",
    "way to live?",
    "The flawed moon",
    "acts on the truth, and makes",
    "an autumn of tentative",
    "silences.",
    "You lived, but somewhere else,",
    "your presence touched others, ring upon ring,",
    "and changed. Did you think",
    "I would not change?",
    "The black moon",
    "turns away, its work done. A tenderness,",
    "unspoken autumn.",
    "We are faithful",
    "only to the imagination.",
    "imagination",
    "seizes",
    "as beauty must be truth. What holds you",
    "to what you see of me is",
    "that grasp alone."

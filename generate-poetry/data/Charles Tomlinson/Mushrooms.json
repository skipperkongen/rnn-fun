    "Eyeing the grass for mushrooms, you will find",
    "A stone or stain, a dandelion puff",
    "Deceive your eyes\u0097their colour is enough",
    "To plump the image out to mushroom size",
    "And lead you through illusion to a rind",
    "That's true\u0097flint, fleck or feather. With no haste",
    "Scent-out the earthy musk, the firm moist white,",
    "And, played-with rather than deluded, waste",
    "None of the sleights of seeing: taste the sight",
    "You gaze unsure of\u0097a resemblance, too,",
    "Is real and all its likes and links stay true",
    "To the weft of seeing. You, to begin with,",
    "May be taken in, taken beyond, that is,",
    "This place of chiaroscuro that seemed clear,",
    "For realer than a myth of clarities",
    "Are the meanings that you read and are not there:",
    "Soon, in the twilight coolness, you will come",
    "To the circle that you seek and, one by one,",
    "Stooping into their fragrance, break and gather,",
    "Your way a winding where the rest lead on",
    "Like stepping stones across a grass of water."

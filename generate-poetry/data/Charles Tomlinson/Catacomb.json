    "A capuchin\u0097long acquaintance with the dead",
    "Has left him taciturn\u0097stands guard",
    "At gate and stairhead. Silent, he awaits",
    "The coin we drop into his dish, and then",
    "Withdraws to contemplation\u0097though his eye",
    "Glides with a marvellous economy sideways",
    "Towards the stair, in silent intimation",
    ". We do\u0097and end up",
    "In a corridor with no end in view: dead",
    "Line the perspective left and right",
    "Costumed for resurrection. The guidebook had not lied",
    "Or tidied the sight away\u0097and yet",
    "said, unseen, could scarcely mean",
    "The silence throughout this city of the dead,",
    "Street on street of it calling into question",
    "That solidity the embalmer would counterfeit.",
    "Mob-cap, cape, lace, stole and cowl,",
    "Frocked children still at play",
    "In the Elysian fields of yesterday",
    "Greet each morning with a morning face",
    "Put on a century ago. Why are we here?\u0097",
    "Following this procession, bier on bier",
    "(The windowed dead, within), and those",
    "Upright and about to go, but caught",
    "Forever in their parting pose, as though",
    "They might have died out walking. Some",
    "Face us from the wall, like damaged portraits;",
    "Some, whose clothing has kept its gloss,",
    "Glow down across the years at us",
    "And why, indeed,",
    "For the sunlight through a lunette overhead",
    "Brightens along a sinuous bole of palm:",
    "Leaves catch and flare it into staring green",
    "Where a twine of tendril sways inside",
    "Between the bars. Light from that sky",
    "Comes burning off the bay",
    "Vibrant with Africa; in public gardens",
    "Tenses against the butterflies\u2019 descent",
    "The stamens of red hibiscus. Dead",
    "Dressed for the promenade they did not take,",
    "Are leaning to that light: it is the sun",
    "Must judge them, for the sin",
    "Of vanity sits lightly on them: it is the desire",
    "To feel its warmth against the skin",
    "Has set them afoot once more in this parade",
    "Of epaulette, cockade and crinoline. We are here",
    "Where no northern measure can undo",
    "So single-minded a lure\u0097if once a year",
    "The house of the dead stood open",
    "And these, dwelling beneath its roof,",
    "Were shown the world's great wonders,",
    "They would marvel beyond every other thing",
    "At the sun. Today, the dead",
    "Look out from their dark at us",
    "And keep their counsel. The capuchin",
    "Has gone off guard, to be replaced",
    "By a brother sentry whose mind is elsewhere\u0097",
    "Averted from this populace whose conversion",
    "Was nominal after all. His book",
    "Holds fast his eyes from us. His disregard",
    "Abolishes us as we pass beyond the door."

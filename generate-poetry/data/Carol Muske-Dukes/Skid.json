    "Where the snow effigies stood",
    "hard-packed and hosed to ice",
    "in front of the frat houses,",
    "in the middle of the little bridge",
    "over the stopped river,",
    "my leased car spun three times",
    "before the chainless tires caught.",
    "Each time round I saw a face:",
    "the man who imagined he loved me;",
    "the woman who confided in me,",
    "the child who cried \"no\" upon meeting me,",
    "as if he saw at once to what use",
    "we put those vanishing invented selves.",
    "The slurred tracks, ringed dark",
    "on the outbound path, froze and unfroze",
    "for weeks after the party to celebrate spring.",
    "Down the road, the local museum",
    "considered the Ice Age. The glacier",
    "slid in and out of its lit shape",
    "through a fan of color transparencies,",
    "each ray labelled with an age, a thaw,",
    "the gauged bed of the moraine. Showed how",
    "the ice junkheap hauled the broken shapes",
    "in which we live, cave and gully and flat.",
    "And a further dissolution, part of",
    "a shape we would not recognize for centuries,\u2014",
    "like the coins that tumble down the dark slide",
    "to the weighted spar that triggers the mechanism",
    "that lifts the needle to the jukebox disk: \"Blue Moon\"\u2014",
    "you saw it standing like an atomic field,",
    "charged with particles: little \"you's\" and \"me's,\"",
    "estranged suddenly from the vanity of their motion\u2014",
    "and the prefigured feel of it, music and moon,",
    "turning full force into its mindless will",
    "then stopping, my foot on the accelerator."

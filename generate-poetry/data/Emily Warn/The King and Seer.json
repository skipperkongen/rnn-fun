    "I am seriously watching how trees are always missing some leaves.",
    "They sweep the air looking for them. Nothing distracts them. Nothing.",
    "Where leaves are missing between the branches, beautiful sun porches,",
    "which disappear when the tree reaches them.",
    "\u201cWho are you?\u201d the King asks.",
    "\u201cIt is not like that,\u201d the Seer says.",
    "The Seer leaves the King alone in his throne room",
    "and starts walking to China, kicking up gravel,",
    "hurrying to find the next king.",
    "On the road between country houses,",
    "he stops to listen to trees digging the air for crickets.",
    "He wonders whether the King is mad now like the trees,",
    "or dancing and recounting the story without an end."

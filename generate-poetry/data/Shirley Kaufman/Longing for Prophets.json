    "Not for their ice-pick eyes,",
    "their weeping willow hair,",
    "and their clenched fists beating at heaven.",
    "Not for their warnings, predictions",
    "of doom. But what they promised.",
    "I don\u2019t care if their beards",
    "are mildewed, and the ladders",
    "are broken. Let them go on",
    "picking the wormy fruit. Let the one",
    "with the yoke around his neck",
    "climb out of the cistern.",
    "Let them come down from the heights",
    "in their radiant despair",
    "like the Sankei Juko dancers descending",
    "on ropes, down from these hills",
    "to the earth of their first existence.",
    "Let them follow the track",
    "we\u2019ve cut on the sides of mountains",
    "into the desert, and stumble again",
    "through the great rift, littered",
    "with bones and the walls of cities.",
    "Let them sift through the ashes",
    "with their burned hands. Let them",
    "tell us what will come after."

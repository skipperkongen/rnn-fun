    "I saw the hand of Rasputin",
    "cast in bronze and used as an oversized",
    "paperweight on someone\u2019s desk.",
    "The authentic hand. Smooth as Italian leather.",
    "It was molded from plaster before he was killed.",
    "Bought at an auction in Europe.",
    "She was a collector.",
    "She knew the value of everything.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t like Rasputin\u2019s hand",
    "on my desk, even though it wore the skin",
    "over its fine bones like a soft glove",
    "and healed the tsarevitch.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t like her Samurai sword.",
    "I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m worth.",
    "There are days when the whole world",
    "feels like somebody else\u2019s collection.",
    "Even your hands. We walk",
    "in another country and the mist",
    "slowly rises above the lake",
    "like the heaviness we left,",
    "dissolving.",
    "Only it\u2019s not our heaviness.",

    "Sometimes, waking, I forget",

    "of Valentino on my desk.",
    "Agnes Ayers was swooning in his arms,",
    "the Sheik in a rapture of lips",
    "without any words.",
    "Benevolent uncles spoke in a language.",
    "I didn\u2019t know, their fleshy hands,",
    "their anxious eyes smiling",
    "as they patted me gently on the head.",
    "Like watching a silent movie,",
    "when they opened their mouths",
    "like fish under water",
    "I turned off the sound.",

    "Once I learned the thirteen principles",
    "of Rabbi Salanter, but I remember",
    "only seven: truth, diligence, honor,",

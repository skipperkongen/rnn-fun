    "That city will be no more, no halos",
    "of spring mornings when green hills",
    "tremble in the midst and rise",
    "like barrage balloons\u2014",
    "and May won\u2019t cross its streets",
    "with shrieking birds and summer\u2019s promises.",
    "No breathless spells,",
    "no chilly ecstasies of spring water.",
    "Church towers rest on the ocean\u2019s floor,",
    "and flawless views of leafy avenues",
    "fix no one\u2019s eyes.",
    "And still we live on calmly,",
    "humbly\u2014from suitcases,",
    "in waiting rooms, on airplanes, trains,",
    "and still, stubbornly, blindly, we seek the image,",
    "the final form of things",
    "between inexplicable fits",
    "of mute despair\u2014",
    "as if vaguely remembering",
    "something that cannot be recalled,",
    "as if that submerged city were traveling with us,",
    "always asking questions,",
    "and always unhappy with our answers\u2014",
    "exacting, and perfect in its way."

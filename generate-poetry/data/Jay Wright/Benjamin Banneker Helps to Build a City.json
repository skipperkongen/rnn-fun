    "In a morning coat,",
    "hands locked behind your back,",
    "you walk gravely along the lines in your head.",
    "These others stand with you,",
    "squinting the city into place,",
    "yet cannot see what you see,",
    "what you would see",
    "\u0097a vision of these paths,",
    "laid out like a star,",
    "or like a body,",
    "the seed vibrating within itself,",
    "breaking into the open,",
    "dancing up to stop at the end of the universe.",
    "I say your vision goes as far as this,",
    "the egg of the world,",
    "where everything remains, and moves,",
    "holding what is most against it against itself,",
    "moving, as though it knew its end, against death.",
    "In that order,",
    "the smallest life, the small event take shape.",
    "Yes, even here at this point,",
    "Amma's plan consumes you,",
    "the prefigured man, Nommo, the son of God.",
    "I call you into this time,",
    "back to that spot",
    "and read these prefigurations",
    "into your mind,",
    "and know it could not be strange to you",
    "to stand in the dark and emptiness",
    "of a city not your vision alone.",
    "Now, I have searched the texts",
    "and forms of cities that burned,",
    "that decayed, or gave their children away,",
    "have been picking at my skin,",
    "watching my hand move,",
    "feeling the weight and shuttle of my body,",
    "listening with an ear as large as God's",
    "to catch some familiar tone in my voice.",
    "Now, I am here in your city,",
    "trying to find that spot",
    "where the vibration starts.",
    "There must be some mistake.",
    "Over the earth,",
    "in an open space,",
    "you and I step to the time",
    "of another ceremony.",
    "These people, changed,",
    "but still ours,",
    "shake another myth",
    "from that egg.",
    "Some will tell you",
    "that beginnings are only",
    "possible here,",
    "that only the clamor of these drums",
    "could bring our God to earth.",
    "A city, like a life,",
    "must be made in purity.",
    "So they call you,",
    "knowing you are intimate with stars,",
    "to create this city, this body.",
    "So they call you,",
    "knowing you must purge the ground.",
    "\u201cReflect on that time.\u201d",
    "The spirits move, even",
    "in the events of men,",
    "hidden in a language",
    "that cannot hide it.",
    "You were never lost",
    "in the language of number alone;",
    "you were never lost",
    "to the seed vibrating alone,",
    "holding all contradictions within it.",
    "\u201cLook back, I entreat you,\u201d",
    "over your own painful escapes.",
    "The seed now vibrates into a city,",
    "and a man now walks where you walked.",
    "Wind and rain must assault him,",
    "and a man must build against them.",
    "We know now, too, that the house",
    "must take the form of a man",
    "\u0097warmth at his head, movement at his feet,",
    "his needs and his shrine at his hands.",
    "Image of shelter image of man",
    "pulled back into himself",
    "into the seed before the movement,",
    "into the silence before the sound",
    "of movement, into stillness,",
    "which may be self-regard,",
    "or only stillness.",
    "Recall number.",
    "Recall your calculations,",
    "your sight, at night,",
    "into the secrets of stars.",
    "But still you must exorcise this ground.",
    "Can we say now",
    "that it is the god",
    "who chains us to this place?",
    "Is it this god",
    "who requires the movement,",
    "the absence of movement,",
    "the prefiguration of movement",
    "only under his control?",
    "If so,",
    "what then is the reason",
    "for these dancers,",
    "these invocations,",
    "the sight of these lesser gods",
    "lining out the land?",
    "How pitiable it is to reflect",
    "upon that god, without grace,",
    "without the sense of that small",
    "beginning of movement,",
    "where even the god",
    "becomes another and not himself,",
    "himself and not another.",
    "So they must call you,",
    "knowing you are intimate with stars;",
    "so they must call you,",
    "knowing different resolutions.",
    "You sit in contemplation,",
    "moving from line to line,",
    "struggling for a city",
    "free of that criminal act,",
    "free of anything but the small,",
    "imperceptible act, which itself becomes free.",
    "Free. Free. How will the lines fall",
    "into that configuration?",
    "How will you clear this uneasiness,",
    "posting your calculations and forecasts",
    "into a world you yourself cannot enter?",
    "Uneasy, at night,",
    "you follow stars and lines to their limits,",
    "sure of yourself, sure of the harmony",
    "of everything, and yet you moan",
    "for the lost harmony, the crack in the universe.",
    "Your twin, I search it out,",
    "and call you back;",
    "your twin, I invoke",
    "the descent of Nommo.",
    "I say your vision goes as far as this.",
    "And so you, Benjamin Banneker,",
    "walk gravely along these lines,",
    "the city a star, a body,",
    "the seed vibrating within you,",
    "and vibrating still,",
    "beyond your power,",
    "beyond mine."

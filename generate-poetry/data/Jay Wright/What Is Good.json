    "Out of the water call",
    "my luminous breath,",
    "into the bird, intending serpent, red,",
    "who shakes himself, white,",
    "out of that forest body, black.",
    "Red gourd head spirit of the bush,",
    "your breath is speech;",
    "your speech is ordinary, pure.",
    "I take you from the blue",
    "glass of my sacred windows,",
    "I ring you cold upon my father\u2019s weights.",
    "I would cook and save you",
    "in my body\u2019s house alone, light",
    "you in the useless prism of my own desires.",
    "I hold you in the yellow",
    "parchment of my soul\u2019s hand.",
    "Once I took your body for the shape",
    "of all I walked upon, your god\u2019s voice",
    "for the second of all my light.",
    "But now I count my sins against",
    "the ordinary syntax of my days.",
    "Bird of the hard wood,",
    "I would transcend the dog",
    "and fox of my father\u2019s prayers,",
    "the corn, the monkey, lion and the seed",
    "cut crudely by the cross in gold,",
    "the black figures of a Christian death.",
    "Bird, so you would change,",
    "and flutter in my mother\u2019s eyes.",
    "And in my mother\u2019s eyes",
    "still bodies have rhythms of their own.",
    "The light of dead hearts, my governors,",
    "leads my body to a stillness.",
    "I speak of stillness, and you see",
    "I still grip your rhythm to my body.",
    "Rhythm of my shade, an elephant skin.",
    "Rhythm of my hat, the llama\u2019s hair.",
    "Rhythm of my coat, the cactus\u2019 beard.",
    "Rhythm of my trousers, silkworm web.",
    "Rhythm of my shoes, pig hips.",
    "Rhytm of my seat, the heart of a tree.",
    "Rhythm of my hands in the beads.",
    "Rhythm of my hands in the cleansing water,",
    "of my eye in the perfect form of stillness,",
    "the perfect light of my mother\u2019s ecstasy.",
    "Composed, I am saved",
    "by my mother\u2019s reason,",
    "my neighbors\u2019 needs,",
    "my will to go beyond the stillness",
    "of my gods\u2019 dreams.",
    "Luminous breath,",
    "teach me compassion for this",
    "my complex body."

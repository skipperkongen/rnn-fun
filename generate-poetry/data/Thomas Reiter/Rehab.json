    "We wear harnesses like crossing guards.",
    "In a pouch over the heart,",
    "over stent and bypass, a black",
    "box with leads pressed onto metal",
    "nipples. We pedal and tread and row",
    "while our signals are picked up",
    "by antennas on the ceiling, X\u2019s",
    "like the eyes cartoonists give the dead.",
    "Angels of telemetry with vials of nitro",
    "watch over us. We beam to their monitors",
    "now a barn dance, now a moonwalk.",
    "They cuff us and pump and we keep on",
    "so tomorrow will live off today. Nurse,",
    "we won\u2019t forget the animated",
    "video of our cholesterol highway",
    "where LDL, black-hatted scowling",
    "donut holes on wheels, blocked traffic.",
    "But with muscles like gutta-percha,",
    "can we leave time\u2019s gurney in the dust?",
    "By now only the dead know more about",
    "gravity than we do. In reply, a tape",
    "of Little Richard or Jerry Lee comes on",
    "and we\u2019re singing, aloud or not, all",
    "pale infarcted pedalers, rowers, treadmillers,",
    "and our hearts are rising in the east."

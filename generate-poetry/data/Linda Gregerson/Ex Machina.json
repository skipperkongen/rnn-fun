    "When love was a question, the message arrived",
    "in the beak of a wire and plaster bird. The coloratura",
    "was hardly to be believed. For flight,",
    "it took three stagehands: two",
    "on the pulleys and one on the flute. And you",
    "thought fancy rained like grace.",
    "Our fog machine lost in the Parcel Post, we improvised",
    "with smoke. The heroine dies of tuberculosis after all.",
    "Remorse and the raw night air: any plausible tenor",
    "might cough. The passions, I take my clues",
    "from an obvious source, may be less like climatic events",
    "than we conventionalize, though I\u2019ve heard",
    "of tornadoes that break the second-best glassware",
    "and leave everything else untouched.",
    "There\u2019s a finer conviction than seamlessness",
    "elicits: the Greeks knew a god",
    "by the clanking behind his descent.",
    "The heart, poor pump, protests till you\u2019d think",
    "it\u2019s rusted past redemption, but",
    "there\u2019s tuning in these counterweights,",
    "celebration\u2019s assembled voice."

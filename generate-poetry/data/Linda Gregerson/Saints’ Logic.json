    "Love the drill, confound the dentist.",
    "Love the fever that carries me home.",
    "Meat of exile. Salt of grief.",
    "This much, indifferent",
    "affliction might yield. But how",
    "when the table is God\u2019s own board",
    "and grace must be said in company?",
    "If hatred were honey, as even",
    "the psalmist persuaded himself,",
    "then Agatha might be holding",
    "her breasts on the plate for reproach.",
    "The plate is decidedly",
    "ornamental, and who shall say that pity\u2019s",
    "not, at this remove? Her gown",
    "would be stiff with embroidery whatever",
    "the shape of the body beneath.",
    "Perhaps in heaven God can\u2019t hide",
    "his face. So the wounded",
    "are given these gowns to wear",
    "and duties that teach them the leverage",
    "of pain. Agatha listens with special",
    "regard to the barren, the dry,",
    "to those with tumors where milk",
    "should be, to those who nurse",
    "for hire. Let me swell,",
    "let me not swell. Remember the child,",
    "how its fingers go blind as it sucks.",
    "Bartholomew, flayed, intervenes",
    "for the tanners. Catherine for millers,",
    "whose wheels are of stone. Sebastian",
    "protects the arrowsmiths, and John",
    "the chandlers, because he was boiled",
    "in oil. We borrow our light",
    "where we can, here\u2019s begging the pardon",
    "of tallow and wick. And if, as we\u2019ve tried",
    "to extract from the prospect, we\u2019ll each",
    "have a sign to be known by at last\u2014",
    "a knife, a floursack, a hammer, a pot\u2014",
    "the saints can stay,",
    "the earth won\u2019t entirely have given us up."

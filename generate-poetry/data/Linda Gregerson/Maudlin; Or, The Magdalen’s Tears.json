    "If faith is a tree that sorrow grows",
    "and women, repentant or not, are swamps,",
    "a man who comes for solace here",
    "will be up to his knees and slow",
    "getting out. A name can turn on anyone.",
    "But say that a woman washes the dust",
    "from a stranger\u2019s feet",
    "and sits quite dry-eyed in front",
    "of her mirror at night.",
    "The candle flame moves with her breath, as does",
    "the hand of the painter, who sees in the flame",
    "his chance for virtuosity. She lets him leave",
    "her shoulder bare.",
    "Bedlam\u2019s distilled from a Mary too,",
    "St. Mary\u2019s of Bethlehem, shelter",
    "for all the afflicted and weak",
    "of mind. The donors conceived of as magi",
    "no doubt. The mad and the newborn",
    "serve equally well for show.",
    "A whore with a heart, the rich",
    "with a conscience, the keepers of language",
    "and hospitals badly embarrassed at times",
    "by their charge. The mirror refuses",
    "the candle, you see. And tears on another\u2019s behalf",
    "are not",
    "the mirrors he\u2019s pleased to regard.",
    "Who loves his ironies buxom and grave",
    "must hate the foolish water of her eyes."

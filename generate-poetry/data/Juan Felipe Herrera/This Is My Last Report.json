    "This is my last report:",
    "I wanted to speak of existence, the ants most of all,",
    "dressed up in their naughty flame-trousers, the exact jaws,",
    "their unknowable kindnesses, their abyss of hungers,",
    "and science, their mercilessness, their prophetic military",
    "devotions, their geometry of scent, their cocoons",
    "for the Nomenclature,",
    "I wanted to speak of the Glue Sniffers",
    "and Glue Smoothers who despise all forms",
    "unbound, loose in their amber nectars, I wanted",
    "to point to their noses, hoses and cables and networks,",
    "their tools, if I can use that word now\u2014and scales and",
    "scanners and Glue Rectories.",
    "I wanted you to meet my broom mother",
    "who carved a hole into her womb",
    "so that I could live\u2014",
    "At every sunset she stands",
    "under the shadow of the watchtowers",
    "elongating and denying her breath.",
    "I wanted to look under the rubble fields",
    "for once, for you (if you approved), flee",
    "into the bullet-riddled openness and fall flat,",
    "arched, askew, under the rubble sheets",
    "and let the rubble fill me",
    "with its sharp plates and ripped dust\u2014",
    "alphabets incomplete and humid. You,",
    "listen,",
    "a little closer",
    "to the chalk dust\u2014this child swinging her left arm,",
    "a ribbon, agitated by unnamed forces, devoured."

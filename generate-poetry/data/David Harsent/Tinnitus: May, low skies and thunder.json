    "Rough music in the lane,",
    "the love child lapped in blood",
    "and safe at her breast, the pain",
    "echoed in wood on wood,",
    "steel on steel, as they come,",
    "the women in their blacks,",
    "to hound her from house and home,",
    "bands of bitches and claques",
    "of crones with their pots and pans,",
    "their hooks and ladles and bowls,",
    "to beat outside in the street,",
    "to stand at her window and howl,",
    "while the child takes a taste of green",
    "milk and \u201cthe dead of night\u201d",
    "is all she has of her own",
    "and the music goes on and on."

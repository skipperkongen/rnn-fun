    "REVERSALS",
    "There are graves under the houses and houses",
    "under the graves and linking the three",
    "a broad stone staircase where the dead",
    "go up and the living go down. They pass one another",
    "wordlessly which might mean they don\u2019t know, or else",
    "they\u2019re pretending not to know. You can smell",
    "the orange grove on the hill; you can hear",
    "children bowling barrel hoops down the street.",
    "Two women gossip as they fill their jug at the spring.",
    "Their secrets cloud the water.",
    "Later they walk back through an avenue",
    "of cypresses, carrying the jug like a bastard child.",
    "TRAPPED",
    "In the house across the street, in a room",
    "directly opposite his, was a long mirror. When he looked",
    "out of his window, he would see himself in the room",
    "like a thief caught in a trap. He threw a stone.",
    "His neighbor ran in to the sound of breaking glass,",
    "then came to the window and shouted across:",
    "\u201cThank God for that: whenever I looked in my mirror",
    "there you were, doing something shifty behind my back.\u201d",
    "The first man turned away. The long mirror in his room",
    "brought him face to face with his neighbor, knife in hand.",
    "THE ACCUSED",
    "Just as he locked the door, as he pocketed the key,",
    "as he glanced over his shoulder, they arrested him.",
    "They tortured him until they tired of it.",
    "\u201cLook,\u201d they said,",
    "\u201cthe key is your key, the house is your house,",
    "we accept that now; but why did you put the key",
    "in your pocket as if to hide it from us?\u201d",
    "They let him go, but his name is still on a list."

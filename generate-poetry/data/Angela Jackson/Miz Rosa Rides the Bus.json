    "That day in December I sat down",
    "by Miss Muffet of Montgomery.",
    "I was myriad-weary. Feets swole",

    "No.",
    "My feets were tired. My eyes were",
    "sore. My heart was raw from hemming",
    "dirty edges of Miss L. Muffet\u2019s garment.",

    "I said\u2014This my way.",
    "She slipped her frock, disembarked,",
    "settled in the suburbs, deaf, mute, lewd, and blind.",

    "The spoiled dress.",
    "Jim Crow dies and ravens come with crumbs.",
    "They say\u2014Eat and be satisfied.",
    "I fast and pray and ride."

    "He started small: fasting here and there,",
    "days, then weeks. Once, he stood under",
    "a banyan tree for a full seven years, sitting",
    "for nothing\u2014not even to sleep. It came",
    "to him in a dream:",
    "At sunrise he\u2019d stretch, swab",
    "any cuts from the day before, and lay prone",
    "on the road while his twelve men swept",
    "the ground in front of him with sisal brooms.",
    "Even monkeys stopped and stared at this man",
    "rolling through puddles, past storefronts",
    "where children would throw him pieces",
    "of butter candy he\u2019d try and catch",
    "in his mouth at each rotation. His men",
    "swept and sang, swept and sang",
    "of jasmine-throated angels",
    "and pineapple slices in kulfi cream.",
    "He rolled and rolled. Sometimes",
    "in his dizzying spins, he thought",
    "he heard God. A whisper, but still."

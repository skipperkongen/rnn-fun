    "the neighbor burning insulation from his shed.",
    "He shows his son how to bind fence where",
    "a crippled chicken pecks at scattered feed.",
    "They talk, lean close. Rusted toys fill",
    "the side yard: old trucks, a bicycle tire,",
    "a punctured red bucket now a sieve.",
    "In the back acre, ram mounts ewe, the whole",
    "field coupling late spring. When John walks by,",
    "I kiss him. Most days we keep to ourselves.",

    "I kiss him most days. We keep to ourselves",
    "by the roadside. Two greasy boxes; a sign:",

    "Gawkers circle. The mother weeps. Watching,",

    "John tends to ordinary things: replaces the drain-",
    "pipe in the kitchen sink, sharpens knives again.",
    "I watch the neighbor teach his son to paint",
    "the tool shed all afternoon. Soon, they wrestle,",

    "In the paper I read the births and deaths,",
    "hear a sudden hammering from behind,",
    "John cursing the warped floorboards, pushing hard",
    "the back door, which still won\u2019t budge an inch.",
    "Again today no miracles at hand,",
    "just, in the field, wrens who stab at milkweed pods,",
    "a nuthatch bargaining from its split branch.",
    "7",
    "A nuthatch bargains from its split branch.",
    "Our neighbor stops by, complains our fence",
    "breaks his field. It must be moved eight inches.",
    "The puppy \u2014",
    ", we call her \u2014 pushes",
    "her nose in everything, the front yard, the garden,",
    "finds, across the road, the neighbor\u2019s trash \u2014",
    "drags stripped wire, eggshells that harden",
    "like the bones she buries off his porch.",
    "I want to say we are consoled by her,",

    "8",
    "Again we wake, our neighbor yelling at his son,",
    "poor kid standing by the porch. Tracking mud,",
    "he backs from the shouting, his father\u2019s raised fist.",
    "Later I will see him sulking near our feed shed,",
    "knotting an old piece of garden hose, kicking dust.",
    "I\u2019ll smile, ask if he\u2019s OK. But right now",

    "Faith, they say, is Abraham asked to slaughter",
    "his boy on a mountaintop. But sometimes",
    "it\u2019s just the peeling shed in gray weather,",
    "the leather harness softened, then gone rough.",
    "All day today the back pond will teem with carp.",
    "The clover will brighten. For now we lie together",
    "into late morning. Some days, it is enough."

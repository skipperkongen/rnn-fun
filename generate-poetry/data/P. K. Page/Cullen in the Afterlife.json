    "One he had never guessed. The fourth? The \ufb01fth?",
    "How could he tell, who\u2019d only known the third?",
    "Something to do with eyesight, depth of \ufb01eld.",
    "Perspective quite beyond him. Everything \ufb02at",
    "or nearly \ufb02at. The vanishing point",
    "they\u2019d tried to teach at school was out of sight",
    "and out of mind. A blank.",
    "Now, this diaphanous dimension\u2014one",
    "with neither up nor down, nor east nor west,",
    "nor orienting star to give him north.",
    "Even his name had left him. Strayed like a dog.",
    "Yet he was bathed in some unearthly light,",
    "a delicate no-color that made his \ufb02esh",
    "transparent, see-through, a Saran-Wrap self.",
    "His body without substance and his mind",
    "with nothing to think about\u2014although intact\u2014",
    "was totally minus purpose. He must",
    "Rubens had been there was a void, a vast",
    "emptiness\u2014no opulence. And then",
    "C\u00e9zanne who broke all matter up\u2014",
    "made light of it, in fact. And mad Van Gogh",
    "who, blinded by the light, cut off his ear.",
    "Gone\u2014that shadowy assembly\u2014vanished, done.",
    "Gone without substance. Like himself. A shell.",
    "Insensate in a \ufb02ash. (What was that \ufb02ash\u2014",
    "bereft of all but essence?) Was it death?",
    "He wondered about the word, so \ufb01lled with breath",
    "yet breathless, breathless, breathless. A full stop.",
    "once in Brazil, \u201cSoul of my very soul.\u201d",
    "He\u2019d prayed in Portuguese, an easier tongue\u2014",
    "for newly agnostic Anglos\u2014than his own,",
    "burdened with shibboleths and past beliefs.",
    "that made a calm within him. Where within?",
    "Was there a word for it? Was it his heart?",
    "Engulfed by love. Held in a healing beam",
    "of love-light. Had he earned such love?",
    "And how partake of such a gift when he",
    "was handicapped by Earthshine\u2014wore the stars,",
    "badges and medals of privilege and success?",
    "Desensitizers, brutalizers\u2014all",
    "the tricks that mammon plays to make one sleep.",
    "He must wake up. He must expose and strip",
    "successive layers to \ufb01nd his soul again.",
    "Where had the rubble come from? He was like",
    "a junkyard\u2014cluttered, \ufb01lled with scrap iron, tin.",
    "As dead as any metal not in use.",
    "So he must start once more. He had begun",
    "how many times? Faint glimmerings and dim",
    "memories of pasts behind the past",
    "recently lived\u2014the animal pasts and vague",
    "vegetable pasts\u2014those climbing vines and fruits;",
    "and mineral pasts (a slower pulse) the shine",
    "of gold and silver and the gray of iron.",
    "The \u201cupward anguish.\u201d",
    "What a rush of wings",
    "above him as he thought the phrase and knew",
    "angels were overhead, and over them",
    "a million suns and moons."

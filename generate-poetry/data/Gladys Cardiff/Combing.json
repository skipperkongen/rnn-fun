    "Bending, I bow my head",

    "wet and fragrant\u2014 orange",
    "parings. Her face, downcast,",
    "is quiet for one so young.",
    "I take her place. Beneath",
    "my mother\u2019s hands I feel",
    "the braids drawn up tight",
    "as piano wires and singing,",
    "vinegar-rinsed. Sitting",
    "before the oven I hear",
    "the orange coils tick",
    "the early hour before school.",

    "chair, her face downcast,",
    "intent on tearing rags",
    "in strips to braid a cotton",

    "and brown. A simple act",
    "Preparing hair. Something",
    "women do for each other,",
    "plaiting the generations."

    "In a dark time, the eye begins to see,",
    "I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;",
    "I hear my echo in the echoing wood\u2014",
    "A lord of nature weeping to a tree.",
    "I live between the heron and the wren,",
    "Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den.",
    "What\u2019s madness but nobility of soul",
    "At odds with circumstance? The day\u2019s on fire!",
    "I know the purity of pure despair,",
    "My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.",
    "That place among the rocks\u2014is it a cave,",
    "Or winding path? The edge is what I have.",
    "A steady storm of correspondences!",
    "A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,",
    "And in broad day the midnight come again!",
    "A man goes far to find out what he is\u2014",
    "Death of the self in a long, tearless night,",
    "All natural shapes blazing unnatural light.",
    "Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire.",
    "My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,",
    "Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is",
    "A fallen man, I climb out of my fear.",
    "The mind enters itself, and God the mind,",
    "And one is One, free in the tearing wind."

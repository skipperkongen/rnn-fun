    "The peasant",
    "of his wealth does boast,",
    "Yet he\u2019s scarce worth twice twenty pounds at most.",

    "He called me base, and beggar in disdain.",
    "To try the truth hereof I rate myself,",
    "And cast the little count of all my wealth.",
    "See how much Hebrew, Greek, and Poetry,",
    "Latin Rhetoric, and Philosophy,",
    "Reading, and sense in sciences profound,",
    "All valued, are not worth forty pounds.",

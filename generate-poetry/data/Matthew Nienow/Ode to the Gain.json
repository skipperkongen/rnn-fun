    "There\u2019s the paring chisel\u2019s purpose",
    "in the steamed cedar strake, its long warp",
    "laid strong against the bench,",
    "whose pocked surface is the book",
    "of what has already been made,",
    "or marred in learning\u2019s wake \u2014",
    "clamped",
    "now in the jaws one is",
    "waiting for its match, for the chisel to elaborate",
    "the pencil\u2019s scribed hypothesis, under which",
    "lies another path,",
    "through a tilting eye",
    "the curving bevel\u2019s made, the chisel rolling",
    "back tight scrolls of thinnest grain",
    "what bright",
    "sleeves begin to fleece the floor; there is a lack",
    "given to the wood, some short song cut loose",
    "from the lignin\u2019s name, that a longer",
    "more buoyant melody be made."

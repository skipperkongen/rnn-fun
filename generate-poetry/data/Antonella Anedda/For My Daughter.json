    "I love her fierceness when she fights me,",
    "shouting \"Not fair!\" Her eyes slitting",
    "like shutters in cities by the sea.",
    "Her life is rife with bonfires\u2014seen and unseen\u2014",
    "fires that burn through the turning years",
    "bringing her to life again, and again, in a miracle of smoke.",
    "This heat gives her a sense of forgiveness\u2014or so I imagine\u2014",
    "she kisses my back, capriciously, when I scold her.",
    "Maybe she recalls the scalpel by which she was born.",
    "Easy, the mark of its slash in my skin.",
    "She rose from my belly as I slept. We're bound together",
    "by peace, no shrieks of pain, and my modesty.",
    "We're a canvas by Giovanni Bellini: a virgin and a sweet rabbit."

    "August long ago, the summer Lemnian",
    "(not like the deeds of those who killed their men),",
    "the self a glowing bead, like Hephaestus falling",
    "daylong out of heaven in the old story,",
    "the island's interior a forge, a glory hole,",
    "the odor of wild thyme borne offshore steadily,",
    "the Aegean Sea purple, wine-dark, without epithet;",
    "and as I walked on the beach, my mother not long dead,",
    "the perfect crystal of my self-regard",
    "so lately flawed, and landscape made to echo",
    "my own low cry in the island's empty places,",
    "I found a pure white bone that wind and salt",
    "had scoured of every grief and all self-pity:",
    "and so I came to the love of others."

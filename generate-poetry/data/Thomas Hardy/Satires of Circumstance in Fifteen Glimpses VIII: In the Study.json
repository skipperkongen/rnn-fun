    "He enters, and mute on the edge of a chair",
    "Sits a thin-faced lady, a stranger there,",
    "A type of decayed gentility;",
    "And by some small signs he well can guess",
    "That she comes to him almost breakfastless.",
    "\"I have called \u0097 I hope I do not err \u0097",
    "I am looking for a purchaser",
    "Of some score volumes of the works",
    "Of eminent divines I own, \u0097",
    "Left by my father \u0097 though it irks",
    "My patience to offer them.\" And she smiles",
    "As if necessity were unknown;",
    "\"But the truth of it is that oftenwhiles",
    "I have wished, as I am fond of art,",
    "To make my rooms a little smart,",
    "And these old books are so in the way.\"",
    "And lightly still she laughs to him,",
    "As if to sell were a mere gay whim,",
    "And that, to be frank, Life were indeed",
    "To her not vinegar and gall,",
    "But fresh and honey-like; and Need",
    "No household skeleton at all."

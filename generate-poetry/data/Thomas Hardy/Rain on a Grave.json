    "Clouds spout upon her",
    "Their waters amain",
    "In ruthless disdain, \u2013",
    "Her who but lately",
    "Had shivered with pain",
    "As at touch of dishonour",
    "If there had lit on her",
    "So coldly, so straightly",
    "Such arrows of rain:",
    "One who to shelter",
    "Her delicate head",
    "Would quicken and quicken",
    "Each tentative tread",
    "If drops chanced to pelt her",
    "That summertime spills",
    "In dust-paven rills",
    "When thunder-clouds thicken",
    "And birds close their bills.",
    "Would that I lay there",
    "And she were housed here!",
    "Or better, together",
    "Were folded away there",
    "Exposed to one weather",
    "We both, \u2013 who would stray there",
    "When sunny the day there,",
    "Or evening was clear",
    "At the prime of the year.",
    "Soon will be growing",
    "Green blades from her mound,",
    "And daisies be showing",
    "Like stars on the ground,",
    "Till she form part of them \u2013",
    "Ay \u2013 the sweet heart of them,",
    "Loved beyond measure",
    "With a child\u2019s pleasure",
    "All her life\u2019s round."

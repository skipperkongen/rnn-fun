    "If but some vengeful god would call to me",
    "From up the sky, and laugh: \u201cThou suffering thing,",
    "Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,",
    "That thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!\u201d",
    "Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die,",
    "Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;",
    "Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I",
    "Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.",
    "But not so. How arrives it joy lies slain,",
    "And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?",
    "\u2014Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,",
    "And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan. . . .",
    "These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown",
    "Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain."

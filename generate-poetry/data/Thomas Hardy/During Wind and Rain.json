    "They sing their dearest songs\u2014",
    "He, she, all of them\u2014yea,",
    "Treble and tenor and bass,",
    "And one to play;",
    "With the candles mooning each face. . . .",
    "Ah, no; the years O!",
    "How the sick leaves reel down in throngs!",
    "They clear the creeping moss\u2014",
    "Elders and juniors\u2014aye,",
    "Making the pathways neat",
    "And the garden gay;",
    "And they build a shady seat. . . .",
    "Ah, no; the years, the years,",
    "See, the white storm-birds wing across.",
    "They are blithely breakfasting all\u2014",
    "Men and maidens\u2014yea,",
    "Under the summer tree,",
    "With a glimpse of the bay,",
    "While pet fowl come to the knee. . . .",
    "Ah, no; the years O!",
    "And the rotten rose is ript from the wall.",
    "They change to a high new house,",
    "He, she, all of them\u2014aye,",
    "Clocks and carpets and chairs",
    "On the lawn all day,",
    "And brightest things that are theirs. . . .",
    "Ah, no; the years, the years;",
    "Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs."

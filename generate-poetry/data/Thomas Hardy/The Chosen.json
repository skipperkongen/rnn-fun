    "\u201cA woman for whom great gods might strive!\u201d",
    "I said, and kissed her there:",
    "And then I thought of the other five,",
    "And of how charms outwear.",
    "I thought of the first with her eating eyes,",
    "And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray,",
    "And I thought of the third, experienced, wise,",
    "And I thought of the fourth who sang all day.",
    "And I thought of the fifth, whom I'd called a jade.",
    "And I thought of them all, tear-fraught;",
    "And that each had shown her a passable maid,",
    "Yet not of the favour sought.",
    "So I traced these words on the bark of a beech,",
    "Just at the falling of the mast:",
    "\u201cAfter scanning five; yes, each and each,",
    "I've found the woman desired \u2013 at last!\u201d",
    "\u201c\u2013I feel a strange benumbing spell,",
    "As one ill-wished!\u201d said she.",
    "And soon it seemed that something fell",
    "Was starving her love for me.",
    "\u201cI feel some curse. O,",
    "were there?\u201d",
    "And wanly she swerved, and went away.",
    "I followed sick: night numbed the air,",
    "And dark the mournful moorland lay.",
    "I cried: \u201cO darling, turn your head!\u201d",
    "But never her face I viewed;",
    "\u201cO turn, O turn!\u201d again I said,",
    "And miserably pursued.",
    "At length I came to a Christ-cross stone",
    "Which she had passed without discern;",
    "And I knelt upon the leaves there strown,",
    "And prayed aloud that she might turn.",
    "I rose, and looked; and turn she did;",
    "I cried, \u201cMy heart revives!\u201d",
    "\u201cLook more,\u201d she said. I looked as bid;",
    "Her face was all the five's.",
    "All the five women, clear come back,",
    "I saw in her \u2013 with her made one,",
    "The while she drooped upon the track,",
    "And her frail term seemed well-nigh run.",
    "She'd half forgot me in her change;",
    "\u201cWho are you? Won't you say",
    "Who you may be, you man so strange,",
    "Following since yesterday?\u201d",
    "I took the composite form she was,",
    "And carried her to an arbour small,",
    "Not passion-moved, but even because",
    "In one I could atone to all.",
    "And there she lies, and there I tend,",
    "Till my life's threads unwind,",
    "A various womanhood in blend \u2013",
    "Not one, but all combined."

    "Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.",
    "\u201cNow they are all on their knees,\u201d",
    "An elder said as we sat in a flock",
    "By the embers in hearthside ease.",
    "We pictured the meek mild creatures where",
    "They dwelt in their strawy pen,",
    "Nor did it occur to one of us there",
    "To doubt they were kneeling then.",
    "So fair a fancy few would weave",
    "In these years! Yet, I feel,",
    "If someone said on Christmas Eve,",
    "\u201cCome; see the oxen kneel,",
    "\u201cIn the lonely barton by yonder coomb",
    "Our childhood used to know,\u201d",
    "I should go with him in the gloom,",
    "Hoping it might be so."

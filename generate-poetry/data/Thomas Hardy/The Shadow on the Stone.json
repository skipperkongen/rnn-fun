    "That broods in the garden white and lone,",
    "I went by the Druid stone",
    "And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows",
    "That at some moments fall thereon",
    "From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing,",
    "And they shaped in my imagining",
    "To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders",
    "Threw there when she was gardening.",
    "I thought her behind my back,",
    "Yea, her I long had learned to lack,",
    "And I said: \u2018I am sure you are standing behind me,",
    "Though how do you get into this old track?\u2019",
    "And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf",
    "As a sad response; and to keep down grief",
    "I would not turn my head to discover",
    "That there was nothing in my belief.",
    "Yet I wanted to look and see",
    "That nobody stood at the back of me;",
    "But I thought once more: \u2018Nay, I\u2019ll not unvision",
    "A shape which, somehow, there may be.\u2019",
    "So I went on softly from the glade,",
    "And left her behind me throwing her shade,",
    "As she were indeed an apparition\u2014",
    "My head unturned lest my dream should fade."

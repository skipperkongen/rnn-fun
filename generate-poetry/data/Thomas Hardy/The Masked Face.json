    "I found me in a great surging space,",
    "At either end a door,",
    "And I said: \"What is this giddying place,",

    "That I knew not of before?\"",
    "\"It is Life,\" said a mask-clad face.",
    "I asked: \"But how do I come here,",
    "Who never wished to come;",
    "Can the light and air be made more clear,",
    "The floor more quietsome,",
    "And the doors set wide? They numb",
    "Fast-locked, and fill with fear.\"",
    "The mask put on a bleak smile then,",
    "And said, \"O vassal-wight,",
    "There once complained a goosequill pen",
    "To the scribe of the Infinite",
    "Of the words it had to write",
    "Because they were past its ken.\""

    "That night your great guns, unawares,",
    "Shook all our coffins as we lay,",
    "And broke the chancel window-squares,",
    "We thought it was the Judgment-day",
    "And sat upright. While drearisome",
    "Arose the howl of wakened hounds:",
    "The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,",
    "The worms drew back into the mounds,",
    "The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, \u201cNo;",
    "It\u2019s gunnery practice out at sea",
    "Just as before you went below;",
    "The world is as it used to be:",
    "\u201cAll nations striving strong to make",
    "Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters",
    "They do no more for Christ\u00e9s sake",
    "Than you who are helpless in such matters.",
    "\u201cThat this is not the judgment-hour",
    "For some of them\u2019s a blessed thing,",
    "For if it were they\u2019d have to scour",
    "Hell\u2019s floor for so much threatening....",
    "\u201cHa, ha. It will be warmer when",
    "I blow the trumpet (if indeed",
    "I ever do; for you are men,",
    "And rest eternal sorely need).\u201d",
    "So down we lay again. \u201cI wonder,",
    "Will the world ever saner be,\u201d",
    "Said one, \u201cthan when He sent us under",
    "In our indifferent century!\u201d",
    "And many a skeleton shook his head.",
    "\u201cInstead of preaching forty year,\u201d",
    "My neighbour Parson Thirdly said,",
    "\u201cI wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.\u201d",
    "Again the guns disturbed the hour,",
    "Roaring their readiness to avenge,",
    "As far inland as Stourton Tower,",
    "And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge."

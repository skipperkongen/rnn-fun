    "I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,",
    "And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;",
    "And the wheel\u2019s kick and the wind\u2019s song and the white sail\u2019s shaking,",
    "And a grey mist on the sea\u2019s face, and a grey dawn breaking.",
    "I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide",
    "Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;",
    "And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,",
    "And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.",
    "I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,",
    "To the gull\u2019s way and the whale\u2019s way where the wind\u2019s like a whetted knife;",
    "And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,",
    "And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick\u2019s over."

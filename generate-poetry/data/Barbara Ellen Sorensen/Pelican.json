    "Under warm New Mexico sun,",
    "we watched the pelican place",
    "himself down among the mallards",
    "as if he had been there all along,",
    "as if they were expecting the large,",
    "cumbersome body, the ungainliness.",
    "And he, sensing his own unsightly",
    "appearance, tucked his head close",
    "to his body and took on the smooth",
    "insouciance of a swan."

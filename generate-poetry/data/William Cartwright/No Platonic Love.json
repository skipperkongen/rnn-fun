    "Tell me no more of minds embracing minds,",
    "And hearts exchang\u2019d for hearts;",
    "That spirits spirits meet, as winds do winds,",
    "And mix their subt\u2019lest parts;",
    "That two unbodied essences may kiss,",
    "And then like Angels, twist and feel one Bliss.",
    "I was that silly thing that once was wrought",
    "To practise this thin love;",
    "I climb\u2019d from sex to soul, from soul to thought;",
    "But thinking there to move,",
    "Headlong I rolled from thought to soul, and then",
    "From soul I lighted at the sex again.",
    "As some strict down-looked men pretend to fast,",
    "Who yet in closets eat;",
    "So lovers who profess they spirits taste,",
    "Feed yet on grosser meat;",
    "I know they boast they souls to souls convey,",
    "Howe\u2019r they meet, the body is the way.",
    "Come I will undeceive thee, they that tread",
    "Those vain aerial ways,",
    "Are like young heirs and alchemists misled",
    "To waste their wealth and days,",
    "For searching thus to be for ever rich,",
    "They only find a med\u2019cine for the itch."

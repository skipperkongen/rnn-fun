    "It is too early for white boughs, too late",
    "For snows. From out the hedge the wind lets fall",
    "A few last flakes, ragged and delicate.",
    "Down the stripped roads the maples start their small,",
    "Soft, \u2019wildering fires. Stained are the meadow stalks",
    "A rich and deepening red. The willow tree",
    "Is woolly. In deserted garden-walks",
    "The lean bush crouching hints old royalty,",
    "Feels some June stir in the sharp air and knows",
    "Soon \u2019twill leap up and show the world a rose.",
    "The days go out with shouting; nights are loud;",
    "Wild, warring shapes the wood lifts in the cold;",
    "The moon\u2019s a sword of keen, barbaric gold,",
    "Plunged to the hilt into a pitch black cloud."

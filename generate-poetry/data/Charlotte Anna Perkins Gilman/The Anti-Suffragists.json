    "Fashionable women in luxurious homes,",
    "With men to feed them, clothe them, pay their bills,",
    "Bow, doff the hat, and fetch the handkerchief;",
    "Hostess or guest, and always so supplied",
    "With graceful deference and courtesy;",
    "Surrounded by their servants, horses, dogs, \u2014",
    "These tell us they have all the rights they want.",
    "Successful women who have won their way",
    "Alone, with strength of their unaided arm,",
    "Or helped by friends, or softly climbing up",
    "By the sweet aid of \u2018woman\u2019s influence\u2019;",
    "Successful any way, and caring naught",
    "For any other woman\u2019s unsuccess, \u2014",
    "These tell us they have all the rights they want.",
    "Religious women of the feebler sort, \u2014",
    "Not the religion of a righteous world,",
    "A free, enlightened, upward-reaching world,",
    "But the religion that considers life",
    "As something to back out of! \u2014 whose ideal",
    "Is to renounce, submit, and sacrifice,",
    "Counting on being patted on the head",
    "And given a high chair when they get to heaven, \u2014",
    "These tell us they have all the rights they want.",
    "Ignorant women \u2014 college-bred sometimes,",
    "But ignorant of life\u2019s realities",
    "And principles of righteous government,",
    "And how the privileges they enjoy",
    "Were won with blood and tears by those before \u2014",
    "Those they condemn, whose ways they now oppose;",
    "Saying, \u2018Why not let well enough alone?",
    "Our world is very pleasant as it is,\u2019 \u2014",
    "These tell us they have all the rights they want.",
    "And selfish women, \u2014 pigs in petticoats, \u2014",
    "Rich, poor, wise, unwise, top or bottom round,",
    "But all sublimely innocent of thought,",
    "And guiltless of ambition, save the one",
    "Deep, voiceless aspiration \u2014 to be fed!",
    "These have no use for rights or duties more.",
    "Duties today are more than they can meet,",
    "And law insures their right to clothes and food, \u2014",
    "These tell us they have all the rights they want.",
    "And, more\u2019s the pity, some good women, too;",
    "Good conscientious women, with ideas;",
    "Who think \u2014 or think they think \u2014 that woman\u2019s cause",
    "Is best advanced by letting it alone;",
    "That she somehow is not a human thing,",
    "And not to be helped on by human means,",
    "Just added to humanity \u2014 an \u2018L\u2019 \u2014",
    "A wing, a branch, an extra, not mankind, \u2014",
    "These tell us they have all the rights they want.",
    "And out of these has come a monstrous thing,",
    "A strange, down-sucking whirlpool of disgrace,",
    "Women uniting against womanhood,",
    "And using that great name to hide their sin!",
    "Vain are their words as that old king\u2019s command",
    "Who set his will against the rising tide.",
    "But who shall measure the historic shame",
    "Of these poor traitors \u2014 traitors are they all \u2014",
    "To great Democracy and Womanhood!"

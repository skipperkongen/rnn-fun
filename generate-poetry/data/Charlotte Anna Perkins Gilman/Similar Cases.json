    "There was once a little animal,",
    "No bigger than a fox,",
    "And on five toes he scampered",
    "Over Tertiary rocks.",
    "They called him Eohippus,",
    "And they called him very small,",
    "And they thought him of no value --",
    "When they thought of him at all;",
    "For the lumpish old Dinoceras",
    "And Coryphodon so slow",
    "Were the heavy aristocracy",
    "In days of long ago.",
    "Said the little Eohippus,",
    "\u201cI am going to be a horse!",
    "And on my middle finger-nails",
    "To run my earthly course!",
    "I\u2019m going to have a flowing tail!",
    "I\u2019m going to have a mane!",
    "I\u2019m going to stand fourteen hands high",
    "On the psychozoic plain!\u201d",
    "The Coryphodon was horrified,",
    "The Dinoceras was shocked;",
    "And they chased young Eohippus,",
    "But he skipped away and mocked.",
    "Then they laughed enormous laughter,",
    "And they groaned enormous groans.",
    "And they bade young Eohippus",
    "Go view his father\u2019s bones.",
    "Said they, \u201cYou always were as small",
    "And mean as now we see,",
    "And that\u2019s conclusive evidence",
    "That you\u2019re always going to be.",
    "What! Be a great, tall, handsome beast,",
    "With hoofs to gallop on?",
    "Said the Loxolophodon.",
    "They considered him disposed of,",
    "And retired with gait serene;",
    "That was the way they argued",
    "In \u201cthe early Eocene\u201d.",
    "There was once an Anthropoidal Ape,",
    "Far smarter than the rest,",
    "And everything that they could do",
    "He always did the best;",
    "So they naturally disliked him",
    "And they gave him shoulders cool,",
    "And when they had to mention him",
    "They said he was a fool.",
    "Cried this pretentious Ape one day,",
    "\u201cI\u2019m going to be a man!",
    "And stand upright, and hunt, and fight,",
    "And conquer all I can!",
    "I\u2019m going to cut down forest trees,",
    "To make my houses higher!",
    "I\u2019m going to kill the Mastodon!",
    "I\u2019m going to make a fire!\u201d",
    "Loud screamed the Anthropoidal Apes",
    "With laughter wild and gay;",
    "They tried to catch that boastful one,",
    "But he always got away.",
    "So they yelled at him in chorus,",
    "Which he minded not a whit;",
    "And they pelted him with cocoanuts,",
    "Which didn\u2019t seem to hit.",
    "And then they gave him reasons",
    "Which they thought of much avail,",
    "To prove how his preposterous",
    "Attempt was sure to fail.",
    "Said the sages, \u201cIn the first place,",
    "The thing cannot be done!",
    "And, second, if it",
    "be,",
    "It would not be any fun!",
    "And, third, and most conclusive,",
    "And admitting no reply,",
    "You would have to change your nature!",
    "We should like to see you try!\u201d",
    "They chuckled then triumphantly,",
    "These lean and hairy shapes,",
    "For these things passed as arguments",
    "With the Anthropoidal Apes.",
    "There was once a Neolithic Man,",
    "An enterprising wight,",
    "Who made his chopping implements",
    "Unusually bright.",
    "Unusually clever he,",
    "Unusually brave,",
    "And he drew delightful Mammoths",
    "On the borders of his cave.",
    "To his Neolithic neighbours,",
    "Who were startled and surprised,",
    "Said he, \u201cMy friends, in course of time,",
    "We shall be civilized!",
    "We are going to live in cities!",
    "We are going to fight in wars!",
    "We are going to eat three times a day",
    "Without the natural cause!",
    "We are going to turn life upside down",
    "About a thing called gold!",
    "We are going to want the earth, and take",
    "As much as we can hold!",
    "We are going to wear great piles of stuff",
    "Outside our proper skins!",
    "We are going to have Diseases!",
    "And Accomplishments!! And Sins!!!\u201d",
    "Then they all rose up in fury",
    "Against their boastful friend,",
    "For prehistoric patience",
    "Cometh quickly to an end.",
    "Said one, \u201cThis is chimerical!",
    "Utopian! Absurd!\u201d",
    "Said another, \u201cWhat a stupid life!",
    "Too dull, upon my word!\u201d",
    "Cried all, Before such things can come,",
    "You idiotic child,",
    "\u201d",
    "And they all sat back and smiled.",
    "Thought they, \u201cAn answer to that last",
    "It will be hard to find!\u201d",
    "It was a clinching argument",
    "To the Neolithic Mind!"

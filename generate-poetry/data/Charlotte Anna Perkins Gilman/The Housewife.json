    "Here is the House to hold me \u0097 cradle of all the race;",
    "Here is my lord and my love, here are my children dear \u0097",
    "Here is the House enclosing, the dear-loved dwelling place;",

    "Here for the hours of the day and the hours of the night;",
    "Bound with the bands of Duty, rivetted tight;",
    "Duty older than Adam \u0097 Duty that saw",
    "Acceptance utter and hopeless in the eyes of the serving squaw.",
    "Food and the serving of food \u0097 that is my daylong care;",
    "What and when we shall eat, what and how we shall wear;",
    "Soiling and cleaning of things \u0097 that is my task in the main \u0097",
    "Soil them and clean them and soil them \u0097 soil them and clean them again.",
    "To work at my trade by the dozen and never a trade to know;",
    "To plan like a Chinese puzzle \u0097 fitting and changing so;",
    "To think of a thousand details, each in a thousand ways;",
    "For my own immediate people and a possible love and praise.",
    "My mind is trodden in circles, tiresome, narrow and hard,",
    "Useful, commonplace, private \u0097 simply a small back-yard;",
    "And I the Mother of Nations! \u0097 Blind their struggle and vain! \u0097",
    "I cover the earth with my children \u0097 each with a housewife's brain."

    "We won\u2019t pretend we\u2019re not hungry for distinction",
    "but what can ever distinguish us enough?",
    "This country, this language won\u2019t last long, the race",
    "will die, later the cockroach, earth itself,",
    "and last this beer bottle: silicon fused by man,",
    "almost indestructible, like a soul:",
    "it will go spinning ever farther from the nearest thing",
    "until space, continually deepening, drowns in itself.",
    "Yet we keep a hungry eye on old schoolmates",
    "and everyone born in the year of our own birth,",
    "and spend the nights in ranting over them,",
    "their money, fashionable companions, pliant critics.",
    "To live just a little longer than they do:",
    "that would be triumph. Hence exercise and diets,",
    "and the squabble over who will write the history",
    "of this paradise of demons casting each other out."

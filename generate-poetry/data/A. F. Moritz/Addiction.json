    "I wish we could control this revolting",
    "want of control: these people",
    "with their spongy eyes, their mouths",
    "of trembling shoehorns, billhooks for penises",
    "and bear traps for vulvas.",
    "One taste of sunlight and at once",
    "they can\u2019t do without it. Water,",
    "the same, and food, and air,",
    "and a dozen other squalid habits.",
    "Some\u2014like their copulation,",
    "a rusting carnation in a cut-glass neck\u2014",
    "are not physically compulsive but",
    "the partners can\u2019t stop wanting them to be:",
    "so we desire to be raped",
    "by love, who would fill us, they say,",
    "with an oil from the lit braziers of stars.",
    "What if, doing it every day,",
    "we resemble pistons, and the slow poison",
    "cuts our lives off at 70:",
    "it\u2019s the grim determination",
    "of our passion. And beyond this, even I\u2014",
    "defended in childhood by my strong father",
    "the piano and my mother the virtuoso",
    "from knuckles among warehouses\u2014even I",
    "am addicted to the mild light of words."

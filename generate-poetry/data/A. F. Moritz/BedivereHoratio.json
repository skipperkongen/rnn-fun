    "Each living thing is like a kingdom",
    "that rises not quite out of nothing: April stirrings",
    "of some boy and the May beauty",
    "of a generous princess. Then came children\u2014",
    "who could calculate their splendor?",
    "And there were factories in valleys, mile after mile,",
    "dragons of purple smoke, blue flames at night,",
    "castles hidden in forests equally hidden",
    "where a shining company rode through flowers",
    "to pacify the dangerous land. Triangular sails,",
    "violet, saffron, and rose, glowed beyond coves",
    "under cliffs dangling silver torques of waterfall.",
    "Later the parents aged and grew more grateful,",
    "more full of a certainty that could not be glimpsed",
    "or dismayed, and then the children",
    "were gone to some other land",
    "as if to heaven, yet the mourning",
    "was not for death. Now by a quiet wall",
    "buckled cement gives a bright home",
    "to milkweeds like strange skeletons,",
    "pale green, intact and upright, and tall white grasses",
    "that never wave. The sole survivor\u2014",
    "a duty was laid on him",
    "to tell the tale among new minds, other ways,",
    "and how do we imagine him,",
    "wherever he\u2019s gone\u2014all that remains,",
    "scholar of an unread book,",
    "beggar of an unfilled cup,",
    "an unknown variation,",
    "the thought of the kingdom in a lost man?"

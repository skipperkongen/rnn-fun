    "It\u2019s not that I harbor a weeping willow",
    "Shadow\u2019s worth of longing for those cloaked",
    "Turns and straight-aways, or that swampy",
    "South Mississippi was ever half as tragic",
    "As I dreamed it could be, but that I still cruise",

    "There, starving for something more,",
    "Something other than the black wheel",
    "Spinning that sudden dark, cricketed quiet."

    "I asked my father,",
    "\u201cwould you rather die",
    "of cancer or a heart attack?",
    "Would you rather be executed",
    "or put in jail for life?",
    "Which would you rather be\u2014",
    "a spy or a sentinel?\u201d",
    "And he tried to answer",
    "honestly, combing his thinning hair",
    "with his fingers, thinking of something else.",
    "At last he fell silent. I ran out",
    "to savor the dregs of dusk",
    "playing with my friends",
    "in the road that led to the highway.",
    "The ball flew up toward day",
    "and landed in night.",
    "We chanted. Every other minute",
    "a truck, summoned by our warnings,",
    "brushed past in a gust of light,",
    "the driver\u2019s curses muffled",
    "by distance: the oncoming wheels",
    "were the point of the game,",
    "like the scores in chalk",
    "or the blood from scuffed knees",
    "that we smeared across our faces:",
    "so when my mother called,",
    "her voice was quaint and stymied",
    "and I took all the time in the world",
    "trotting home past tarped barbecue pits,",
    "past names of lovers filling with sap,",
    "past tentative wind from sprinklers:",
    "then I was stunned to see my golden window",
    "where all faces, hanging plants, dangling pots",
    "were framed by night and dwarfed",
    "by a ravenous inward-turning light."

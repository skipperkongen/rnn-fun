    "They pay us time and a half",
    "and don\u2019t dare catch us",
    "drinking: we don\u2019t insist,",
    "don\u2019t pass a bottle, but each sips",
    "a private pint, all sitting",
    "in the narrow room with our backs",
    "to the center, each facing",
    "his work\u2014router, stain tray,",
    "buffing wheel, drill press\u2014",
    "and with that sweet taste echoing",
    "in our bones, we watch our hands",
    "make what they always made",
    "\u2014rosewood handles\u2014but now",
    "we smile in delighted surprise",
    "and Marchesi brings envelopes",
    "that record a full day\u2019s work",
    "though it\u2019s still noon,",
    "processions still fill the streets,",
    "choirs, loudspeakers bellowing",
    "Hallelujah: and we change",
    "into our finest clothes in the locker room,",
    "admiring each other\u2019s hat brims, passing bottles",
    "freely until all are empty, and at last",
    "we separate in the brilliant street, each",
    "in the direction of a different tolling bell."

    "We want to give ourselves away utterly",
    "but afterwards we resent it, it is the same",
    "with the sparrows, their eyes burn so coldly",
    "under the dusty pines, their small chests swell",
    "as they dispute a crumb, or the empty place",
    "where a seed was once: this is our law too,",
    "to peck and peck at the Self, to take turns",
    "being",
    ", to die in a fierce sidelong glance,",
    "then to hold the entire forest in one tilt",
    "of a tufted head, to take flight suddenly",
    "and fuck in midair, tumbling upward."

    "sometimes touching each other\u2019s cheek with a \ufb01ngernail",
    "gingerly: the radio played ecstatic static: certain roads",
    "marked with blue enamel numbers led to cloud banks,",
    "or basalt screes, or dim hotels with padlocked verandas.",
    "Sometimes they quarreled, sometimes they grew old,",
    "the wind was constant in their eyes, it was their own wind,",
    "they made it. Small towns \ufb02ew past, Rodez, Albi,",
    "limestone quarries, pear orchards, children racing",
    "after hoops, wobbling when their shadows wavered,",
    "infants crying for \ufb01ne rain, old women on stoops",
    "darning gray veils\u2014and who were we, watching?",
    "Doubles, ghosts, the ones who would tell of the \ufb01eld",
    "where they pulled over, bluish tinge of the elms, steepness",
    "of the other\u2019s eyes, glowworm hidden in its own glint,",
    "how the rain was twilight and now is darkness."

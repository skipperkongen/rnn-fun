    "It is the great arguments",
    "we are proud of, over a nibbled peach,",
    "hair in the comb, a faulty lube job;",
    "the reconciliations were always naked",
    "in borrowed rooms, sometimes in Queens",
    "or Staten Island, we touched each other",
    "shyly\u2014we reminded each other",
    "of loneliness and funk and beautiful pigeons",
    "with oil-slick necks, cooing bitterly\u2014",
    "but there we lost each other",
    "in forgiveness; keeping score,",
    "being wounded even in triumph,",
    "walking home down leafy avenues",
    "etched with the faint double line",
    "of extinct trolleys, caressing",
    "carved hearts under a sheen of sap",
    "with a ragged nail, sleeping alone,",
    "choosing the dream of betrayal,",
    "entering by the wide door",
    "and waking dead\u2014there",
    "we were superb. In Brooklyn",
    "we held our own."

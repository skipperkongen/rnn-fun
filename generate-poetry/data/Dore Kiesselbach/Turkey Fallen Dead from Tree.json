    "Startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor\u2019s mutt,",
    "it banged its buzzard\u2019s head then couldn\u2019t solve",
    "the problem of the white pine\u2019s limbs",
    "with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent.",
    "Somewhere an awkward angel knows",
    "whether it was dead before it hit the ground.",
    "Any sinner could tell it was dead after\u2014",
    "eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids,",
    "feet drawn up almost as high as hands.",
    "I loved to watch thistle and millet",
    "disappear beneath it in the yard.",
    "As snow covers feathers that will still be",
    "iridescent in the spring I remember seeing",
    "a businessman take a dripping handful",
    "of pocket change and throw it down",
    "a subway grate beside a homeless man.",
    "The coins bounced and clattered, vanishing",
    "in the humid dark. The rich man said",
    "now you\u2019re having a shitty day too.",
    "But it\u2019s not a shitty day and won\u2019t be",
    "when I retrieve the bird and walk it\u2014",
    "toes curling stiff from a shopping bag\u2014",
    "to a houseless scrap of oak savannah",
    "birdseed drew it from and dig it",
    "into deeper snow so what was hoarded",
    "by a man may by the thaw be doled."

    "Clear night, thumb-top of a moon, a back-lit sky.",
    "Moon-fingers lay down their same routine",
    "On the side deck and the threshold, the white keys and the black keys.",
    "Bird hush and bird song. A cassia flower falls.",
    "I want to be bruised by God.",
    "I want to be strung up in a strong light and singled out.",
    "I want to be stretched, like music wrung from a dropped seed.",
    "I want to be entered and picked clean.",
    "And the wind says \u201cWhat?\u201d to me.",
    "And the castor beans, with their little earrings of death, say \u201cWhat?\u201d to me.",
    "And the stars start out on their cold slide through the dark.",
    "And the gears notch and the engines wheel."

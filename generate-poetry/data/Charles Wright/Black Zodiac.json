    "Darkened by time, the masters, like our memories, mix",
    "And mismatch,",
    "and settle about our lawn furniture, like air",
    "Without a meaning, like air in its clear nothingness.",
    "What can we say to either of them?",
    "How can they be so dark and so clear at the same time?",
    "They ruffle our hair,",
    "they ruffle the leaves of the August trees.",
    "Then stop, abruptly as wind.",
    "The flies come back, and the heat\u2014",
    "what can we say to them?",
    "Nothing is endless but the sky.",
    "The flies come back, and the afternoon",
    "Teeters a bit on its green edges,",
    "then settles like dead weight",
    "Next to our memories, and the pale hems of the masters\u2019 gowns.",
    "________",
    "Perhaps. And perhaps not\u2014",
    "dust and ashes though we are,",
    "Some will go wordlessly, some",
    "Where pain puts them, an inch-and-a-half above the floor.",
    "And some will revile him out of love",
    "and deep disdain.",
    "The gates of mercy, like an eclipse, darken our undersides.",
    "Rows of gravestones stay our steps,",
    "August humidity",
    "Bright as auras around our bodies.",
    "And some will utter the words,",
    "speaking in fear and tongues,",
    "Hating their garments splotched by the flesh.",
    "These are the lucky ones, the shelved ones, the twice-erased.",
    "________",
    "Dante and John Chrysostom",
    "Might find this afternoon a sidereal roadmap,",
    "A pilgrim\u2019s way ...",
    "You might too",
    "Under the prejaundiced outline of the quarter moon,",
    "Clouds sculling downsky like a narrative for",
    "What",
    "Still lurking behind the stars,",
    "31 August 1995 ...",
    "The afterlife of insects, space graffiti, white holes",
    "In the landscape,",
    "such things, such avenues, lead to dust",
    "And handle our hurt with ease.",
    "Sky blue, blue of infinity, blue",
    "waters above the earth:",
    "Why do the great stories always exist in the past?",
    "________",
    "The unexamined life\u2019s no different from",
    "the examined life\u2014",
    "Unanswerable questions, small talk,",
    "Unprovable theorems, long-abandoned arguments\u2014",
    "You\u2019ve got to write it all down.",
    "Landscape or waterscape, light-length on evergreen, dark sidebar",
    "Of evening,",
    "you\u2019ve got to write it down.",
    "Memory\u2019s handkerchief, death\u2019s dream and automobile,",
    "God\u2019s sleep,",
    "you\u2019ve still got to write it down,",
    "Moon half-empty, moon half-full,",
    "Night starless and egoless, night blood-black and prayer-black,",
    "Spider at work between the hedges,",
    "Last bird call,",
    "toad in a damp place, tree frog in a dry ...",
    "________",
    "We go to our graves with secondary affections,",
    "Second-hand satisfaction, half-souled,",
    "star charts demagnetized.",
    "We go in our best suits. The birds are flying. Clouds pass.",
    "Sure we\u2019re cold and untouchable,",
    "but we harbor no ill will.",
    "No tooth tuned to resentment\u2019s fork,",
    "we\u2019re out of here, and sweet meat.",
    "Calligraphers of the disembodied, God\u2019s word-wards,",
    "What letters will we illuminate?",
    "Above us, the atmosphere,",
    "The nothing that\u2019s nowhere, signs on, and waits for our beck and call.",
    "Above us, the great constellations sidle and wince,",
    "The letters undarken and come forth,",
    "Your X and my X.",
    "The letters undarken and they come forth.",
    "________",
    "Eluders of memory, nocturnal sleep of the greenhouse,",
    "Spirit of slides and silences,",
    "Invisible Hand,",
    "Witness and walk on.",
    "Lords of the discontinuous, lords of the little gestures,",
    "Succor my shift and save me ...",
    "All afternoon the rain has rained down in the mind,",
    "And in the gardens and dwarf orchard.",
    "All afternoon",
    "The lexicon of late summer has turned its pages",
    "Under the rain,",
    "abstracting the necessary word.",
    "Autumn\u2019s upon us.",
    "The rain fills our narrow beds.",
    "That\u2019s the word."

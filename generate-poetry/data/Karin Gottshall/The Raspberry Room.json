    "It was solid hedge, loops of bramble and thorny",
    "as it had to be with its berries thick as bumblebees.",
    "It drew blood just to get there, but I was queen",
    "of that place, at ten, though the berries shook like fists",
    "in the wind, daring anyone to come in. I was trying",
    "so hard to love this world\u2014real rooms too big and full",
    "of worry to comfortably inhabit\u2014but believing I was born",
    "to live in that cloistered green bower: the raspberry patch",
    "in the back acre of my grandparents\u2019 orchard. I was cross-",
    "stitched and beaded by its fat, dollmaker\u2019s needles. The effort",
    "of sliding under the heavy, spiked tangles that tore",
    "my clothes and smeared me with juice was rewarded",
    "with space, wholly mine, a kind of room out of",
    "the crush of the bushes with a canopy of raspberry",
    "dagger-leaves and a syrup of sun and birdsong.",
    "Hours would pass in the loud buzz of it, blood",
    "made it mine\u2014the adventure of that red sting singing",
    "down my calves, the place the scratches brought me to:",
    "just space enough for a girl to lie down."

    "Sometimes I say I\u2019m going to meet my sister at the cafe\u0301\u2014",
    "even though I have no sister\u2014just because it\u2019s such",
    "a beautiful thing to say. I\u2019ve always thought so, ever since",
    "I read a novel in which two sisters were constantly meeting",
    "in cafe\u0301s. Today, for example, I walked alone",
    "on the wet sidewalk, wearing my rain boots, expecting",
    "someone might ask where I was headed. I bought",
    "a steno pad and a watch battery, the store windows",
    "fogged up. Rain in April is a kind of promise, and it costs",
    "nothing. I carried a bag of books to the cafe\u0301 and ordered",
    "tea. I like a place that\u2019s lit by lamps. I like a place",
    "where you can hear people talk about small things,",
    "like the difference between azure and cerulean,",
    "and the price of tulips. It\u2019s going down. I watched",
    "someone who could be my sister walk in, shaking the rain",
    "from her hair. I thought, even now florists are filling",
    "their coolers with tulips, five dollars a bundle. All over",
    "the city there are sisters. Any one of them could be mine."

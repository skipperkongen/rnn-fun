    "They walk past you",
    "weeping",
    "for the leaves that burnt",
    "& fell, the wood exposed",
    "like bone, sculpture",
    "that suddenly emerges",
    "from white haze.",
    "You old fortune-teller,",
    "you could have told them",
    "in their vibrant grief",
    "whispering through the night wind",
    "your breath held in your heart",
    "like the trembling promise of tomorrow,",
    "just before dawn",
    "there was no pain",
    "you are the wood",
    "not the leaf,",
    "falling is not",
    "falling but",
    "offering."

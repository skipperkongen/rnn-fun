    "It was the sort of thing given to little girls:",
    "sturdy and small, round edged, wooden and light.",
    "I stalked the pasture\u2019s rough and waist-high grass",
    "for worthy specimens: the belle amid the mass,",
    "the star shaming the clouds of slighter,",
    "ordinary blooms. The asters curled",
    "inside my sweat-damp palms, as if in sleep. Crushed",
    "in the parlor\u2019s stifling heat, I pried",
    "each shrinking petal back, and turned the screws.",
    "But flowers bear no ugly bruise,",
    "and even now fall from the brittle page, dried",
    "prettily, plucked from memory\u2019s hush."

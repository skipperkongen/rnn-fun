    "Particulate as ash, new year's first snow falls",
    "upon peaked roofs, car hoods, undulant hills,",
    "in imitation of motion that moves the way",
    "static cascades down screens when the cable",
    "zaps out, persistent & granular with a flicker",
    "of legibility that dissipates before it can be",
    "interpolated into any succession of imagery.",
    "One hour stretches sixty minutes into a field",
    "of white flurry: hexagonal lattices of water",
    "molecules that accumulate in drifts too soon",
    "strewn with sand, hewn into browning",
    "mounds by plow blade, left to turn to slush."

    "In the south, sleeping against",
    "the drugstore, growling under",
    "the trucks and stoves, stumbling",
    "through and over the cluttered eyes",
    "of early mysterious night. Frowning",
    "drunk waving moving a hand or lash.",
    "Dancing kneeling reaching out, letting",
    "a hand rest in shadows. Squatting",
    "to drink or pee. Stretching to climb",
    "pulling themselves onto horses near",
    "where there was sea (the old songs",
    "lead you to believe). Riding out",
    "from this town, to another, where",
    "it is also black. Down a road",
    "where people are asleep. Towards",
    "the moon or the shadows of houses.",
    "Towards the songs\u2019 pretended sea."

    "A real one wouldn't need one,",
    "but the one Nathan draws surely does:",

    "green apple, toasted coconut and grape,",
    "flanked, two per side, by billowing valentine hearts,",
    "in a frame of Scotch tape.",
    "Alive, it could stay off the floor,",
    "for a few unaerodynamic minutes;",
    "thrown as a paper airplane, for one or two more.",
    "Very sensibly, therefore,",
    "our son gave it something, not to keep it apart",
    "from the ground forever, but rather to make safe its descent.",
    "When we ask that imagination discover the limits",
    "of the real",
    "world only slowly,",
    "maybe this is what we meant."

    "Somehow I am sturdier, more shore",

    "give earthquake to all architecture.",

    "You put that sugar",
    "in the melon\u2019s breath, and it is wet",
    "with what you are. (I, too, ferment.)",
    "You rub the hum and simple warmth",
    "of summer from afar into the hips",
    "of insects and of everything.",
    "I can forget.",
    "And like the sea,",
    "one more machine without a memory,",
    "I don\u2019t believe that you made me.",
    "I don\u2019t believe that you made me",
    "into this tremolo of hands,",
    "this fever, this flat-footed dance",
    "of tendons and the drapery",
    "of skin along a skeleton.",
    "I am that I am: a brittle",
    "rib cage and the hummingbird",
    "of breath that flickers in it.",
    "Incrementally, I stand:",
    "in me are eons and the cramp",
    "of endless ancestry.",
    "Sun is in the leaves again.",
    "I think I see you in the wind",
    "but then I think I see the wind."

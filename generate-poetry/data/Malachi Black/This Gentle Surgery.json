    "glides almost too easily through me,",
    "and from the scuffle I\u2019ve been sutured to",
    "some flap of me is freed: I am severed",
    "like a simile: an honest tenor",
    "trembling toward the vehicle I mean",
    "to be: a blackbird licking half notes",
    "from the muscled, sap-damp branches",
    "of the sugar maple tree",
    "a part of any part of every particle",
    "of me, though I\u2019ll be softly reconstructed",
    "by the white gloves of metonymy,",
    "I grieve: there is no feeling in a cut",
    "that doesn\u2019t heal a bit too much."

    "each morning. Unfasten all the bones",
    "that make a head, and let me rest: unknown",
    "among the oboe-throated geese gone south",
    "to drop their down and sleep beside the out-",
    "that isn\u2019t anxious as a phone",
    "about to ring. Give me some doubt",
    "on loan; give me a way to get away",
    "from what I know. I pace until the sun",
    "is in my window. I lie down. I\u2019m a coal:",
    "I smolder to a bloodshot glow. Each day",
    "I die down in my bed of snow, undone",
    "by my red mind and what it woke."

    "Like in a film",
    "thoughts of you unfold",
    "moment by moment.",
    "I vaguely hear",
    "the sound of your spoon scooping cereal",
    "the water stream in the shower",
    "the buzzing noise of your electric razor",
    "like a singing of cicada.",
    "Your footsteps in and out of the bedroom.",
    "Your lips touching my cheek lightly.",
    "And the sound of the door shutting.",
    "In your light",
    "I fall asleep again under the warm quilt",
    "happily like a child.",
    "Upon waking",
    "on the kitchen counter I find a half",
    "grapefruit carefully cut and sectioned.",
    "Such a loving touch is a milestone",
    "for my newly found happiness."

    "October, and the leaves turned late but strong.",
    "Rock maples and the reds, clear brazen, blaze",
    "long-burning feats of sugar through our ways.",
    "Their strident hold upon the back roads pulls",
    "our morning drive, out to where Oak Woods Road",
    "crosses the river that they call Great Works.",
    "The nearby fields so rich it\u2019s hard to breathe\u2014",
    "the hay treacly with auburn, grasses bronzed\u2014",
    "we stop before a red farmhouse, just shy",
    "of where the river runs, where maple trees",
    "have laid the front lawns ravished with their loss.",
    "From Booker\u2019s truck we pull out sacks and tools,",
    "proceed to gather up the autumn\u2019s spoils.",
    "He holds each big bag open, and I rake",
    "the broad red leaves together and inside.",
    "The crop is so much greater than our work",
    "could ever capture, even as we press",
    "it in, right close, to fill October\u2019s urge,",
    "but we have cleared a windfall just the same:",
    "A clarity, the season\u2019s morning hues,",
    "and our sweet chore have worked an art of fall.",
    "As autumn and the Great Works trickle by,",
    "we skim as much brimmed crimson as these few",
    "stout bags will hold within, enough to lay",
    "four inches of the fall upon his fields.",
    "October's task has raked the colors high.",
    "To turn 'em in, the soil to bed with yield,",
    "is just as good as planting winter rye."

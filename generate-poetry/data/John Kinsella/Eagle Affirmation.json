    "You\u2019ve got to understand that sighting the pair",
    "of eagles over the block, right over our house,",
    "not more than twenty feet above the roof,",
    "so massive their wings pull at the corrugated",
    "tin sheeting even with gentlest tilt, counteracts",
    "bitterness against all the damage I see and hear",
    "around me on an exclusively crisp blue morning,",
    "when clarity is pain and even one small missing",
    "wattle tree, entirely vanquished since I was last here",
    "at home\u2014I still find this hard to say\u2014is agony;",
    "a region is not a pinpoint and a different compass",
    "works in my head, having magnetics for all",
    "directions and all pointing to one spot",
    "I know and observe as closely as possible;",
    "and even one small vanished or vanquished",
    "wattle tree is agony close to death for me,",
    "where I find it hard to breathe to feed myself",
    "to get past the loss; but the pair of eagles",
    "still appearing and keeping their sharp",
    "and scrupulous eyes honed, overrides",
    "this ordeal, though I wish their victims",
    "life too and their damage is traumatic",
    "as anything else; that\u2019s as much sense",
    "or nonsense as I can make in such blue light."

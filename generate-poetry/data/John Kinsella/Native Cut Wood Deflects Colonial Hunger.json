    "The guilt of cut wood? Its smell, its bloody show?",
    "And that colorist\u2019s jam envy, the lust for ropes",
    "of raspberry. Fence-posts sturdy and hardy",
    "and doused in creosote: to stand alone",
    "in Termitesville. The sweetness turns rust.",

    "So overwhelmingly familiar to me.",
    "No Old Country raspberry homesickness.",
    "Just an inkling of anthocyanin pigments.",

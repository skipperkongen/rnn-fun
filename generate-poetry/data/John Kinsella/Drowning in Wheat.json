    "They\u2019d been warned",
    "on every farm",
    "that playing",
    "in the silos",

    "Slowly. And the more",
    "you struggle the worse it gets.",

    "your face, nimble on its turf,",
    "and then you\u2019ll disappear.\u2019",
    "In there, hard work",
    "has no reward.",
    "So it became a kind of test",
    "to see how far they could sink",
    "without needing a rope",
    "to help them out.",
    "But in the midst of play",
    "rituals miss a beat\u2014like both",
    "leaping in to resolve",
    "an argument",
    "as to who\u2019d go first",
    "and forgetting",
    "to attach the rope.",
    "Up to the waist",
    "and afraid to move.",
    "That even a call for help",
    "would see the wheat",
    "trickle down.",
    "The painful consolidation",
    "of time. The grains",
    "in the hourglass",
    "grotesquely swollen.",
    "And that acrid",
    "chemical smell",
    "of treated wheat",
    "coaxing them into",
    "a near-dead sleep."

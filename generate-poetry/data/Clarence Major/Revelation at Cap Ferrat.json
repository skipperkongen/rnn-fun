    "It\u2019s not solely the dance",
    "of the juggler but his spirit:",
    "with its turkey wings, perfect thighs,",
    "sensuous hips, large round flat eye.",
    "This eye smiles like lips.",
    "Watch this eye\u2014",
    "it\u2019s not a donkey eye.",
    "It\u2019s not solely the dancer",
    "who moves like a circus animal",
    "as though to children\u2019s music\u2014no,",
    "it\u2019s the girl in the swing\u2019s rhythm,",
    "the ticking of the clock at night,",
    "the strut of the cock, the flight",
    "of the holy family to the remains.",
    "The nipple that feeds",
    "the infant is an eye looking",
    "into his future.",
    "It\u2019s not even the village square",
    "with its musicians and happy faces",
    "that makes the difference\u2014no,",
    "because if it were, weddings",
    "with violins, harps, flutes",
    "would have settled the question:",
    "no, it is the rising and lifting,",
    "the failing and catching of",
    "that unknown sense of self",
    "before it crashes, that matters."

    "After lockdown, tier by tier undresses to sleep:",
    "Each skull nestles in its mattress-hollow.",
    "Wall facing wall inside of wall shrinks to a keyhole:",
    "A fly creeps through and starts to buzz, reeling through bars",
    "Down steel corridors. A dreamer\u2019s eye follows the fly,",
    "And wherever the fly lands, the eye touches down",
    "With an airier Midas touch that turns all to glass:",
    "The eye wakes to Bentham\u2019s panopticon, glazed cage",
    "Of an inspection house where only the Warden sees all.",
    "\u2014I am asleep and not asleep,",
    "I stare up into faces swarming:",
    "Cellblocks of memory focus face by face,",
    "Mine flitting in and out of theirs: In prison issue",
    "They come, footsteps mingling over mine in a child\u2019s game",
    "Of chase from yard to cell, only we\u2019re all grown men,",
    "Meatier, less and more malign than",
    "A boy\u2019s imagining himself grown...",
    "\u2014I was asleep and not asleep,",
    "Faces came and went.",
    "Frank the Joker, the West Virginia biker, who composed",
    "\u201cA rhyme to fit the crime\u201d:",
    "\u201cThere was a young fellow named Frank",
    "Who gave his girlfriend a spank;",
    "She fell in a heap",
    "In front of Frank\u2019s jeep",
    "And old Frank ran her down for a prank.\u201d",
    "Or the white-haired lifer, densley oracular:",
    "\u201cSometimes, after lockdown, your thoughts",
    "Just don\u2019t have the energy to climb the wall.\u201d",
    "The Giggler who bolted",
    "His brother in a barn and burned it down,",
    "Eyes challenging, sly:",
    "\u201cThey killed this guy and see, I think this is funny, hilarious",
    "In fact, but you, you won\u2019t think so\u2014they cut off his dick",
    "And shoved it in his mouth.\u201d",
    "Or the child molester who said about flowers",
    "At funerals: \u201cThey\u2019re there, aren\u2019t they,",
    "To hide the stink off the corpse?\u201d",
    "Or Pat, armed robber",
    "Who held aloof: Rolled shirtsleeves, forearms",

    "Three o\u2019clock dark dissolves",
    "The walls, faces start to drift, their atoms",
    "Mix with concrete\u2019s",
    "Atomic swirl, bodies get stuck",
    "Floating halfway through, heartbeats",
    "Booming as through a stethoscope:",
    "Like Michaelangelo\u2019s slaves, if a fly",
    "Landed on their noses,",
    "They couldn\u2019t lift a hand to brush it off.",
    "Dark velleities buzz in this hive of steel",

    "As in the horror movie",
    "that, circuitry and test-tubes",
    "Sparking, would unscramble these divided",
    "Natures?",
    "(They called me \u201cTeach\u201d",

    "Their side of the wall was theirs, not mine.)",
    "\u2014I tried to turn over, to look away,",
    "But couldn\u2019t wake up, couldn\u2019t not wake.",

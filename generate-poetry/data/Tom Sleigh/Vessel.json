    "Branching the way blind fingers splay across",
    "The face they\u2019re reading, trees trace the backyard",
    "Ditch sop that their shadows drop off into",
    "Space,",
    "an abyss where I hear a neighbor boy\u2019s",
    "Voice cursing an exhilarated, out of its mind,",
    "Unappeasably inventive flow of",
    "\u201cFuck fuck motherfuck\u201d ecstasy that maybe",
    "He imagines the neighborhood can't hear?\u2014",
    "or is his tongue wired",
    "To some source of inspired but as yet unknown",
    "Intelligence that radiates from all of us and he",
    "Is its mouthpiece, speaking it to the trees",
    "That screen him from me listening to his",
    "Unrelenting arias, predestined like birdsong",
    "Flowing unbidden, of four-letter almost",
    "Erotic keening over something I know too,",
    "Everybody knows?\u2014",
    "and even if all it is",
    "Is the \u201cfuck fuck motherfuck\u201d ecstasy",
    "Of April budding in his mouth and sending down",
    "Roots to some anti-self that sprouts and shadows",
    "Him as it croons and shouts the song of its difference\u2014",
    "Even then, this Billy whom I don\u2019t think twice about",
    "When we meet in the alley and slap palms",
    "Or I see him playing alone on the swings of big kids\u2019 slide,",
    "Even then is he the vessel",
    "of some signal that uses us,",
    "Down in the abyss irradiating him so that just this instant",
    "Whatever that other uses him for he can\u2019t resist:",
    "His voice an instrument of blissed-out torment",
    "Until that grip flings him loose\u2014",
    "Who knows which of us it chooses to penetrate",
    "Next, making us suddenly sweat or shiver,",
    "That influence bathing everything budding",
    "in profane rays."

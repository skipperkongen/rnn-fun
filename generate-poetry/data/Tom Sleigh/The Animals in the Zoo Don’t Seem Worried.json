    "Looking at the lion behind the plate glass",
    "I wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking at: a lion, OK,",
    "but he seemed to come apart, not literally",
    "I mean, but I couldn\u2019t see him whole:",
    "Mane. Teeth. The slung belly pumping",
    "as he panted and began to roar. His balls",
    "sheathed in fur swaying a little. His tail\u2019s tuft",
    "jerking in an arc like an old-time pump handle",
    "rusted in midair. Somebody or something",
    "I read once said that when Jesus had his vision",
    "of what his father, God, would do to him,",
    "that Jesus could only see pieces of a cross,",
    "pieces of a body appearing through flashes",
    "of sun, as if the body in his vision",
    "was hands looking for feet, a head for a torso,",
    "everything come unmagnetized from the soul:",
    "the lion caught me in his stare not at",
    "or through me but fixated on the great chain",
    "of being that Jesus couldn\u2019t see and that",
    "a zebra might gallop in \u2014 black and white stripes",
    "marking longitudes of this world turning",
    "to meat, bloody meat \u2014 this vision of an inmate",
    "that Jesus\u2019s father helped to orchestrate by",
    "making a cageless cage with glass instead",
    "of bars \u2014 though the lion didn\u2019t seem to care,",
    "he was roaring for his keepers to bring",
    "him food, so everything\u2019s what it should be",
    "if you\u2019re a lion. Nor did the sea lion",
    "seem concerned about having gone a little",
    "crazy, barking incessantly so I could see",
    "the plush, hot pink insides of its throat,",
    "though like the lion through the glass",
    "there\u2019s this distortion, my reflection",
    "I\u2019m looking through that makes me float above",
    "the zoo: and now this silence at closing time",
    "pours like a waterfall in different zones",
    "of silences that, pouring through my head,",
    "surround roaring, barking, human muttering \u2014",
    "is any of that what being sounds like?",
    "Or is it just animal gasping like what",
    "Jesus must have heard from the thieves",
    "hanging beside him, one damned, one saved?",
    "What was in his heart when his vision",
    "clarified and he saw it was a hand he",
    "recognized that the nail was driving through?"

    "Foresees: Ten years ago, was it, when we",
    "Walked that shore, too earnest and sheepish",
    "To hold hands? The wind cutting through our clothes",
    "Cleansed and burned, the chill off the Atlantic",
    "An ache we courted in our dumbstruck talk:",
    "Callow, expectant, what wouldn\u2019t love give?",
    "Cavalcanti\u2019s ray from Mars, Dante\u2019s wheel that moves",
    "The planets and the stars, how nervous",
    "We were, awkward and shivering: \u201cLike this,",
    "Do you like it like this?\u201d Up all night,",
    "Then waking to the smell of flannel and sweat,",
    "We lay grateful, winded, goosefleshed in the chill,",
    "Our own atmosphere rich and breathable:",
    "We drank round the clock, embracing extremes,",
    "Too hurried and heartsore to think of time\u2026",
    "Out fishing after midnight, we watched schools of squid",
    "Slide and shimmer, tentacles tight-wrapped",
    "Around our gig\u2019s hooks: Yanked from the water,",
    "They spouted jets of ink, then pulsed and quivered",
    "And faded to dead-white, their eyes, resigned and sober,",
    "Opening wider and wider\u2026Ten years more,",
    "And will either of us remember",
    "That ink sticky on our hands, the moon-glare",
    "Rippling as we knelt underneath the pier",
    "And scrubbed and scrubbed our hands in the dark water?",

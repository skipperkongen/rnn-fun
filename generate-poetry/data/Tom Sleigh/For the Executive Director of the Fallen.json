    "The little boy crying out",
    "in self-panicking delight,",
    "waving his little cock",
    "under the banner",
    "of the sun, seemed pure Blake,",
    "all anarchy and energy,",
    "an innocence unfrightened",
    "of itself that shook the lake's",
    "waters and unsettled",
    "the strained composures",
    "and appointed certainties",
    "of whatever Absolute Speaker",
    "had been ranting in my brain:",
    "\u2014",
    "so many demon faces",
    "in the glass city.",
    "Each pubic triangle",
    "seemed, under the bathing suits,",
    "to grow electrical and crackle",
    "with a sexual shock",
    "that made me turn my face away:",
    "and who should be there",
    "but you, my dear Lord of Misrule,",
    "blowing smoke in all our faces,",
    "the clean bullet hole in your forehead",
    "above your self-ironic smile:",
    "stop typing\u2014",
    "and after I swam",
    "and I was sitting on the bank,",
    "after the boy and his parents",
    "had packed up and gone home,",
    "I played the Noh play over for you",
    "in the tape loop of the void",
    "where your voice and laughter",
    "so casually reside:",
    "how the mother",
    "gone searching for her",
    "missing son finds him dancing",
    "by the lake, and as she tries",
    "to hold him he slips through",
    "her arms just as she slips",
    "through his arms\u2014",
    "and as she cries out",
    "in perfect pitch in perfect time",
    "to the shrieking bamboo flute",
    "that her boy has drowned",
    "she understands that she too",
    "has drowned, that she too",
    "is a ghost returning",
    "to dance as they",
    "dance together in a tighter",
    "and tighter round."

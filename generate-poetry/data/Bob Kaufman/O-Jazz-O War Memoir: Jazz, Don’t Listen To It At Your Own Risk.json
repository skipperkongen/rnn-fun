    "While jazz blew in the night",
    "Suddenly they were too busy to hear a simple sound",
    "They were busy shoving mud in men\u2019s mouths,",

    "Listening to jazz, with so many important things going on",
    "But even the fittest murderers must rest",
    "So they sat down in our blood soaked garments,",
    "and listened to jazz",

    "They were indignant at the whistling, thinking, singing, beating,",
    "swinging,",
    "They wept for it, hugged, kissed it, loved it, joined it, we drank it,",
    "Smoked it, ate with it, slept with it",
    "They made our girls wear it for lovemaking",
    "Instead of silly lace gowns,",
    "Now in those terrible moments, when the dark memories come",
    "The secret moments to which we admit no one",
    "When guiltily we crawl back in time, reaching away from ourselves",
    "They hear a familiar sound,",
    "Jazz, scratching, digging, blueing, swinging jazz,",
    "And listen,",
    "And feel, & die."

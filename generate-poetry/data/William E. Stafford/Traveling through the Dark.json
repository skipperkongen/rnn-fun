    "Traveling through the dark I found a deer",
    "dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.",
    "It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:",
    "that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.",
    "By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car",
    "and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;",
    "she had stiffened already, almost cold.",
    "I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.",
    "My fingers touching her side brought me the reason\u2014",
    "her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,",
    "alive, still, never to be born.",
    "Beside that mountain road I hesitated.",
    "The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;",
    "under the hood purred the steady engine.",
    "I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;",
    "around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.",
    "I thought hard for us all\u2014my only swerving\u2014,",
    "then pushed her over the edge into the river."

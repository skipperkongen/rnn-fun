    "At noon in the desert a panting lizard",
    "waited for history, its elbows tense,",
    "watching the curve of a particular road",
    "as if something might happen.",
    "It was looking at something farther off",
    "than people could see, an important scene",
    "acted in stone for little selves",
    "at the flute end of consequences.",
    "There was just a continent without much on it",
    "under a sky that never cared less.",
    "Ready for a change, the elbows waited.",
    "The hands gripped hard on the desert."

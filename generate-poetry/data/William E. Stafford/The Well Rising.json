    "The well rising without sound,",
    "the spring on a hillside,",
    "the plowshare brimming through deep ground",
    "everywhere in the field\u2014",
    "The sharp swallows in their swerve",
    "flaring and hesitating",
    "hunting for the final curve",
    "coming closer and closer\u2014",
    "The swallow heart from wingbeat to wingbeat",
    "counseling decision, decision:",
    "thunderous examples. I place my feet",
    "with care in such a world."

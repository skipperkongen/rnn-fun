    "We wondered what our walk should mean,",
    "taking that un-march quietly;",
    "the sun stared at our signs\u2014 \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d",
    "Men by a tavern said, \u201cThose foreigners . . .\u201d",
    "to a woman with a fur, who turned away\u2014",
    "like an elevator going down, their look at us.",
    "Along a curb, their signs lined across,",
    "a picket line stopped and stared",
    "the whole width of the street, at ours: \u201cUnfair.\u201d",
    "Above our heads the sound truck blared\u2014",
    "by the park, under the autumn trees\u2014",
    "it said that love could fill the atmosphere:",
    "Occur, slow the other fallout, unseen,",
    "on islands everywhere\u2014fallout, falling",
    "unheard. We held our poster up to shade our eyes.",
    "At the end we just walked away;",
    "no one was there to tell us where to leave the signs."

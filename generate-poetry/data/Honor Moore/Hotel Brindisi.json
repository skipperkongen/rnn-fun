    "He asked me to take his hands.",
    "They are cold, he said.",
    "I warmed his cold hands",
    "as we sat on the rouge banquette.",
    "It was the last May of the century.",
    "His eyes looked at my face.",
    "His hand fell to the glacier",
    "of my thigh and held on.",
    "My gold tail swam dark green water,",
    "the ocean smelled of gardenia.",
    "Outside on the avenue people",
    "scurried to their palaces, wearing",
    "sunglasses, carrying shiny bags."

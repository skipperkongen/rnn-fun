    "JC was called the Rack",
    "at the work farm,",
    "aluminum milk pails",
    "dangling from his hands.",
    "Once a sudden fist",
    "crushed the cartilage of nose",
    "across his face,",
    "but JC only grinned,",
    "and the man with the fist",
    "stumbled away.",
    "JC sings his work farm songs on the street,",
    "swaying with black overcoat and guitar,",
    "cigarettes cheaper than food.",
    "But today he promises",
    "four sandwiches, two for each of us.",
    "The landlady, a Rumanian widow,",
    "has nailed a death mask",
    "over JC\u2019s bed,",
    "sleeping plaster face",
    "of a drowned girl",
    "peaceful in the dark.",
    "As the girl contemplates water",
    "and pigeons batter the window,",
    "JC spreads the last deviled ham",
    "on two slices of bread,",
    "presses them together,",
    "then slowly tears four pieces.",
    "\u201cHere,\u201d he almost sings,",

    "Such are the little memories of you;",
    "They come and go, return and lie apart",
    "From all main things of life; yet more than they,",
    "With noiseless feet, they come and grip the heart.",
    "Gay laughter leading quick and stormy tears,",
    "Then smiles again and pulse of flying feet,",
    "In breathless chase of fleeting gossamers,",
    "Are memories so dear, so bitter-sweet.",
    "No more are echoes of your flying feet.",
    "Hard by, where Pike\u2019s Peak rears its head in state,",
    "The erstwhile rushing feet, with halting steps,",
    "For health\u2019s return in Denver watch and wait.",
    "But love and memories of noiseless tread,",
    "Where angels hovered once, all shining fair,",
    "To tuck you in your little trundle bed,",
    "Kneel nightly now in agony of prayer."

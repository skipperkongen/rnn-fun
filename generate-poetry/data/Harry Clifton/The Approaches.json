    "A childless, futureless road",
    "And then nothing. . . Is that it?",
    "Or start believing in a God",
    "Beyond the temporal limit",
    "Of westering skies, wide, melancholy,",
    "Uncut fields and paced-out walls",
    "As we drive towards it slowly,",
    "The house that has us both in thrall.",
    "They are gone, now, the hours of light",
    "It took to get here. Might-have-beens,",
    "Lost wanderyears. But that's alright\u2014",
    "We are trading it in, the seen",
    "For the experienced, the car keys",
    "For the end of the journey,",
    "When distances have lost their power",
    "And the heart beats slower",
    "In tomorrow's cold, a coming weather",
    "One degree north of yesterday.",
    "High latitudes\u2014as they say,",
    "There is nothing up here",
    "But wind and silence, passing clouds,",
    "Light diminished half a tone,",
    "A dish left out all night for the gods",
    "By morning turned to stone.",
    "So take a right, go down two gears",
    "And stay in second, where the church is",
    "And the pig farm. Only the approaches",
    "Are terrible, only the years,",
    "The getting here, which takes forever.",
    "A boy in tears, a barren crone",
    "On a bicycle, a man alone\u2014",
    "They're waving. . . It's now or never",
    "For the final self, I assume\u2014",
    "For the shape of the house",
    "On the skyline, the release",
    "Into childhood, and the coming home."

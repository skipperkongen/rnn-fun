    "the faces smashed first in little ways before",
    "the long drop, an eye or an ear broken, a mouth snapped",
    "in half. Then, lifted from the well, two thousand years",
    "later, still grinning and golden. The loose spooling of two",
    "people fast unravels\u2014how we let go of time spent,",
    "how heat fades, how a body forgets fully what it knew.",
    "I have learned your face as you will never.",
    "The third day we met you gave me all your secrets",
    "until I held an ocean in a cradle. Now all I ask for is more."

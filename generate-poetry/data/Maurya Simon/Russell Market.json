    "What I want most is what I deeply fear:",
    "loss of self; yet here I stand, a \u201cmemsahib,\u201d",
    "all decked out in wonder, and still a stranger",
    "amid the harvest, old gaffar at my side.",
    "Here\u2019s a pandit preaching in the flower stall:",
    "he turns funeral wreaths into wheels of rapture.",
    "I must shrug off my notion of knowing anything",
    "of substance about the world, about the spirit.",
    "Sparrows dart between the columns like music.",
    "Huge pupae, bananas split their golden skins;",
    "flies moisten their hands in bands of dew.",
    "Lepers limp by on crutches, in slow motion.",
    "Where is there order in the world? None,",
    "none, I think\u2014no order, only spirals of power.",
    "The pyramids of onion, guava, melon\u2014all defy",
    "my reason: they shine like galaxy-driven planets.",
    "A balancing scale becomes a barge of plenty,",
    "a cornucopia endlessly filling up and emptying.",
    "The wages of sin are more sin: virtue\u2019s wages,",
    "more virtue\u2014and all such earnings, weightless.",
    "I\u2019ve forgotten my errand; I float now through",
    "myself like a howl through a phantom mouth\u2014",
    "the world\u2019s an illusory marketplace where I",
    "must bargain hardest for what I hope I\u2019m worth."

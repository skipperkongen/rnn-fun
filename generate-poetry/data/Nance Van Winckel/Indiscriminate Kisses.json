    "Foreplay of obscene graffiti carved",
    "into trees\u0097foot-long boners",
    "gouge the bark. Beaks and snouts",
    "on a restroom mirror. Slick lips.",
    "Succulent lips. I go out among them",
    "sometimes. So sweet how they pucker up",
    "out of pity. A practiced pathos",
    "in a saloon of woodsmen whose axes",
    "wait in trucks out back. Lips full of yawn",
    "or yes. Lips thick with God-spit",
    "and God-suck. Chapped lips, bloody lips.",
    "Pierced or tattooed, they pout",
    "into view\u0097here to give, willy-nilly,",
    "what's been too long held in the body.",
    "Something passes across tongues. It sayeth not",
    "a name; it taketh everyone's turn. Mute lips",
    "of a swift unbuttoner. Mouths fording",
    "frothy streams, vaporous bogs.",
    "I stumble forth in their midst. Maybe",
    "I am out of bread or in a bad place",
    "with a book. The streets have an attendant",
    "caress. Moon lapping rumor. Fat lip",
    "approaches hare lip. There go pasty",
    "lips. All are readied as if for a race",
    "or to be plucked like rare moths",
    "by bright wings from the air. Betty's lips",
    "and Bobby's and Bucky's just before the collision",
    "and the siren's red wail. Laddy, keep",
    "a light on. I may have to come ashore",
    "some distance from where I set in."

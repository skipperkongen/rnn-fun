    "They asked me to climb a ladder",
    "I did not want to climb a ladder",
    "But they forced me to climb the ladder",
    "If you don\u2019t climb the ladder",
    "we will bury you in the foamy mud",
    "I had to decide: should I die",
    "by hanging or by burial",
    "I climbed the ladder and they wrapped",
    "a belt around the thick limb of a tree",
    "And then when I could no longer breathe",
    "they tossed me into a stream",
    "And I floated to the edge of the village",
    "where someone prayed for my soul",
    "It\u2019s like this in a lullaby",
    "for the end of the world:",
    "The options for the end",
    "are endless",
    "But this is not really a lullaby",
    "for the end of the world",
    "It\u2019s about the beginning",
    "what happens when we start to rot",
    "in the daylight",
    "The way the light shines on",
    "the ants and worms and parasites",
    "mauling our bodies",
    "It\u2019s about the swarms of dogs",
    "gnawing our skin and bones",
    "Do you know what it\u2019s like",
    "when a ghost licks your intestines",
    "Do you know what it\u2019s like",
    "when a rat devours your brain",
    "To avoid the hole",
    "the children must sing sweetly, softly",
    "To avoid the hole",
    "they must fill their songs with love"

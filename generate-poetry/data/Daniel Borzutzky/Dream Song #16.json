    "They sniffed us out of the holes with the animals",
    "they had programmed and there are blows in life so",
    "powerful we just don\u2019t know and there were trenches",
    "and there was water and it poured in through our mouths",
    "and out of our ears and there were things we saw in the",
    "sand at that moment of sinking: mountains and daisies",
    "and tulips and rivers and the bodies of the people we",
    "had been and the bodies of the people we had loved",
    "and we felt hooks coming through the trenches and we",
    "felt hooks coming through the sand and I saw hooks coming",
    "through my child\u2019s clothes and I wanted him to know that they",
    "would never be able to scoop us out of the sand but of course",
    "it wasn\u2019t true they had scooped us out of the sand and our",
    "mouths were so full of dirt it is what they do when you\u2019re",
    "dead and they made us spit and they beat us until our mouths",
    "were empty and they paid us for constructing the mountain and",
    "it was me and L and we looked for S and we looked for J and J",
    "and we looked for O and we looked for R and we looked for J",
    "and S in the holes in which the bodies of those we loved were",
    "hiding or dying or sinking or stealing some shelter some little",
    "worm\u2019s worth of cover to keep their bodies from dissolving",
    "into the maniac murmurs of this impossible carcass economy"

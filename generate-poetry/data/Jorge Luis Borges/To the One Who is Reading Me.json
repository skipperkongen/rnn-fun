    "You are invulnerable. Didn\u2019t they deliver",
    "(those forces that control your destiny)",
    "the certainty of dust? Couldn\u2019t it be",
    "your irreversible time is that river",
    "in whose bright mirror Heraclitus read",
    "his brevity? A marble slab is saved",
    "for you, one you won\u2019t read, already graved",
    "with city, epitaph, dates of the dead.",
    "And other men are also dreams of time,",
    "not hardened bronze, purified gold. They\u2019re dust",
    "like you; the universe is Proteus.",
    "Shadow, you\u2019ll travel to what waits ahead,",
    "the fatal shadow waiting at the rim.",
    "Know this: in some way you\u2019re already dead."

    "Music of Japan. Parsimoniously",
    "from the water clock the drops unfold",
    "in lazy honey or ethereal gold",
    "that over time reiterates a weave",
    "eternal, fragile, enigmatic, bright.",
    "I fear that every one will be the last.",

    "But from what shrine, from what mountain\u2019s slight",
    "garden, what vigils by an unknown sea,",
    "and from what modest melancholy, from",
    "what lost and rediscovered afternoon",
    "do they arrive at their far future: me?",
    "Who knows? No matter. When I hear it play",
    "I am. I want to be. I bleed away."

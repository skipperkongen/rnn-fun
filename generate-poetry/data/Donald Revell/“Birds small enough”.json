    "Are physicians to us",
    "They burst from the tree exactly",
    "Where the mind ends and the eye sees",
    "Another world the equal of this one",
    "Though only a small boy naked in the sun",
    "Glad day glad day I was born",
    "Sparrow hatted old New York",
    "And the physician who brought me",
    "Drowned under sail next day in a calm sea",
    "There are birds small enough to live forever",
    "Where the mind ends and where",
    "My love and I once planted a cypress",
    "Which is God to us"

    "It has never been so easy to cry",
    "openly or to acknowledge children.",
    "Never before could I walk directly",
    "to the center of an island city",
    "feeling the automatism of millions",
    "drawing one pious breath, shouldering",
    "the sunset, holding it up in the oily",
    "tree-line a while longer. Years ago,",
    "I was never sad enough and nothing",
    "but a hotel that I could tear to pieces",
    "and reconstruct inside a shoebox",
    "felt like home. My parents died. Their miserable",
    "possessions washed up in other hotels,",
    "dioramas of the febrile romantic.",
    "I take my first lover, already",
    "gray at her temples and more reticent",
    "than shy, more tacit than admiring,",
    "to the bus stop by the Jewish Museum.",
    "We wait in the dark a long time.",
    "She does not kiss me. She hurries",
    "up out of the oily street onto the humming,",
    "fluorescent podium of the last bus",
    "where I see her a last time, not waving",
    "to me, not lovable, erect in the freedom",
    "we traduced years ago in our first kiss.",
    "Never deny the power of withdrawal.",
    "Never doubt that thought and time make things small.",
    "Never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed",
    "uncomprehending gesture. At childhood\u2019s end,",
    "none can tell happiness from buoyancy.",
    "None of it made any difference\u2014",
    "the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed,",
    "the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion.",
    "We are no more complicated",
    "than our great-grandparents who dreaded",
    "the hotel life. Like them, we seek the refuge",
    "of warm days in January, a piety",
    "whose compulsion is to survive according",
    "to explicit laws no young woman adores",
    "or young man follows with darling hunger."

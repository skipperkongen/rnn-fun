    "Schliemann is outside, digging. He\u2019s not",
    "not calling a spade a spade.",
    "The stadium where the Greeks once played",
    "used to stand on this very spot.",
    "Each night, Penelope, operating",
    "in mythical time, unspools the light",
    "gray orb Schliemann has just unearthed. Come daylight,",
    "her hands will restitch it. The suitors sigh, waiting.",
    "And each night I\u2019d watch as my hero curled",
    "himself round home plate, as if he were going",
    "to bat for me. And I\u2019d hold my breath, knowing",
    "a strong enough shot might be heard round the world.",
    "One must imagine Penelope.",
    "One must imagine Penelope happy.",
    "One must imagine Schliemann excavating",
    "the dugouts and outfields of Troy, carbon-dating",
    "the box score stats and the ticket stubs",
    "he pulls from the lurid dirt. He rubs",
    "the remains of Achilles\u2019s rage on his shirt.",
    "What does not kill you can still hurt.",
    "Penelope\u2019s suitors are striking out,",
    "one after another. Their sad swings and misses.",
    "They can\u2019t even get to first base. She\u2019ll cut",
    "the stitches once more, then blow them all kisses.",
    "Odysseus won\u2019t care that the orb is undone.",
    "He\u2019ll take a swing at it with all his might.",
    "The ball takes flight. Odysseus takes flight.",
    "It feels to Penelope like he\u2019s been gone",
    "since the dawn of mankind, but he\u2019s already zoomed",
    "round third and flies like an arrow toward home,",
    "as the unearthly orb trails its guts in the air \u2014",
    "the yarn fanning out like Penelope\u2019s hair \u2014",
    "not knowing yet whether to fall foul or fair."

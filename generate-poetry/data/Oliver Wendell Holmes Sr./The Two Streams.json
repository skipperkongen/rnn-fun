    "Behold the rocky wall",
    "That down its sloping sides",
    "Pours the swift rain-drops, blending, as they fall,",
    "In rushing river-tides!",
    "Yon stream, whose sources run",
    "Turned by a pebble\u2019s edge,",
    "Is Athabasca, rolling toward the sun",
    "Through the cleft mountain-ledge.",
    "The slender rill had strayed,",
    "But for the slanting stone,",
    "To evening\u2019s ocean, with the tangled braid",
    "Of foam-flecked Oregon.",
    "So from the heights of Will",
    "Life\u2019s parting stream descends,",
    "And, as a moment turns its slender rill,",
    "Each widening torrent bends,\u2014",
    "From the same cradle\u2019s side,",
    "From the same mother\u2019s knee,\u2014",
    "One to long darkness and the frozen tide,",
    "One to the Peaceful Sea!"

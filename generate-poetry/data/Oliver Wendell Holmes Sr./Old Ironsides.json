    "Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!",
    "Long has it waved on high,",
    "And many an eye has danced to see",
    "That banner in the sky;",
    "Beneath it rung the battle shout,",
    "And burst the cannon\u2019s roar;\u2014",
    "The meteor of the ocean air",
    "Shall sweep the clouds no more!",
    "Her deck, once red with heroes\u2019 blood",
    "Where knelt the vanquished foe,",
    "When winds were hurrying o\u2019er the flood",
    "And waves were white below,",
    "No more shall feel the victor\u2019s tread,",
    "Or know the conquered knee;\u2014",
    "The harpies of the shore shall pluck",
    "The eagle of the sea!",
    "O, better that her shattered hulk",
    "Should sink beneath the wave;",
    "Her thunders shook the mighty deep,",
    "And there should be her grave;",
    "Nail to the mast her holy flag,",
    "Set every thread-bare sail,",
    "And give her to the god of storms,\u2014",
    "The lightning and the gale!"

    "barking furiously.",

    ". . . something.",
    "Instead of a dog barking there was silence,",
    "then the sound of a drum beaten loud & fast",
    "by a young nun.",
    "Into this temple come none of the grand sounds,",
    "none of the great thoughts.",
    "In the cabbage field, heads all the same size",

    "sitting in Unmun Temple.",
    "Young faces",
    "like dew,",
    "like hoarfrost."

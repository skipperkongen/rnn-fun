    "Amongst dogs are listeners and singers.",
    "My big dog sang with me so purely,",
    "puckering her ruffled lips into an O,",
    "beginning with small, swallowing sounds",
    "like Coltrane musing, then rising to power",
    "and resonance, gulping air to continue\u2014",
    "her passion and sense of flawless form\u2014",
    "singing not with me, but for the art of dogs.",
    "We joined in many fine songs\u2014\"Stardust,\"",
    "\"Naima,\" \"The Trout,\" \"My Rosary,\" \"Perdido.\"",
    "She was a great master and died young,",
    "leaving me with unrelieved grief,",
    "her talents known to only a few.",
    "Now I have a small dog who does not sing,",
    "but listens with discernment, requiring",
    "skill and spirit in my falsetto voice.",
    "I sing her name and words of love",
    "Sometimes she is so moved she turns",
    "to place a paw across her snout,",
    "closes her eyes, sighing like a girl",
    "I held and danced with years ago.",
    "But I am a pretender to dog music.",
    "The true strains rise only from",
    "the rich, red chambers of a canine heart,",
    "these melodies best when the moon is up,",
    "listeners and singers together or",
    "apart, beyond friendship and anger,",
    "far from any human imposter\u2014",
    "ballads of long nights lifting",
    "to starlight, songs of bones, turds,",
    "conquests, hunts, smells, rankings,",
    "things settled long before our birth."

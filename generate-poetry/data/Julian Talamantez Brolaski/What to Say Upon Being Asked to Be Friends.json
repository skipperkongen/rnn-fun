    "Why speak of hate, when I do bleed for love?",
    "Not hate, my love, but Love doth bite my tongue",
    "Till I taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough",
    "So flatter I my fever for the one",
    "For whom I inly mourn, though seem to shun.",
    "A rose is arrows is eros, so what",
    "If I confuse the shade that I\u2019ve become",
    "With winedark substance in a lover\u2019s cup?",
    "But stop my tonguely wound, I\u2019ve bled enough.",
    "If I be fair, or false, or freaked with fear",
    "If I my tongue in lock\u00e8d box immure",
    "Blame not me, for I am sick with love.",
    "Yet would I be your friend most willingly",
    "Since friendship would infect me killingly."

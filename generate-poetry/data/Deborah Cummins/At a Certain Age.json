    "He sits beside his wife who takes the wheel.",
    "Clutching coupons, he wanders the aisles",
    "of Stop & Save. There\u2019s no place he must be,",
    "no clock to punch. Sure,",
    "there are bass in the lake, a balsa model",
    "in the garage, the par-three back nine.",
    "But it\u2019s not the same.",
    "Time the enemy then, the enemy now.",
    "As he points the remote at the screen",
    "or pauses at the window, staring",
    "into the neighbor\u2019s fence but not really seeing it,",
    "he listens to his wife in the kitchen, more amazed",
    "than ever\u2014how women seem to know",
    "what to do. How, with their cycles and timers,",
    "their rolling boils and three-minute eggs,",
    "they wait for something to start. Or stop."

    "Love is a sickness full of woes,",
    "All remedies refusing;",
    "A plant that with most cutting grows,",
    "Most barren with best using.",
    "Why so?",
    "More we enjoy it, more it dies;",
    "If not enjoyed, it sighting cries,",
    "Heigh ho!",
    "Love is a torment of the mind,",
    "A tempest everlasting;",
    "And Jove hath made it of a kind",
    "Not well, not full, nor fasting.",
    "Why so?",
    "More we enjoy it, more it dies;",
    "If not enjoyed, it sighing cries,",
    "Heigh ho!"

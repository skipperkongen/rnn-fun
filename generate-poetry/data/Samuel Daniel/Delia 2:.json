    "Go wailing verse, the infants of my love,",
    "-like, brought forth without a Mother:",
    "Present the image of the cares I prove,",
    "Witness your Father\u2019s grief exceeds all other.",
    "Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds,",
    "With interrupted accents of despair:",
    "A monument that whosoever reads,",
    "May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair.",
    "Say her disdain hath dried up my blood,",
    "And starved you, in succours still denying:",
    "Press to her eyes, importune me some good;",
    "Waken her sleeping pity with your crying.",
    "Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have moved her;",
    "And tell th\u2019unkind, how dearly I have loved her."

    "Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers,",
    "That intimate in vain my chaste desires,",
    "My chaste desires, the ever burning tapers,",
    "Enkindled by her eyes\u2019 celestial fires.",
    "Celestial fires and unrespecting powers,",
    "That deign not view the glory of your might,",
    "In humble lines the work of careful hours,",
    "The sacrifice I offer to her sight.",
    "But since she scorns her own, this rests for me,",
    "I\u2019ll moan my self, and hide the wrong I have:",
    "And so content me that her frowns should be",
    "To my infant style the cradle, and the grave.",
    "What though my self no honor get thereby,",
    "Each bird sings t\u2019herself, and so will I."

    "Let others sing of knights and paladins",
    "In aged accents and untimely words;",
    "Paint shadows in imaginary lines",
    "Which well the reach of their high wits records:",
    "But I must sing of thee, and those fair eyes",
    "Authentic shall my verse in time to come,",
    "When yet th' unborn shall say, \u201cLo where she lies",
    "Whose beauty made him speak that else was dumb.\u201d",
    "These are the arks, the trophies I erect,",
    "That fortify thy name against old age;",
    "And these thy sacred virtues must protect",
    "Against the dark, and time's consuming rage.",
    "Though th' error of my youth they shall discover,",
    "Suffice they show I liv'd and was thy lover."

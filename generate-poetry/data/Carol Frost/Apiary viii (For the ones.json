    "who line the corridors and sit",
    "silent in wheelchairs",
    "before the television with the volume off,",
    "whose cares",
    "are small and gray and infinite,",
    "time as ever to be faced ...",
    "Methuselahs the nurses wash",
    "and dress without haste \u2014",
    "none needed ...",
    "this one has drunk from the poppy-cup",
    "and drowses in her world of dream ...",
    "Heliotrope,",
    "carnations, wakeful violets, and lilies in vases \u2014",
    "masses of flowers \u2014 wrap",
    "the urine-and-antiseptic air in lace ...",
    "Please wake up; it is morning;",
    "robins whistle; the bees dance.",
    "Isn't this other one listening",
    "from her shell of silence,",
    "and shouldn't she smile at the green return",
    "and dappled light through windows?",
    "As earth orbits the corridor",
    "clocks are wound ...",
    "The last hour is a song or wound ...",
    "Except in this corridor \u2014 mother's \u2014",
    "where finity's brainless wind",
    "blows ash, and ash again",
    "blows through their cells:",
    "So much silence, so little to say in the end.)"

    "Pushed prow southerly into the golden wind:",
    "hurt the eyes: gold pelted water: so looked less far away:",
    "plovers huddling on the tide's last piece of shore:",
    "Rise up in brightness: clap wings::",
    "I told myself I'll go where eagles go: if to brimstone:",
    "my wake a narrow river back",
    "to its source in cedar: and when sunlight embers",
    "the shore's soft fleece will be before me."

    "Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?",
    "Thou art more lovely and more temperate:",
    "Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,",
    "And summer\u2019s lease hath all too short a date;",
    "Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,",
    "And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;",
    "And every fair from fair sometime declines,",
    "By chance or nature\u2019s changing course untrimm'd;",
    "But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",
    "Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st;",
    "Nor shall death brag thou wander\u2019st in his shade,",
    "When in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st:",
    "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,",
    "So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

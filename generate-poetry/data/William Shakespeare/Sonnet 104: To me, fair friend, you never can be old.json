    "To me, fair friend, you never can be old,",
    "For as you were when first your eye I eyed,",
    "Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold",
    "Have from the forests shook three summers\u2019 pride,",
    "Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned",
    "In process of the seasons have I seen,",
    "Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,",
    "Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.",
    "Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,",
    "Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;",
    "So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,",
    "Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:",
    "For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:",
    "Ere you were born was beauty\u2019s summer dead."

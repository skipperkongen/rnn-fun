    "When, in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,",
    "I all alone beweep my outcast state,",
    "And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",
    "And look upon myself and curse my fate,",
    "Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",
    "Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,",
    "Desiring this man\u2019s art and that man\u2019s scope,",
    "With what I most enjoy contented least;",
    "Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,",
    "Haply I think on thee, and then my state,",
    "(Like to the lark at break of day arising",
    "From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven\u2019s gate;",
    "For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings",
    "That then I scorn to change my state with kings."

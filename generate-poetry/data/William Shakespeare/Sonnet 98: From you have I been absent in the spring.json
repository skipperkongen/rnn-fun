    "From you have I been absent in the spring,",
    "When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,",
    "Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,",
    "That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.",
    "Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell",
    "Of different flowers in odour and in hue,",
    "Could make me any summer\u2019s story tell,",
    "Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:",
    "Nor did I wonder at the lily\u2019s white,",
    "Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;",
    "They were but sweet, but figures of delight",
    "Drawn after you, \u2013 you pattern of all those.",
    "Yet seem\u2019d it winter still, and, you away,",
    "As with your shadow I with these did play."

    "Under the greenwood tree",

    "No enemy",
    "But winter and rough weather.",
    "And loves to live i' the sun,",
    "Seeking the food he eats,",
    "And pleased with what he gets,",
    "Come hither, come hither, come hither:",
    "Here shall he see",
    "No enemy",
    "But winter and rough weather."

    "Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame",
    "Is lust in action; and till action, lust",
    "Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,",
    "Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,",
    "Enjoyed no sooner but despis\u00e8d straight,",
    "Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had",
    "Past reason hated as a swallowed bait",
    "On purpose laid to make the taker mad;",
    "Mad in pursuit and in possession so,",
    "Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;",
    "A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe;",
    "Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.",
    "All this the world well knows; yet none knows well",
    "To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell."

    "Even as the sun with purple-colour\u2019d face",
    "Had ta\u2019en his last leave of the weeping morn,",
    "Rose-cheek\u2019d Adonis tried him to the chase;",
    "Hunting he lov\u2019d, but love he laugh\u2019d to scorn;",
    "Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,",
    "And like a bold-fac\u2019d suitor \u2018gins to woo him.",
    "\u2018Thrice fairer than myself,\u2019 thus she began,",
    "\u2018The field\u2019s chief flower, sweet above compare,",
    "Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,",
    "More white and red than doves or roses are;",
    "Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,",
    "Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.",
    "\u2018Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,",
    "And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;",
    "If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed",
    "A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:",
    "Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses;",
    "And being set, I\u2019ll smother thee with kisses:",
    "\u2018And yet not cloy thy lips with loath\u2019d satiety,",
    "But rather famish them amid their plenty,",
    "Making them red and pale with fresh variety;",
    "Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:",
    "A summer\u2019s day will seem an hour but short,",
    "Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.\u2019",
    "With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,",
    "The precedent of pith and livelihood,",
    "And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm,",
    "Earth\u2019s sovereign salve to do a goddess good:",
    "Being so enrag\u2019d, desire doth lend her force",
    "Courageously to pluck him from his horse.",
    "Over one arm the lusty courser\u2019s rein",
    "Under her other was the tender boy,",
    "Who blush\u2019d and pouted in a dull disdain,",
    "With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;",
    "She red and hot as coals of glowing fire",
    "He red for shame, but frosty in desire.",
    "The studded bridle on a ragged bough",
    "Nimbly she fastens;--O! how quick is love:--",
    "The steed is stalled up, and even now",
    "To tie the rider she begins to prove:",
    "Backward she push\u2019d him, as she would be thrust,",
    "And govern\u2019d him in strength, though not in lust.",
    "So soon was she along, as he was down,",
    "Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:",
    "Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,",
    "And \u2018gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;",
    "And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,",
    "\u2018If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.\u2019",
    "He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears",
    "Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;",
    "Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs",
    "To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:",
    "He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;",
    "What follows more she murders with a kiss.",
    "Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,",
    "Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,",
    "Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,",
    "Till either gorge be stuff\u2019d or prey be gone;",
    "Even so she kiss\u2019d his brow, his cheek, his chin,",
    "And where she ends she doth anew begin.",
    "Forc\u2019d to content, but never to obey,",
    "Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face;",
    "She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,",
    "And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;",
    "Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers",
    "So they were dewd with such distilling showers.",
    "Look! how a bird lies tangled in a net,",
    "So fasten\u2019d in her arms Adonis lies;",
    "Pure shame and aw\u2019d resistance made him fret,",
    "Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:",
    "Rain added to a river that is rank",
    "Perforce will force it overflow the bank.",
    "Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,",
    "For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;",
    "Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,",
    "\u2018Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale;",
    "Being red she loves him best; and being white,",
    "Her best is better\u2019d with a more delight.",
    "Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;",
    "And by her fair immortal hand she swears,",
    "From his soft bosom never to remove,",
    "Till he take truce with her contending tears,",
    "Which long have rain\u2019d, making her cheeks all wet;",
    "And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.",
    "Upon this promise did he raise his chin",
    "Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,",
    "Who, being look\u2019d on, ducks as quickly in;",
    "So offers he to give what she did crave;",
    "But when her lips were ready for his pay,",
    "He winks, and turns his lips another way.",
    "Never did passenger in summer\u2019s heat",
    "More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.",
    "Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;",
    "She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:",
    "\u2018O! pity,\u2019 \u2018gan she cry, \u2018flint-hearted boy:",
    "\u2018Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?",
    "\u2018I have been woo\u2019d, as I entreat thee now,",
    "Even by the stern and direful god of war,",
    "Whose sinewy neck in battle ne\u2019er did bow,",
    "Who conquers where he comes in every jar;",
    "Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,",
    "And begg\u2019d for that which thou unask\u2019d shalt have.",
    "\u2018Over my altars hath he hung his lance,",
    "His batter\u2019d shield, his uncontrolled crest,",
    "And for my sake hath learn\u2019d to sport and dance",
    "To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;",
    "Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red",
    "Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.",
    "\u2018Thus he that overrul\u2019d I oversway\u2019d,",
    "Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:",
    "Strong-temper\u2019d steel his stronger strength obey\u2019d,",
    "Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.",
    "O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,",
    "For mastering her that foil\u2019d the god of fight.",
    "Touch but my lips with those falr lips of thine,--",
    "Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,--",
    "The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:",
    "What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:",
    "Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;",
    "Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?",
    "\u2018Art thou asham\u2019d to kiss? then wink again,",
    "And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;",
    "Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;",
    "Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:",
    "These blue-vein\u2019d violets whereon we lean",
    "Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.",
    "\u2018The tender spring upon thy tempting lip",
    "Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted:",
    "Make use of time, let not advantage slip;",
    "Beauty within itself should not be wasted:",
    "Fair flowers that are not gather\u2019d in their prime",
    "Rot and consume themselves in little time.",
    "\u2018Were I hard-favour\u2019d, foul, or wrinkled-old,",
    "Ill-nurtur\u2019d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,",
    "O\u2019erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,",
    "Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,",
    "Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;",
    "But having no defects, why dost abhor me?",
    "\u2018Thou canst not see one winkle in my brow;",
    "Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;",
    "My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow;",
    "My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;",
    "My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt.",
    "Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.",
    "\u2018Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,",
    "Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,",
    "Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell\u2019d hair,",
    "Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:",
    "Love is a spirit all compact of fire,",
    "Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.",
    "\u2018Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;",
    "These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;",
    "Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,",
    "From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:",
    "Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be",
    "That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?",
    "\u2018Is thine own heart to shine own face affected?",
    "Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?",
    "Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,",
    "Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.",
    "Narcissus so himself himself forsook,",
    "And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.",
    "\u2018Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,",
    "Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,",
    "Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;",
    "Things growing to themselves are growth\u2019s abuse:",
    "Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;",
    "Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.",
    "\u2018Upon the earth\u2019s increase why shouldst thou feed,",
    "Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?",
    "By law of nature thou art bound to breed,",
    "That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;",
    "And so in spite of death thou dost survive,",
    "In that thy likeness still is left alive.\u2019",
    "By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,",
    "For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,",
    "And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat",
    "With burning eye did hotly overlook them,",
    "Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,",
    "So he were like him and by Venus\u2019 side.",
    "And now Adonis with a lazy spright,",
    "And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,",
    "His louring brows o\u2019erwhelming his fair sight,",
    "Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,",
    "Souring his cheeks, cries, \u2018Fie! no more of love:",
    "The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.\u2019",
    "\u2018Ay me,\u2019 quoth Venus, \u2018young, and so unkind!",
    "What bare excuses mak\u2019st thou to be gone!",
    "I\u2019ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind",
    "Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:",
    "I\u2019ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;",
    "If they burn too, I\u2019ll quench them with my tears.",
    "\u2018The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,",
    "And lo! I lie between that sun and thee:",
    "The heat I have from thence doth little harm,",
    "Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;",
    "And were I not immortal, life were done",
    "Between this heavenly and earthly sun.",
    "\u2018Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?",
    "Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:",
    "Art thou a woman\u2019s son, and canst not feel",
    "What \u2018tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?",
    "O! had thy mother borne so hard a mind,",
    "She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.",
    "\u2018What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?",
    "Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?",
    "What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?",
    "Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:",
    "Give me one kiss, I\u2019ll give it thee again,",
    "And one for interest if thou wilt have twain.",
    "\u2018Fie! lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,",
    "Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,",
    "Statue contenting but the eye alone,",
    "Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:",
    "Thou art no man, though of a man\u2019s complexion,",
    "For men will kiss even by their own direction.\u2019",
    "This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,",
    "And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;",
    "Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;",
    "Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:",
    "And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,",
    "And now her sobs do her intendments break.",
    "Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand;",
    "Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;",
    "Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:",
    "She would, he will not in her arms be bound;",
    "And when from thence he struggles to be gone,",
    "She locks her lily fingers one in one.",
    "\u2018Fondling,\u2019 she saith, \u2018since I have hemm\u2019d thee here",
    "Within the circuit of this ivory pale,",
    "I\u2019ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;",
    "Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:",
    "Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,",
    "Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.",
    "\u2018Within this limit is relief enough,",
    "Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,",
    "Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,",
    "To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:",
    "Then be my deer, since I am such a park;",
    "No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.\u2019",
    "At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,",
    "That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:",
    "Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,",
    "He might be buried in a tomb so simple;",
    "Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,",
    "Why, there Love liv\u2019d, and there he could not die.",
    "These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,",
    "Open\u2019d their mouths to swallow Venus\u2019 liking.",
    "Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?",
    "Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?",
    "Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,",
    "To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!",
    "Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?",
    "Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;",
    "The time is spent, her object will away,",
    "And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:",
    "\u2018Pity,\u2019 she cries; \u2018some favour, some remorse!\u2019",
    "Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.",
    "But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,",
    "A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,",
    "Adonis\u2019 tramping courier doth espy,",
    "And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:",
    "The strong-neck\u2019d steed, being tied unto a tree,",
    "Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.",
    "Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,",
    "And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;",
    "The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,",
    "Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven\u2019s thunder;",
    "The iron bit he crusheth \u2018tween his teeth,",
    "Controlling what he was controlled with.",
    "His ears up-prick\u2019d; his braided hanging mane",
    "Upon his compass\u2019d crest now stand on end;",
    "His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,",
    "As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:",
    "His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,",
    "Shows his hot courage and his high desire.",
    "Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,",
    "With gentle majesty and modest pride;",
    "Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,",
    "As who should say, \u2018Lo! thus my strength is tried;",
    "And this I do to captivate the eye",
    "Of the fair breeder that is standing by.\u2019",
    "What recketh he his rider\u2019s angry stir,",
    "His flattering \u2018Holla\u2019, or his \u2018Stand, I say\u2019?",
    "What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?",
    "For rich caparisons or trapping gay?",
    "He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,",
    "Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.",
    "Look, when a painter would surpass the life,",
    "In limning out a well-proportion\u2019d steed,",
    "His art with nature\u2019s workmanship at strife,",
    "As if the dead the living should exceed;",
    "So did this horse excel a common one,",
    "In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.",
    "Round-hoof\u2019d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,",
    "Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,",
    "High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,",
    "Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:",
    "Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,",
    "Save a proud rider on so proud a back.",
    "Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;",
    "Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;",
    "To bid the wind a base he now prepares,",
    "And whe\u2019r he run or fly they know not whether;",
    "For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,",
    "Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather\u2019d wings.",
    "He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;",
    "She answers him as if she knew his mind;",
    "Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,",
    "She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,",
    "Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,",
    "Beating his kind embracements with her heels.",
    "Then, like a melancholy malcontent,",
    "He vails his tail, that, like a falling plume,",
    "Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:",
    "He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.",
    "His love, perceiving how he is enrag\u2019d,",
    "Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag\u2019d.",
    "His testy master goeth about to take him;",
    "When lo! the unback\u2019d breeder, full of fear,",
    "Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,",
    "With her the horse, and left Adonis there:",
    "As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,",
    "Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.",
    "All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,",
    "Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:",
    "And now the happy season once more fits,",
    "That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;",
    "For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong",
    "When it is barr\u2019d the aidance of the tongue.",
    "An oven that is stopp\u2019d, or river stay\u2019d,",
    "Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:",
    "So of concealed sorrow may be said;",
    "Free vent of words love\u2019s fire doth assuage;",
    "But when the heart\u2019s attorney once is mute",
    "The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.",
    "He sees her coming, and begins to glow,--",
    "Even as a dying coal revives with wind,--",
    "And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;",
    "Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,",
    "Taking no notice that she is so nigh,",
    "For all askance he holds her in his eye.",
    "O! what a sight it was, wistly to view",
    "How she came stealing to the wayward boy;",
    "To note the fighting conflict of her hue,",
    "How white and red each other did destroy:",
    "But now her cheek was pale, and by and by",
    "It flash\u2019d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.",
    "Now was she just before him as he sat,",
    "And like a lowly lover down she kneels;",
    "With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,",
    "Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:",
    "His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand\u2019s print,",
    "As apt as new-fall\u2019n snow takes any dint.",
    "O! what a war of looks was then between them;",
    "Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;",
    "His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;",
    "Her eyes woo\u2019d still, his eyes disdain\u2019d the wooing:",
    "And all this dumb play had his acts made plain",
    "With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.",
    "Full gently now she takes him by the hand,",
    "A lily prison\u2019d in a gaol of snow,",
    "Or ivory in an alabaster band;",
    "So white a friend engirts so white a foe:",
    "This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,",
    "Show\u2019d like two silver doves that sit a-billing.",
    "Once more the engine of her thoughts began:",
    "\u2018O fairest mover on this mortal round,",
    "Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,",
    "My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;",
    "For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,",
    "Though nothing but my body\u2019s bane would cure thee.\u2019",
    "\u2018Give me my hand,\u2019 saith he, \u2018why dost thou feel it?\u2019",
    "\u2018Give me my heart,\u2019 saith she, \u2018and thou shalt have it;",
    "O! give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,",
    "And being steel\u2019d, soft sighs can never grave it:",
    "Then love\u2019s deep groans I never shall regard,",
    "Because Adonis\u2019 heart hath made mine hard.\u2019",
    "\u2018For shame,\u2019 he cries, \u2018let go, and let me go;",
    "My day\u2019s delight is past, my horse is gone,",
    "And \u2018tis your fault I am bereft him so:",
    "I pray you hence, and leave me here alone:",
    "For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,",
    "Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.\u2019",
    "Thus she replies: \u2018Thy palfrey, as he should,",
    "Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:",
    "Affection is a coal that must be cool\u2019d;",
    "Else, suffer\u2019d, it will set the heart on fire:",
    "The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;",
    "Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.",
    "\u2018How like a Jade he stood, tied to the tree,",
    "Servilely master\u2019d with a leathern rein!",
    "But when he saw his love, his youth\u2019s fair fee,",
    "He held such petty bondage in disdain;",
    "Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,",
    "Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.",
    "\u2018Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,",
    "Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,",
    "But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,",
    "His other agents aim at like delight?",
    "Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold",
    "To touch the fire, the weather being cold?",
    "\u2018Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;",
    "And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,",
    "To take advantage on presented joy",
    "Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.",
    "O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,",
    "And once made perfect, never lost again.",
    "\u2018I know not love,\u2019 quoth he, \u2018nor will not know it,",
    "Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;",
    "\u2018Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;",
    "My love to love is love but to disgrace it;",
    "For I have heard it is a life in death,",
    "That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.",
    "\u2018Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish\u2019d?",
    "Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?",
    "If springing things be any jot diminish\u2019d,",
    "They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;",
    "The colt that\u2019s back\u2019d and burden\u2019d being young",

    "Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,",
    "End without audience, and are never done.",
    "For who hath she to spend the night withal,",
    "But idle sounds resembling parasites;",
    "Like shrill-tongu\u2019d tapsters answering every call,",
    "Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?",
    "She says, \u2018\u2018Tis so:\u2019 they answer all, \u2018\u2018Tis so;\u2019",

    "Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,",
    "Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:",
    "She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,",

    "She tells them \u2018tis a causeless fantasy,",
    "And childish error, that they are afraid;",
    "Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:",
    "And with that word she spied the hunted boar;",

    "He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so.",
    "\u2018\u2018Tis true, \u2018tis true; thus was Adonis slain:",
    "He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,",
    "Who did not whet his teeth at him again,",

    "In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,",
    "For they in thee a thousand errors note;",
    "But \u2018tis my heart that loves what they despise,",
    "Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;",
    "Nor are mine ears with thy tongue\u2019s tune delighted,",
    "Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,",
    "Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited",
    "To any sensual feast with thee alone:",
    "But my five wits nor my five senses can",
    "Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,",
    "Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,",
    "Thy proud heart\u2019s slave and vassal wretch to be.",
    "Only my plague thus far I count my gain,",
    "That she that makes me sin awards me pain."

    "Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea",
    "But sad mortality o\u2019er-sways their power,",
    "How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,",
    "Whose action is no stronger than a flower?",
    "O, how shall summer\u2019s honey breath hold out",
    "Against the wrackful siege of batt\u2019ring days,",
    "When rocks impregnable are not so stout,",
    "Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?",
    "O fearful meditation! where, alack,",
    "Shall time\u2019s best jewel from time\u2019s chest lie hid?",
    "Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?",
    "Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?",
    "O, none, unless this miracle have might,",
    "That in black ink my love may still shine bright."

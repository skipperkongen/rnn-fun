    "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought",
    "I summon up remembrance of things past,",
    "I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,",
    "And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:",
    "Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,",
    "For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,",
    "And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,",
    "And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;",
    "Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,",
    "And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er",
    "The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,",
    "Which I new pay as if not paid before.",
    "But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,",
    "All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end."

    "Uncessant Minutes, whil\u2019st you move you tell",
    "The time that tells our life, which though it run",
    "Never so fast or farr, you\u2019r new begun",
    "Short steps shall overtake; for though life well",
    "May scape his own Account, it shall not yours,",

    "The doom of Fate, whose unrecall\u2019d Decree",
    "You date, bring, execute; making what\u2019s new",
    "Ill and good, old, for as we die in you,",
    "You die in Time, Time in Eternity."

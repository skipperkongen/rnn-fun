    "A Poet am I neither born nor bred,",
    "But to a witty poet married:",
    "Whose brain is fresh and pleasant as the Spring,",
    "Where Fancies grow and where the Muses sing.",
    "There oft I lean my head, and listening, hark,",
    "To catch his words and all his fancies mark:",
    "And from that garden show of beauties take",
    "Whereof a posy I in verse may make.",
    "Thus I, that have no gardens of my own,",
    "There gather flowers that are newly blown."

    "Once, boarding the train to New York City,",
    "The aisle crowded and all seats filled, I glimpsed",
    "An open space\u2014more pushing, stuck in place\u2014",
    "And then saw why: a man, face peeled away,",
    "Sewn back in haste, skin grafts that smeared like wax",
    "Spattered and frozen, one eye flesh-filled, smooth,",
    "One cold eye toward the window. Cramped, shoved hard,",
    "I, too, passed up the seat, the place, and fought on",
    "Through to the next car, and the next, but now",
    "I wonder why the fire that could have killed him",
    "Spared him, burns scarred over; if a life",
    "Is what he calls this space through which he moves,",
    "Dark space we dared not enter, and what fire",
    "Burns in him when he sees us move away."

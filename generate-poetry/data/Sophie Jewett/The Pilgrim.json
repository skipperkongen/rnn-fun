    "Pilgrim feet, pray whither bound?",
    "Pilgrim eyes, pray whither bent?",

    "Every path their footing wore.",
    "Men are wise; they seek no more",
    "Roads that lead to Holy Land.",
    "Proud his look, as who should say:",
    "Pilgrim, thou art fair of face,",
    "Staff and scrip are not for thee;",
    "Gentle pilgrim, of thy grace,",
    "Leave thy quest, and bide with me.",
    "Love shall serve thee, joy shall bless;",
    "Thou wert made for tenderness:",
    "God's green world is fair and sweet;",
    "Not o'er sea and Eastern strand,",

    "Take thy staff, and have thy will;",
    "Prayer and love shall follow thee;",
    "I will watch thee o'er the hill.",
    "What thy fortune God doth know;",
    "By what paths thy feet must go.",
    "Far and dim the distance lies,",
    "Yet my spirit prophesies:",
    "Not in vigil lone and late,",
    "Bowed upon the tropic sand,",
    "But within the city gate,",
    "In the struggle of the street,",
    "Suddenly thine eyes shall meet",
    "His whose look is Holy Land.",

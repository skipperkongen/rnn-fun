    "\u201cO Love, thou art winged and swift,",
    "Yet stay with me evermore!\u201d",
    "And I guarded my house with bolt and bar",
    "Lest Love fly forth at the door.",
    "Without, in the world, \u2019t was cold,",
    "While Love and I together",
    "Laughed and sang by my red hearth-fire,",
    "Nor knew it was winter weather.",
    "Sweet Love would lull me to sleep,",
    "In his tireless arm caressed;",
    "His shadowing wings and burning eyes",
    "Like night and stars wrought rest.",
    "And ever the beat of Love\u2019s heart",
    "As a chime rang at my ear;",
    "And ever Love\u2019s bending, beautiful face",
    "Covered me close from fear.",
    "Was it long ere I waked alone?",
    "A snow-drift whitened the floor;",
    "I saw spent ashes upon my hearth",
    "And Death in my open door."

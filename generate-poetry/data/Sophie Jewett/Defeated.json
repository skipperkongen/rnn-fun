    "When the last fight is lost, the last sword broken;",
    "The last call sounded, the last order spoken;",
    "When from the field where braver hearts lie sleeping,",
    "Faint, and athirst, and blinded, I come creeping,",
    "With not one waving shred of palm to bring you,",
    "With not one splendid battle-song to sing you,",
    "O Love, in my dishonor and defeat,",
    "Your measureless compassion will be sweet."

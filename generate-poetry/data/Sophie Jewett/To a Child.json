    "The leaves talked in the twilight, dear;",
    "Hearken the tale they told:",
    "How in some far-off place and year,",
    "Before the world grew old,",
    "I was a dreaming forest tree,",
    "You were a wild, sweet bird",
    "Who sheltered at the heart of me",
    "Because the north wind stirred;",
    "How, when the chiding gale was still,",
    "When peace fell soft on fear,",
    "You stayed one golden hour to fill",
    "My dream with singing, dear.",
    "To-night the self-same songs are sung",
    "The first green forest heard;",
    "My heart and the gray world grow young\u2014",
    "To shelter you, my bird."

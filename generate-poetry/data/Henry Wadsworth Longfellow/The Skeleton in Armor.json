    "\u201cSpeak! speak! thou fearful guest!",
    "Who, with thy hollow breast",
    "Still in rude armor drest,",
    "Comest to daunt me!",
    "Wrapt not in Eastern balms,",
    "But with thy fleshless palms",
    "Stretched, as if asking alms,",
    "Why dost thou haunt me?\u201d",
    "Then, from those cavernous eyes",
    "Pale flashes seemed to rise,",
    "As when the Northern skies",
    "Gleam in December;",
    "And, like the water\u2019s flow",
    "Under December\u2019s snow,",
    "Came a dull voice of woe",
    "From the heart\u2019s chamber.",
    "\u201cI was a Viking old!",
    "My deeds, though manifold,",
    "No Skald in song has told,",
    "No Saga taught thee!",
    "Take heed, that in thy verse",
    "Thou dost the tale rehearse,",
    "Else dread a dead man\u2019s curse;",
    "For this I sought thee.",
    "\u201cFar in the Northern Land,",
    "By the wild Baltic\u2019s strand,",
    "I, with my childish hand,",
    "Tamed the gerfalcon;",
    "And, with my skates fast-bound,",
    "Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,",
    "That the poor whimpering hound",
    "Trembled to walk on.",
    "\u201cOft to his frozen lair",
    "Tracked I the grisly bear,",
    "While from my path the hare",
    "Fled like a shadow;",
    "Oft through the forest dark",
    "Followed the were-wolf\u2019s bark,",
    "Until the soaring lark",
    "Sang from the meadow.",
    "\u201cBut when I older grew,",
    "Joining a corsair\u2019s crew,",
    "O\u2019er the dark sea I flew",
    "With the marauders.",
    "Wild was the life we led;",
    "Many the souls that sped,",
    "Many the hearts that bled,",
    "By our stern orders.",
    "\u201cMany a wassail-bout",
    "Wore the long Winter out;",
    "Often our midnight shout",
    "Set the cocks crowing,",
    "As we the Berserk\u2019s tale",
    "Measured in cups of ale,",
    "Draining the oaken pail,",
    "Filled to o\u2019erflowing.",
    "\u201cOnce as I told in glee",
    "Tales of the stormy sea,",
    "Soft eyes did gaze on me,",
    "Burning yet tender;",
    "And as the white stars shine",
    "On the dark Norway pine,",
    "On that dark heart of mine",
    "Fell their soft splendor.",
    "\u201cI wooed the blue-eyed maid,",
    "Yielding, yet half afraid,",
    "And in the forest\u2019s shade",
    "Our vows were plighted.",
    "Under its loosened vest",
    "Fluttered her little breast,",
    "Like birds within their nest",
    "By the hawk frighted.",
    "\u201cBright in her father\u2019s hall",
    "Shields gleamed upon the wall,",
    "Loud sang the minstrels all,",
    "Chanting his glory;",
    "When of old Hildebrand",
    "I asked his daughter\u2019s hand,",
    "Mute did the minstrels stand",
    "To hear my story.",
    "\u201cWhile the brown ale he quaffed,",
    "Loud then the champion laughed,",
    "And as the wind-gusts waft",
    "The sea-foam brightly,",
    "So the loud laugh of scorn,",
    "Out of those lips unshorn,",
    "From the deep drinking-horn",
    "Blew the foam lightly.",
    "\u201cShe was a Prince\u2019s child,",
    "I but a Viking wild,",
    "And though she blushed and smiled,",
    "I was discarded!",
    "Should not the dove so white",
    "Follow the sea-mew\u2019s flight,",
    "Why did they leave that night",
    "Her nest unguarded?",
    "\u201cScarce had I put to sea,",
    "Bearing the maid with me,",
    "Fairest of all was she",
    "Among the Norsemen!",
    "When on the white sea-strand,",
    "Waving his armed hand,",
    "Saw we old Hildebrand,",
    "With twenty horsemen.",
    "\u201cThen launched they to the blast,",
    "Bent like a reed each mast,",
    "Yet we were gaining fast,",
    "When the wind failed us;",
    "And with a sudden flaw",
    "Came round the gusty Skaw,",
    "So that our foe we saw",
    "Laugh as he hailed us.",
    "\u201cAnd as to catch the gale",
    "Round veered the flapping sail,",
    "\u2018Death!\u2019 was the helmsman\u2019s hail,",
    "\u2018Death without quarter!\u2019",
    "Mid-ships with iron keel",
    "Struck we her ribs of steel;",
    "Down her black hulk did reel",
    "Through the black water!",
    "\u201cAs with his wings aslant,",
    "Sails the fierce cormorant,",
    "Seeking some rocky haunt,",
    "With his prey laden, \u2014",
    "So toward the open main,",
    "Beating to sea again,",
    "Through the wild hurricane,",
    "Bore I the maiden.",
    "\u201cThree weeks we westward bore,",
    "And when the storm was o\u2019er,",
    "Cloud-like we saw the shore",
    "Stretching to leeward;",
    "There for my lady\u2019s bower",
    "Built I the lofty tower,",
    "Which, to this very hour,",
    "Stands looking seaward.",
    "\u201cThere lived we many years;",
    "Time dried the maiden\u2019s tears;",
    "She had forgot her fears,",
    "She was a mother;",
    "Death closed her mild blue eyes,",
    "Under that tower she lies;",
    "Ne\u2019er shall the sun arise",
    "On such another!",
    "\u201cStill grew my bosom then,",
    "Still as a stagnant fen!",
    "Hateful to me were men,",
    "The sunlight hateful!",
    "In the vast forest here,",
    "Clad in my warlike gear,",
    "Fell I upon my spear,",
    "Oh, death was grateful!",
    "\u201cThus, seamed with many scars,",
    "Bursting these prison bars,",
    "Up to its native stars",
    "My soul ascended!",
    "There from the flowing bowl",
    "Deep drinks the warrior\u2019s soul,",
    "Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!\u201d",
    "Thus the tale ended."

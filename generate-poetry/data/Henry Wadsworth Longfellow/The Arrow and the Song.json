    "I shot an arrow into the air,",
    "It fell to earth, I knew not where;",
    "For, so swiftly it flew, the sight",
    "Could not follow it in its flight.",
    "I breathed a song into the air,",
    "It fell to earth, I knew not where;",
    "For who has sight so keen and strong,",
    "That it can follow the flight of song?",
    "Long, long afterward, in an oak",
    "I found the arrow, still unbroke;",
    "And the song, from beginning to end,",
    "I found again in the heart of a friend."

    "I strolled upon the Brooklyn Bridge one day,",
    "Beneath the storm;",
    "None but a lad in rags upon the way",
    "I saw;\u2014there on a bench he lay",
    "Heedless of form.",
    "He seemingly was reading what the Shower",
    "Was publishing upon the Bridge and down the Bay;",
    "Yet he was writing, writing at this hour,\u2014",
    "Writing in a careless sort of way.",
    "Upon a pad he scribbled and as fast the rain",
    "Retouched, effaced, corrected and revised.",
    "Was he recording Nature\u2019s solemn strain,",
    "Or sketching choristers therein disguised?",
    "Whatever it be, I found myself quite by his side:",
    "My nod and smile he pocketed and wrote again;",
    "\u201cRead me your drizzling stuff,\u201d I said, and he replied:",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve written a check in payment for this shower of rain.\u201d"

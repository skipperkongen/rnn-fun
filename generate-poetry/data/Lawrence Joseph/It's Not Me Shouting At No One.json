    "Before dawn, on the street again,",
    "beneath sky that washes me",
    "with ice, smoke, metal.",
    "I don't want to think",
    "the bullet pierced my shoulder,",
    "the junkie's rotten teeth",
    "laughed, his yellow hair froze.",
    "I'm careful: 1 smoke",
    "Turkish tobacco cigarette butts,",
    "1 drink a lot to piss a lot,",
    "I fry the pig in its own fat,",
    "eat the knuckles, brain, and stomach;",
    "I don't eat the eyes!",
    "Always four smokestacks",
    "burning bones, somewhere",
    "tears that won't stop,",
    "everywhere blood becomes",
    "flesh that wants to say something.",
    "It's not me shouting at no one",
    "in Cadillac Square: it's God",
    "roaring inside me, afraid",
    "to be alone."

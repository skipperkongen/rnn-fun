    "When Isaac, a small, freckled boy",
    "approaching seven, visits us for Family Camp,",
    "playing pirate with his rubber sword,",
    "sometimes he slumps in grief,",
    "trudging along, his sacrifice and small violin",
    "in hand, his palm over his chest,",
    "saying,",
    ". Before he leaves for home,",
    "we ask if he\u2019d like a Jewish blessing.",
    "Our grandson\u2019s handsome face ignites;",
    "he chirps a rousing,",
    ".",
    "We unfold the prayer shawl,",
    "its Hebrew letters silvering the spring light,",
    "hold the white tallis above his head,",
    "recite the blessing in its ancient language",
    "and then the English, adding,",
    ".",
    "Isaac complains, the tallis didn\u2019t",
    "touch his head, so he didn\u2019t feel the blessing.",
    "We lower its silken ceiling",
    "to graze his dark hair,",
    "repeat the prayer."

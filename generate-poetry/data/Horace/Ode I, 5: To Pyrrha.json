    "What slender youth, bedew\u2019d with liquid odors,",
    "Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave,",
    "Pyrrha? For whom bind\u2019st thou",
    "In wreaths thy golden hair,",
    "Plain in thy neatness? O how oft shall he",
    "Of faith and changed gods complain, and seas",
    "Rough with black winds, and storms",
    "Unwonted shall admire!",
    "Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold,",
    "Who, always vacant, always amiable",
    "Hopes thee, of flattering gales",
    "Unmindful. Hapless they",
    "To whom thou untried seem\u2019st fair. Me, in my vow\u2019d",
    "Picture, the sacred wall declares to have hung",
    "My dank and dropping weeds",
    "To the stern god of sea."

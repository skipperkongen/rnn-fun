    "Leucon, no one\u2019s allowed to know his fate,",
    "Not you, not me: don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t hunt for answers",
    "In tea leaves or palms. Be patient with whatever comes.",
    "This could be our last winter, it could be many",
    "More, pounding the Tuscan Sea on these rocks:",
    "Do what you must, be wise, cut your vines",
    "And forget about hope. Time goes running, even",
    "As we talk. Take the present, the future\u2019s no one\u2019s affair."

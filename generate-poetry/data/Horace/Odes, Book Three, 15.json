    "A Tower of Brass, one would have said,",
    "And Locks, and Bolts, and Iron Bars,",

    "The jealous Father thought he well might spare",
    "All further jealous Care.",
    "And, as he walk\u2019d, t\u2019himself alone he smiled,",
    "To think how Venus\u2019 Arts he had beguil\u2019d;",
    "And when he slept, his Rest was deep:",
    "But Venus laugh\u2019d, to see and hear him sleep:",
    "She taught the am\u2019rous Jove",
    "A magical Receipt in Love,",
    "Which arm\u2019d him stronger, and which help\u2019d him more,",
    "Than all his Thunder did, and his Almightyship before.",

    "His Godhead into Gold he did convert;",
    "No Guards did then his Passage stay,",
    "He pass\u2019d with Ease, Gold was the Word;",
    "Subtle as Light\u2019ning, bright, and quick, and fierce,",
    "Gold thro\u2019 Doors and Walls did pierce;",
    "And as that works sometimes upon the Sword,",
    "Melted the Maidenhead away,",
    "Ev\u2019n in the secret Scabbard where it lay.",
    "The prudent Macedonian King,",
    "To blow up Towns a Golden Mine did spring;",
    "He broke thro\u2019 Gates with this Petarr,",
    "\u2019Tis the great Art of Peace, the Engine \u2019tis of War;",
    "And Fleets and Armies follow it afar;",
    "The Ensign \u2019tis at Land: and \u2019tis the Seaman\u2019s Star."

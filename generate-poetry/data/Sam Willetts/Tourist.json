    "Warsaw, October: rose-madder by four,",
    "the soldierly grey boulevards slippery",
    "with tickets to winter. After forty years rebuilding,",
    "the Old Town is like this beautiful girl I knew",
    "whose face was wheel-broken in a crash,",
    "and remade so well it was hard to say how",
    "she looked wrong. I\u2019d brought two questions here\u2014",
    "holding them as if they might slip:",
    "In an attic-archive\u2014deep card indexes, ink turned lilac",
    "with age\u2014I handed my questions to a love-laborer",
    "in a yarmulke; with sad palms and a shake",
    "of the head he regretted that any answers now",
    "lay probably beyond our reach. So",
    "I abandoned questing and went back to tourism;",
    "joined the passeggiata, drank black tea, got stickied",
    "under sooty lime trees, saw boisterous children,",
    "all knees and elbows, skyline-capering",
    "on the wall at the river-divide. Beyond",
    "their frail silhouettes against the petrol dusk",
    "huge cranes were moving, courtly, confident,",
    "building another new Warsaw across the Vistula."

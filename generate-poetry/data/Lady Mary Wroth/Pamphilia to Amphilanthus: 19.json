    "Come darkest night, becoming sorrow best;",
    "Light; leave thy light; fitt for a lightsome soule;",
    "Darknes doth truly sure with mee oprest",
    "Whom absence power doth from mirthe controle:",
    "The very trees with hanging heads condole",
    "Sweet sommers parting, and of leaves distrest",
    "In dying coulers make a griefe-full role;",
    "Soe much (alas) to sorrow are they prest,",
    "Thus of dead leaves her farewell carpett\u2019s made:",
    "Theyr fall, theyr branches, all theyr mournings prove;",
    "With leavles, naked bodies, whose huese vade",
    "From hopefull greene, to wither in theyr love,",
    "If trees, and leaves for absence, mourners bee",
    "Noe mervaile that I grieve, who like want see."

    "Sweet shades why doe you seeke to give delight",
    "To mee who deeme delight in this vilde place",
    "Butt torment, sorrow, and mine owne disgrace",
    "To taste of joy, or your vaine pleasing sight;",
    "Show them your pleasures who saw never night",
    "Of greife, wher joyings fauning, smiling face",
    "Appeers as day, wher griefe found never space",
    "Yett for a sigh, a grone, or envies spite;",
    "Butt O on mee a world of woes doe ly,",
    "Or els on mee all harmes strive to rely,",
    "And to attend like servants bound to mee,",
    "Heat in desire, while frosts of care I prove,",
    "Wanting my love, yett surfett doe with love",
    "Burne, and yett freeze, better in hell to bee."

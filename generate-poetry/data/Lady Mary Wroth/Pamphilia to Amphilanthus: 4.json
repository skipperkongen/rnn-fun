    "When I beeheld the Image of my deere",
    "With greedy lookes mine eyes would that way bend,",
    "Fear, and desire did inwardly contend;",
    "Feare to bee mark\u2019d, desire to drawe still neere,",
    "And in my soule a speritt wowld apeer,",
    "Which boldnes waranted, and did pretend",
    "To bee my genius, yett I durst nott lend",
    "My eyes in trust wher others seemed soe cleere,",
    "Then did I search from whence this danger \u2019rose,",
    "If such unworthynes in mee did rest",
    "As my sterv\u2019d eyes must nott with sight bee blest;",
    "When jealousie her poyson did disclose;",
    "Yett in my hart unseense of jealous eye",
    "The truer Image shall in triumph lye."

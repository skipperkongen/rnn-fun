    "Suppose, my little lady,",
    "Your doll should break her head,",
    "Could you make it whole by crying",
    "Till your eyes and nose are red?",
    "And would n\u2019t it be pleasanter",
    "To treat it as a joke;",
    "And say you \u2019re glad \u201c\u2019T was Dolly\u2019s",
    "And not your head that broke?\u201d",
    "Suppose you \u2019re dressed for walking,",
    "And the rain comes pouring down,",
    "Will it clear off any sooner",
    "Because you scold and frown?",
    "And would n\u2019t it be nicer",
    "For you to smile than pout,",
    "And so make sunshine in the house",
    "When there is none without?",
    "Suppose your task, my little man,",
    "Is very hard to get,",
    "Will it make it any easier",
    "For you to sit and fret?",
    "And would n\u2019t it be wiser",
    "Than waiting like a dunce,",
    "To go to work in earnest",
    "And learn the thing at once?",
    "Suppose that some boys have a horse,",
    "And some a coach and pair,",
    "Will it tire you less while walking",
    "To say, \u201cIt is n\u2019t fair?\u201d",
    "And would n\u2019t it be nobler",
    "To keep your temper sweet,",
    "And in your heart be thankful",
    "You can walk upon your feet?",
    "And suppose the world don\u2019t please you,",
    "Nor the way some people do,",
    "Do you think the whole creation",
    "Will be altered just for you?",
    "And is n\u2019t it, my boy or girl,",
    "The wisest, bravest plan,",
    "Whatever comes, or does n\u2019t come,",
    "To do the best you can?"

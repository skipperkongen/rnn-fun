    "The red and white works now no more on me",
    "Than if it could not charm, or I not see.",
    "And yet the face continues good,",
    "And I have still desires,",
    "Am still the selfsame flesh and blood,",
    "As apt to melt",
    "And suffer from those fires;",
    "Oh some kind pow\u2019r unriddle where it lies,",
    "Whether my heart be faulty, or her eyes?",
    "She ev\u2019ry day her man does kill,",
    "And I as often die;",
    "Neither her power then, nor my will",
    "Can question\u2019d be.",
    "What is the mystery?",
    "Sure beauty\u2019s empires, like to greater states,",
    "Have certain periods set, and hidden fates."

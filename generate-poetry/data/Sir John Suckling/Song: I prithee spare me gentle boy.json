    "I prithee spare me gentle boy,",
    "Press me no more for that slight toy,",
    "That foolish trifle of an heart;",
    "I swear it will not do its part,",
    "Though thou dost thine, employ\u2019st thy pow\u2019r and art.",
    "For through long custom it has known",
    "The little secrets, and is grown",
    "Sullen and wise, will have its will,",
    "And like old hawks pursues that still",
    "That makes least sport, flies only where\u2019t can kill.",
    "Some youth that has not made his story,",
    "Will think perchance the pain\u2019s the glory,",
    "And mannerly sit out love\u2019s feast;",
    "I shall be carving of the best,",
    "Rudely call for the last course \u2019fore the rest.",
    "And oh when once that course is past,",
    "How short a time the feast doth last;",
    "Men rise away and scarce say grace,",
    "Or civilly once thank the face",
    "That did invite, but seek another place."

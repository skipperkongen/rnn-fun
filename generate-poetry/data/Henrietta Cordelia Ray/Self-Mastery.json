    "To catch the spirit in its wayward flight",
    "Through mazes manifold, what task supreme!",
    "For when to floods has grown the quiet stream,",
    "Much human skill must aid its rage to fight;",
    "And when wild winds invade the solemn night,",
    "Seems not man\u2019s vaunted power but a dream?",
    "And still more futile, ay, we e\u2019en must deem",
    "This quest to tame the soul, and guide aright",
    "Its restless wanderings, \u2013 to lure it back",
    "To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh",
    "Attend the strife; till, effort merged in prayer,",
    "Oft uttered, clung to \u2013 when of strength the lack",
    "Seems direst \u2013 brings the answer to our cry:",
    "A gift from Him who lifts our ev\u2019ry care."

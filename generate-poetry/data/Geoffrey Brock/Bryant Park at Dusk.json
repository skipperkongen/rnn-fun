    "Floodlights have flared on behind and above",
    "Where I sit in my public chair.",
    "The lawn that had gradually darkened has brightened.",
    "The library windows stare.",
    "I\u2019m alone in a crowd\u2014",
    ".",
    "Far from a family I miss.",
    "I\u2019d almost say I\u2019m lonely, but lonely",
    "Is worse, I recall, than this.",
    "Loneliness is a genuine poverty.",
    "I\u2019m like a man who is flush",
    "But forgot his wallet on the nightstand",
    "When he left for work in a rush,",
    "And now must go without food and coffee",
    "For a few hours more than he\u2019d wish.",
    "That\u2019s all. He still",
    "a wallet. It\u2019s bulging.",
    "It floats through his brain like a fish...",
    "Money for love: a terrible simile,",
    "But maybe it\u2019s fitting here,",
    "A couple of blocks from Madison Avenue",
    "Where commodities are",
    "Where all around me, rich skyscrapers",
    "Woo the impoverished sky,",
    "Having sent on their way the spent commuters",
    "Who stream, uncertain, by\u2014",
    "And as for this whole splurge of a city,",
    "Isn\u2019t money at its heart?",
    "But I\u2019m blathering now. Forgetting my subject.",
    "What I meant to say at the start",
    "Is that I noticed a woman reading",
    "In a chair not far from mine.",
    "Silver-haired, calm, she stirred a hunger",
    "Hard for me to define,",
    "Perhaps because she",
    "seem lonely.",
    "And what I loved was this:",
    "The way, when dusk had darkened her pages,",
    "As if expecting a kiss,",
    "She closed her eyes and threw her head back,",
    "Book open on her lap.",
    "Perhaps she was thinking about her story,",
    "Or the fall air, or a nap.",
    "I thought she\u2019d leave me then for pastimes",
    "More suited to the dark.",
    "But she is on intimate terms, it seems,",
    "With the rhythms of Bryant Park,",
    "For that\u2019s when the floodlights came on, slowly,",
    "Somewhere far above my need,",
    "And the grass grew green again, and the woman",
    "Reopened her eyes to read."

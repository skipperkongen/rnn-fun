    "Often the slightest gesture is most telling,",
    "As when he reaches tenderly in passing",
    "To pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall",
    "Of her hair, or even the absence of all gesture:",
    "The way she doesn\u2019t need to turn to know",
    "Who, in this gathering of friends, has touched her.",
    "It was as if he dreamed some private garden.",
    "Perhaps he woke from it, mid-reach, to find",
    "His hand too near her hair in this crowded yard,",
    "And maybe even now she\u2019s shuttering in",
    "(She\u2019s even better than you or I at that)",
    "A storm of worry and recrimination\u2014",
    "By seamlessly continuing to tell you",
    "About her trip to see her favorite Vermeer",
    "This morning in the Delft show at the Met:",
    "\u201cSo now they say she isn\u2019t weighing pearls",
    "Or gold or anything\u2014it\u2019s just the light",
    "Gleaming off empty scales.\u201d So much is hard",
    "To know for sure. If I confronted her,",
    "She\u2019d say it was just a leaf\u2014who could afford",
    "To disagree? Could we? Now she\u2019s explaining",
    "How the girl faces a mirror we can\u2019t see into",
    "And how behind her hangs a gloomy painting",
    "Of the Last Judgment: \u201cOver her head God",
    "Floats in a cloud,\u201d she says, \u201clike a thought balloon.\u201d",
    "But you don\u2019t hear. You\u2019re watching me. I nod."

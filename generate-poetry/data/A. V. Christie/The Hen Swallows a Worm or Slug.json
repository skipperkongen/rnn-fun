    "through leaf mould, worm casings she kicks off",
    "in a fan behind her. I use a stick",
    "to dig, to find for her what she\u2019s shown me",
    "near the roots, at the edge of a step\u2014sticky",
    "slug on the underside of a hosta\u2019s leaf.",
    "How complicated she is and how resigned.",
    "Between her beak and my outstretched hand,",
    "the worm\u2019s writhing. Then the long slick going",
    "down. It fills the throat, like all that\u2019s swallowed.",
    "Her head chucks it back,",
    "for the worm again dark.",
    "The hen\u2019s pupil dilates.",
    "She wends and follows.",
    "Her queries, sighs, low gurgles, the hastening",
    "click of her nails on pavement then hungry",
    "again into the grass. Grubs are larger",
    "than pale yellow larvae I prize from inside",
    "chestnuts. These mucousy blind wanderers",
    "she eats right from my palm. Nevertheless I am",
    "repulsed by my husband\u2019s embrace. I turn",
    "now from his thick belly, breasts, his interests.",
    "A body I had clambered over, loved.",
    "I scrabble, struggle. I cover myself.",
    "Another sticky truth dug up",
    "that I must re-bury\u2014",
    "sorry on hands and knees,",
    "hungry and wary."

    "Womanhood, wanton, ye want:",
    "Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;",
    "Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,",
    "Ye rail at riot, reckless:",
    "To praise your port it is needless;",
    "For all your draff yet and your dregs,",
    "As well borne as ye full oft time begs.",
    "Why so coy and full of scorn?",
    "Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;",
    "My new furr\u00e8d gown, when it is worn\u2026",
    "Put up your purse, ye shall not pay!",
    "By crede, I trust to see the day,",
    "As proud a pea-hen as ye spread,",
    "Of me and other ye may have need!",
    "Though angelic be your smiling,",
    "Yet is your tongue an adder\u2019s tail,",
    "Full like a scorpion stinging",
    "All those by whom ye have avail.",
    "Good mistress Anne, there ye do shail:",
    "What prate ye, pretty pigesnye?",
    "I trust to \u2019quite you ere I die!",
    "Your key is meet for every lock,",
    "Your key is common and hangeth out;",
    "Your key is ready, we need not knock,",
    "Nor stand long wresting there about;",
    "Of your door-gate ye have no doubt:",
    "But one thing is, that ye be lewd:",
    "Hold your tongue now, all beshrewd!",
    "To mistress Anne, that farly sweet,",
    "That wones at The Key in Thames Street."

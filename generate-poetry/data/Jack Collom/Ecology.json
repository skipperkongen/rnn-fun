    "Surrounded by bone, surrounded by cells,",
    "by rings, by rings of hell, by hair, surrounded by",
    "air-is-a-thing, surrounded by silhouette, by honey-wet bees, yet",
    "by skeletons of trees, surrounded by actual, yes, for practical",
    "purposes, people, surrounded by surreal",
    "popcorn, surrounded by the reborn: Surrender in the center",
    "to surroundings. O surrender forever, never",
    "end her, let her blend around, surrender to the surroundings that",
    "surround the tender endo-surrender, that",
    "tumble through the tumbling to that blue that",
    "curls around the crumbling, to that, the blue that",
    "rumbles under the sun bounding the pearl that",
    "we walk on, talk on; we can chalk that",
    "up to experience, sensing the brown here that\u2019s",
    "blue now, a drop of water surrounding a cow that\u2019s",
    "black & white, the warbling Blackburnian twitter that\u2019s",
    "machining midnight orange in the light that\u2019s",
    "glittering in the light green visible wind. That\u2019s",
    "the ticket to the tunnel through the thicket that\u2019s",
    "a cricket\u2019s funnel of music to correct & pick it out",
    "from under the wing that whirls up over & out."

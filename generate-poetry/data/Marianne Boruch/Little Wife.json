    "They redid King Tut splendid,",
    "once stone-huge as this",
    "yet his wife\u2019s feet",
    "tiny, the only thing of her now",
    "low, next to him. A few toes, some of the rest,",
    "a bit of ankle, that\u2019s it",
    "in the shade of her husband\u2019s looming, massive",
    "looking straight ahead into the future",
    "where we live and can\u2019t",
    "eye-to-eye, where to stare at him",
    "is to suffer",
    ", head back and up",
    "\u00e0 la the high just-leafing-out trees as bright bits",
    "wing their blink",
    "and hide. Little wife,",
    "such small feet, the thought",
    "dwarfs the king",
    "as ache, as what is",
    "ever left of us",
    "and oh, I like her better."

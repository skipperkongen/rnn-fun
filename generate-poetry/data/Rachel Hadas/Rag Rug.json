    "It has arrived\u2014the long rag rug",
    "multiply folded. On top, one alien hair.",
    "I put my face to the folds and smell despair",
    "palpable as salt air",
    "in all those rooms and houses, small and smug\u2014",
    "enclosures I passed through on my way where?",
    "Whoever did the weaving appears old",
    "in my mind\u2019s eye. I can\u2019t make out her face,",
    "can only conjure up the faintest trace",
    "of an abstracted grace,",
    "clack of the loom. Does she know they\u2019ll be sold",
    "these precious things, in some unheard-of place?",
    "I perch her on a hill, precariously",
    "beyond the reach of waves\u2019 daily boom.",
    "Sun blazes overhead, but her dim room",
    "(no bigger than the loom)",
    "is proof against the violence of the sky",
    "From it I further spin what I once called my home:",
    "Endless horizons fading into haze,",
    "the mornings dawn came up so rosy clear;",
    "snails in the garden, sheep bells everywhere,",
    "the brightness of the air,",
    "terraces, valleys organizing space",
    "and time\u2019s cessation. So this package here",
    "I\u2019m now unwrapping, in New York, today",
    "(rugs like rainbows, woven with a grace",
    "my strands of language barely can express;",
    "dishrags of dailiness",
    "dispersed and recombined and freshly gay)",
    "comes to me imbued with images,",
    "slowly and faithfully across the water,",
    "across the world. It represents a time",
    "I myself snipped and recombined as rhyme",
    "as soon as I went home,",
    "if that is where I am. These rugs recover",
    "the sense of stepping twice into a single river."

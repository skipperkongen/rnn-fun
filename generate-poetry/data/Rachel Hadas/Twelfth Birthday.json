    "As if because you lay",
    "inside",
    "my body, I could",
    "follow your swift thoughts into their blue",
    "immersion even now,",
    "stilettoes flickering, or schools of fish",
    "maneuvering, first clear and then occluded,",
    "though now and then a piercing gleam cuts through;",
    "as if the snow reflections that glaze",
    "the winter afternoon to porcelain",
    "could penetrate the secrets of a skull",
    "that happens to have lodged",
    "inside me once. Your liberation",
    "twelve years ago today is the occasion",
    "you and your friends are celebrating now",
    "behind a door that\u2019s firmly shut.",
    "The fantasy you\u2019ve lately been devouring",
    "features an evil mage with hourglass eyes.",
    "Last week, when you were furious at me",
    "(I must have thrown some precious thing away),",
    "you swiftly slipped into your parents\u2019 room",
    "and turned the bedside clock an hour ahead.",
    "Discovered as the culprit, wickedly",
    "you smiled. You knew time was my enemy."

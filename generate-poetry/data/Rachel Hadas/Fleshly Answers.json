    "Doomed beauties, my companions, my familiars,",

    "a questions twines in all the undergrowth.",
    "How can we tell the living from the dead?",
    "Puvis de Chavanne\u2019s tall pearly figures",
    "dressed as sturdy Spartans at the chase",
    "turn out to be pale paper dolls in space.",
    "And how can we be sure that we\u2019re alive?",
    "Our bodies, aging, changing, slow and stiffen.",
    "On flesh if not yet quite inert increasingly opaque,",
    "bite or bruise or blemish pose the questions",
    "Where have you been? What have you been doing?",
    "My sister\u2019s leg, scaled by a manic cat",
    "nearly three years ago, still is scored and punctured.",
    "Last September I picked blackberries",
    "bare-armed; here are the scratches ten weeks later.",
    "We are passing through the world.",
    "This is some of what it does to us."

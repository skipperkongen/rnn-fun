    "black and white grid of rage,",
    "steam of sheer fury spewing from the vent",
    "of violence that followed where they went.",
    "Wind howled on the battlements, but sun",
    "gilded glum canals. The lovers floated",
    "beneath black bridges, coupled in stone rooms.",
    "The unrepentant villain (at the start",
    "so all the rest was flashback)",
    "dangled from a cage",
    "squinting inscrutably at the funeral",
    "procession winding through the town below.",
    "The air was full of wailing.",
    "Knives of sunlight glittered on the sea.",
    "We lurched out onto Fifty-Seventh Street.",
    "You said \u201cI think I\u2019m dying.\u201d",
    "Next week your eyes went out.",
    "Shining under the lamp,",
    "your blue gaze, now opaque,",
    "your face drawn sharper but still beautiful:",
    "from this extremity you can attempt",
    "to rise to rage and grief. Or you can yield",
    "to the cozy quicksand of the bed.",
    "You wave your hand at walls of books:",
    "\u201cWhat do I do? Do I throw all these away?\u201d",
    "Their anecdotes, their comforts\u2014now black glass."

    "Then the day passed into the evening,",
    "a sovereign, darkening blue. And",
    "the twenty-six lost miners,",
    "if living at all, knew nothing of the hour:",
    "not the languid canter",
    "of light, or the wind",
    "curled through the hedgerows. Not pain.",
    "Not rage. If living at all then",
    "just this: a worm of black water",
    "at the lower back. At the lungs",
    "two tablets of air.",
    "What is it like there? the broadcaster asked,",
    "his voice and the slow reply",
    "cast down through the time zones of America.",
    "A stillness. All of the families",
    "asleep in the fire station.",
    "And the mineworks pale on the landscape.",
    "What else?",
    "Nothing. Blue lights of police cars.",
    "What else?",
    "Nothing.",
    "Nothing?",
    "...The thrum of the crickets.",
    "A thousand files on a thousand scrapers.",
    "A thousand taut membranes called",
    "amplifying the breed-song. A landscape of cupped wings",
    "amplifying the breed-song. A thousand bodies",
    "summoned to a thousand bodies\u0097and the song itself a body,",
    "so in tune with the dusk's warmth",
    "it slows when a cloud passes over.",
    "Today. Tomorrow. In that May Nova Scotia darkness",
    "when the earth flared and collapsed.",
    "Before that May. After that darkness.",
    "On the larch bud. On the fire station.",
    "On shale and the grind-steps of magma.",
    "On the gold straining in its seam bed.",
    "On the coal straining. On the twenty-six headlamps",
    "swaying through the drift tunnels. On the bud.",
    "On the leaves, on the meadow grass,",
    "on the wickerwork of shrubs:",
    "dark cape of desire."

    "When the cow died by the green sapling,",
    "her limp udder splayed on the grass",
    "like something from the sea, we offered",
    "our words in their low calibrations\u2014",
    "which was our fashion\u2014then severed",
    "her horns with a pug-toothed blade",
    "and pounded them out to an amber",
    "transparency, two sheets that became,",
    "in their moth-wing haze, our parlor windows.",
    "They softened our guests with the gauze-light",
    "of the Scriptures, and rendered to us,",
    "on our merriest days, the sensation",
    "of gazing through the feet of a gander.",
    "In time we moved up to the status",
    "of glass\u2014one pane, then two\u2014each",
    "cupping in proof of its purity",
    "a dimple of fault, a form of distortion",
    "enhancing our image. We took the panes",
    "with us from cottage to cottage,",
    "moth-horn and glass, and wedged up",
    "the misfitted gaps with a poultice",
    "of gunny and wax. When woodsmoke",
    "darkened our bricks, we gave",
    "to the windowsills a lacquer",
    "of color\u2014clear blue with a lattice",
    "of yellow: a primary entrance and exit",
    "for light. And often, walking home",
    "from the river and small cheese shop,",
    "we would squint their colors to a sapling",
    "green, and remember the hull",
    "of that early body, the slap of fear",
    "we suffered there, then the little wash",
    "of recovery that is our fashion\u2014how",
    "we stroked to her bones a cadenced droning,",
    "and took back from her absence, our",
    "amber, half-literal method of sight."

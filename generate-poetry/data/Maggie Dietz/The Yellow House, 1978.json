    "The kitchen in the house had a nook for eating, a groove",
    "for the broom behind the door and the woman moved through",
    "it like bathing, reaching ladles from drawers, turning to lift",
    "the milk from the refrigerator while still stirring the pudding,",
    "as if the room and everything in it were as intimate to her as her",
    "body, as beautiful and worthy of her attention as the elbows",
    "which each day she soothed with rose lotion or the white legs",
    "she lifted, again and again, in turn, while watching television.",
    "To be in that room must be what it was like to be the man",
    "next to her at night, or the child who, at six o\u2019clock had stood",
    "close enough to smell the wool of her sweater through the steam,",
    "and later, at the goodnight kiss, could breathe the flavor of her hair\u2014",
    "codfish and broccoli\u2014and taste the coffee, which was darkness",
    "on her lips, and listen then from upstairs to the water running",
    "down, the mattress drifting down the river, a pale moonmark",
    "on the floor, and hear the clink of silverware\u2014the stars, their distant",
    "speaking\u2014and picture the ceiling\u2014the back of a woman kneeling,",
    "covering the heart and holding up the bed and roof and cooling sky."

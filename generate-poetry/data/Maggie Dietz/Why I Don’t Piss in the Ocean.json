    "Once my sister told me that from her summit at the city",
    "pool she could see the yellow billows spread like gas",
    "or dreams between kids\u2019 legs. In something the size of the sea,",
    "you can\u2019t be sure who\u2019s watching from above. Let\u2019s say",
    "it\u2019s the Almighty, twirling His whistle, ready to blow it",
    "at any moment and let loose the bottomless Apocalypse:",
    "the ocean would make bone of a body, coral of bone.",
    "Piss, and a tiger-fish darts through a skull-hole, a weed",
    "weaves itself through ribs. You, too, have seen",
    "the bulbs flash from the sea. You, too, have felt",
    "it breathing down your neck. You eat fish. You\u2019ve heard",
    "that mermaids sing. My dreams are as beleaguered as the next",
    "Joe\u2019s, my happiness as absurd, but I\u2019m not going to go",
    "piss in the ocean about it. No, not in the ocean."

    "Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,",
    "That beat to battle where he stands;",
    "Thy face across his fancy comes,",
    "And gives the battle to his hands:",
    "A moment, while the trumpets blow,",
    "He sees his brood about thy knee;",
    "The next, like fire he meets the foe,",
    "And strikes him dead for thine and thee."

    "Dark house, by which once more I stand",
    "Here in the long unlovely street,",
    "Doors, where my heart was used to beat",
    "So quickly, waiting for a hand,",
    "A hand that can be clasp'd no more\u2014",
    "Behold me, for I cannot sleep,",
    "And like a guilty thing I creep",
    "At earliest morning to the door.",
    "He is not here; but far away",
    "The noise of life begins again,",
    "And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain",
    "On the bald street breaks the blank day."

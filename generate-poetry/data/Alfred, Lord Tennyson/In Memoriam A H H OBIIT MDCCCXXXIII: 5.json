    "I sometimes hold it half a sin",
    "To put in words the grief I feel;",
    "For words, like Nature, half reveal",
    "And half conceal the Soul within.",
    "But, for the unquiet heart and brain,",
    "A use in measured language lies;",
    "The sad mechanic exercise,",
    "Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.",
    "In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,",
    "Like coarsest clothes against the cold;",
    "But that large grief which these enfold",
    "Is given in outline and no more."

    "It is the miller\u2019s daughter,",
    "And she is grown so dear, so dear,",
    "That I would be the jewel",
    "That trembles at her ear:",
    "For hid in ringlets day and night,",
    "I\u2019d touch her neck so warm and white.",
    "And I would be the girdle",
    "About her dainty, dainty waist,",
    "And her heart would beat against me,",
    "In sorrow and in rest:",
    "And I should know if it beat right,",
    "I\u2019d clasp it round so close and tight.",
    "And I would be the necklace,",
    "And all day long to fall and rise",
    "Upon her balmy bosom,",
    "With her laughter or her sighs:",
    "And I would lie so light, so light,",
    "I scarce should be unclasped at night."

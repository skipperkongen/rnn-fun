    "In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,",

    "It is the little rift within the lute,",
    "That by and by will make the music mute,",
    "And ever widening slowly silence all.",
    "The little rift within the lover\u2019s lute,",
    "Or little pitted speck in garner\u2019d fruit,",
    "That rotting inward slowly moulders all.",
    "It is not worth the keeping: let it go:",
    "But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.",
    "And trust me not at all or all in all."

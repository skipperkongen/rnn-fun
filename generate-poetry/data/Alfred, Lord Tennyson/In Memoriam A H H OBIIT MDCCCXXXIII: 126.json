    "Love is and was my Lord and King,",
    "And in his presence I attend",
    "To hear the tidings of my friend,",
    "Which every hour his couriers bring.",
    "Love is and was my King and Lord,",
    "And will be, tho' as yet I keep",
    "Within his court on earth, and sleep",
    "Encompass'd by his faithful guard,",
    "And hear at times a sentinel",
    "Who moves about from place to place,",
    "And whispers to the worlds of space,",
    "In the deep night, that all is well."

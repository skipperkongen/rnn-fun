    "When first thou on me, Lord, wrought'st thy sweet print,",
    "My heart was made thy tinder box.",
    "My \u2019ffections were thy tinder in\u2019t:",
    "Where fell thy sparks by drops.",
    "Those holy sparks of heavenly fire that came",
    "Did ever catch and often out would flame.",
    "But now my heart is made thy censer trim,",
    "Full of thy golden altar\u2019s fire,",
    "To offer up sweet incense in",
    "Unto thyself entire:",
    "I find my tinder scarce thy sparks can feel",
    "That drop out from thy holy flint and steel.",
    "Hence doubts out bud for fear thy fire in me",
    "\u2019S a mocking",
    ";",
    "Or lest thine altars fire out be,",
    "It\u2019s hid in ashes thus.",
    "Yet when the bellows of thy spirit blow",
    "Away mine ashes, then thy fire doth glow."

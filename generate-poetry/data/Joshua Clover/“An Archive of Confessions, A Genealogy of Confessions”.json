    "Now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark",
    "City under the strict surveillance of quotation marks.",
    "The citizens with their cockades and free will drift off",
    "From the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love.",
    "In the far suburbs crenellated of Cartesian yards and gin",
    "The tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in",
    "Across the bluing evening. It\u2019s the hour things get",
    "To be excellently pointless, like describing the alphabet.",
    "Yikes. It\u2019s fine to be here with you watching the great events",
    "Without taking part, clinking our ice as they advance",
    "Yet remain distant. Like the baker always about to understand",
    "Idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of Napoleon",
    "In a baker\u2019s life, always interrupted by the familiar notes",
    "Of a childish song, \u201cno more sleepy dreaming,\u201d we float",
    "Casually on the surface of the day, staring at the bottom,",
    "Jotting in our daybooks, how beautiful, the armies of autumn."

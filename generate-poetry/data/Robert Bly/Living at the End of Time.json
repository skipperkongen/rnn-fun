    "There is so much sweetness in children\u2019s voices,",
    "And so much discontent at the end of day,",
    "And so much satisfaction when a train goes by.",
    "I don\u2019t know why the rooster keeps crying,",
    "Nor why elephants keep raising their trunks,",
    "Nor why Hawthorne kept hearing trains at night.",
    "A handsome child is a gift from God,",
    "And a friend is a vein in the back of the hand,",
    "And a wound is an inheritance from the wind.",
    "Some say we are living at the end of time,",
    "But I believe a thousand pagan ministers",
    "Will arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind.",
    "There\u2019s nothing we need to do about John. The Baptist",
    "Has been laying his hands on earth for so long",
    "That the well water is sweet for a hundred miles.",
    "It\u2019s all right if we don\u2019t know what the rooster",
    "Is saying in the middle of the night, nor why we feel",
    "So much satisfaction when a train goes by."

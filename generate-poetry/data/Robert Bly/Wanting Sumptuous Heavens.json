    "No one grumbles among the oyster clans,",
    "And lobsters play their bone guitars all summer.",
    "Only we, with our opposable thumbs, want",
    "Heaven to be, and God to come, again.",
    "There is no end to our grumbling; we want",
    "Comfortable earth and sumptuous Heaven.",
    "But the heron standing on one leg in the bog",
    "Drinks his dark rum all day, and is content."

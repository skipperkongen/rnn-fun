    "We drive between lakes just turning green;",
    "Late June. The white turkeys have been moved",
    "A second time to new grass.",
    "How long the seconds are in great pain!",
    "Terror just before death,",
    "Shoulders torn, shot",
    "From helicopters. \u201cI saw the boy",
    "being tortured with a telephone generator,\u201d",
    "The sergeant said.",
    "\u201cI felt sorry for him",
    "And blew his head off with a shotgun.\u201d",
    "These instants become crystals,",
    "Particles",
    "The grass cannot dissolve. Our own gaiety",
    "Will end up",
    "In Asia, and you will look down in your cup",
    "And see",
    "Black Starfighters.",
    "Our own cities were the ones we wanted to bomb!",
    "Therefore we will have to",
    "Go far away",
    "To atone",
    "For the suffering of the stringy-chested",
    "And the short rice-fed ones, quivering",
    "In the helicopter like wild animals,",
    "Shot in the chest, taken back to be questioned."

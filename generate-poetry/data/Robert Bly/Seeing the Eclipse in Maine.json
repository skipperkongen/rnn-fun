    "It started about noon. On top of Mount Batte,",
    "We were all exclaiming. Someone had a cardboard",
    "And a pin, and we all cried out when the sun",
    "Appeared in tiny form on the notebook cover.",
    "It was hard to believe. The high school teacher",
    "We\u2019d met called it a pinhole camera,",
    "People in the Renaissance loved to do that.",
    "And when the moon had passed partly through",
    "We saw on a rock underneath a fir tree,",
    "Dozens of crescents\u2014made the same way\u2014",
    "Thousands! Even our straw hats produced",
    "A few as we moved them over the bare granite.",
    "We shared chocolate, and one man from Maine",
    "Told a joke. Suns were everywhere\u2014at our feet."

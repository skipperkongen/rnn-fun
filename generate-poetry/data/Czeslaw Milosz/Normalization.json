    "This happened long ago, before the onset",

    "voted to exile a girl",
    "So thickset and squat",
    "that no stylish dress could ever suit her,",
    "But let\u2019s not yearn for the days of prenormalization.",
    "Just think of the torments, the anxieties, the sweat,",
    "the wiles needed to entice, in spite of all."

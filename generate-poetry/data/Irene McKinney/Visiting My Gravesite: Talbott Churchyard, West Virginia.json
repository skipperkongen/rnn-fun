    "Maybe because I was married and felt secure and dead",
    "at once, I listened to my father\u2019s urgings about \u201cthe future\u201d",
    "and bought this double plot on the hillside with a view",
    "of the bare white church, the old elms, and the creek below.",
    "I plan now to use both plots, luxuriantly spreading out",
    "in the middle of a big double bed. \u2014But no,",
    "finally, my burial has nothing to do with marriage, this lying here",
    "in these same bones will be as real as anything I can imagine",
    "for who I\u2019ll be then, as real as anything undergone, going back",
    "and forth to \u201cthe world\u201d out there, and here to this one spot",
    "on earth I really know. Once I came in fast and low",
    "in a little plane and when I looked down at the church,",
    "the trees I\u2019ve felt with my hands, the neighbors\u2019 houses",
    "and the family farm, and I saw how tiny what I loved or knew was,",
    "it was like my children going on with their plans and griefs",
    "at a distance and nothing I could do about it. But I wanted",
    "to reach down and pat it, while letting it know",
    "I wouldn\u2019t interfere for the world, the world being",
    "everything this isn\u2019t, this unknown buried in the known."

    "I hate to admit this, brother, but there are times",
    "When I\u2019m eating fried chicken",
    "When I think about nothing else but eating fried chicken,",
    "When I utterly forget about my family, honor and country,",
    "The various blood debts you owe me,",
    "My past humiliations and my future crimes\u2014",
    "Everything, in short, but the crispy skin on my fried chicken.",
    "But I\u2019m not altogether evil, there are also times",
    "When I will refuse to lick or swallow anything",
    "That\u2019s not generally available to mankind.",
    "(Which is, when you think about it, absolutely nothing at all.)",
    "And no doubt that\u2019s why apples can cause riots,",
    "And meat brings humiliation,",
    "And each gasp of air",
    "Will fill one\u2019s lungs with gun powder and smoke."

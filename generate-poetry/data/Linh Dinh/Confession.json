    "Perhaps I\u2019m a cruel artist. I always depict",
    "In great details, lovingly, all the defects",
    "On the faces and bodies of my models.",
    "I use my eyes and brushes to thread",
    "The jagged gaps of their stiff smiles. I pamper",
    "Each pimple, hump, massage each incrustation.",
    "I cajole my models into poses that are awkward,",
    "Dangerous, unhygienic, sometimes mortifying.",
    "I don\u2019t care to paint smooth, poreless skin but collect",
    "All manners of rashes and eruptions. Inspired,",
    "I\u2019ve forced a hundred bodies\u2014impossibly old,",
    "Extremely young\u2014onto appalling heaps,",
    "Democratically naked, viscous with sweat, spit and etc.,",
    "Just so I could render the human condition",
    "Most accurately and movingly."

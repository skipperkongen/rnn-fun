    "When I have heard small talk about great men",
    "I climb to bed; light my two candles; then",
    "Consider what was said; and put aside",
    "What Such-a-one remarked and Someone-else replied.",
    "They have spoken lightly of my deathless friends,",
    "(Lamps for my gloom, hands guiding where I stumble,)",
    "Quoting, for shallow conversational ends,",
    "What Shelley shrilled, what Blake once wildly muttered ....",
    "How can they use such names and be not humble?",
    "I have sat silent; angry at what they uttered.",
    "The dead bequeathed them life; the dead have said",
    "What these can only memorize and mumble."

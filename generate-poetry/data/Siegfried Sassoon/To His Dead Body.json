    "When roaring gloom surged inward and you cried,",
    "Groping for friendly hands, and clutched, and died,",
    "Like racing smoke, swift from your lolling head",
    "Phantoms of thought and memory thinned and fled.",
    "Yet, though my dreams that throng the darkened stair",
    "Can bring me no report of how you fare,",
    "Safe quit of wars, I speed you on your way",
    "Up lonely, glimmering fields to find new day,",
    "Slow-rising, saintless, confident and kind\u2014",
    "Dear, red-faced father God who lit your mind."

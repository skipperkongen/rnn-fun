    "Alone he staggered on until he found",
    "Dawn's ghost that filtered down a shafted stair",
    "To the dazed, muttering creatures underground",
    "Who hear the boom of shells in muffled sound.",
    "At last, with sweat and horror in his hair,",
    "He climbed through darkness to the twilight air,",
    "Unloading hell behind him step by step."

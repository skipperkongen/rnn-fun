    "Everyone suddenly burst out singing;",
    "And I was filled with such delight",
    "As prisoned birds must find in freedom,",
    "Winging wildly across the white",
    "Orchards and dark-green fields; on - on - and out of sight.",
    "Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;",
    "And beauty came like the setting sun:",
    "My heart was shaken with tears; and horror",
    "Drifted away ... O, but Everyone",
    "Was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done."

    "Down at the end of Baxter Street, where Five Points",
    "slum used to be, just north of Tombs, is a pocket park.",
    "On these summer days the green plane trees\u2019 leaves",
    "linger heavy as a noon mist above",
    "the men playing mah jongg\u2014more Chinese",
    "in the air than English. The city\u2019s composed",
    "of village greens; we rely on the Thai",
    "place on the corner: Tom Kha for a cold,",
    "jasmine tea for fever, squid for love, Duck Yum",
    "for loneliness. Outside, the grove of heat,",
    "narrow streets where people wrestle rash and unseen",
    "angels; inside, the coolness of a glen and the wait staff",
    "in their pale blue collars offering ice water.",
    "Whatever you\u2019ve done or undone, there\u2019s a dish for you",
    "to take out or eat in: spice for courage, sweet for chagrin."

    "Perhaps it was just another break-in some years back.",
    "Or the charm that suddenly seduces out of nowhere, long rehearsed",
    "till you\u2019ve realized too late",
    "that half your living life went walking straightway out the door",
    "into the noonday glare of some Sunday godforsaken place\u00ad \u2014",
    "somewhere down in central Florida,",
    "the so-called Widow State you thought was safe\u00ad \u2014",
    "which at the time still remained obscure,",
    "so obscure, in fact,",
    "it was almost dark when you awoke, and so unlike yourself",
    "as in a manic haze rifling through those drawers",
    "for letters, tchotchkes, so much else. So you\u2019d suddenly been had.",
    "There are times when the human frailties let down their guard.",
    "There is a ring of fire Dante so numbered, named",
    "for those who prey upon the old.",
    "The kids all grown up and living somewhere else,",
    "and you\u2019re left alone stumbling down the hall.",
    "It could\u2019ve been a friendly call",
    "at first. A friendly knock. A slight accent adding to the charm.",
    "A friend of a friend of a so-called friend no time to trace.",
    "That noonday glare of sunlight as a halo for that added touch.",
    "Have you forgotten anything? Anything?"

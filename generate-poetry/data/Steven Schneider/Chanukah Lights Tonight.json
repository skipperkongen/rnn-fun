    "Our annual prairie Chanukah party\u2014",
    "latkes, kugel, cherry blintzes.",
    "Friends arrive from nearby towns",
    "and dance the twist to \u201cChanukah Lights Tonight,\u201d",
    "spin like a dreidel to a klezmer hit.",
    "The candles flicker in the window.",
    "Outside, ponderosa pines are tied in red bows.",
    "If you squint,",
    "the neighbors\u2019 Christmas lights",
    "look like the Omaha skyline.",
    "The smell of oil is in the air.",
    "We drift off to childhood",
    "where we spent our gelt",
    "on baseball cards and matinees,",
    "cream sodas and potato knishes.",
    "No delis in our neighborhood,",
    "only the wind howling over the crushed corn stalks.",
    "Inside, we try to sweep the darkness out,",
    "waiting for the Messiah to knock,",
    "wanting to know if he can join the party."

    "Not long ago, or maybe I dreamt it",
    "Or made it up, or have suddenly lost",
    "Track of its train in the hocus pocus",
    "Of the dissolving days; no, if I bend",
    "The turn around the corner, come at it",
    "From all three sides at once, or bounce the ball",
    "Against all manner of bleary-eyed fortune",
    "Tellers\u2014well, you can see for yourselves there\u2019s",
    "Nothing up my sleeves, or notice even",
    "Rocks occasionally break if enough",
    "Pressure is applied. As far as you go",
    "In one direction, all the further you\u2019ll",
    "Have to go on before the way back has",
    "Become totally indivisible."

    "Once there were coyotes, cardinals",
    "in the cedar. You could cure amnesia",
    "with the trees of our back-forty. Once",
    "I drowned in a monsoon of frogs\u2014",
    "Grandma said it was a good thing, a promise",
    "for a good crop. Grandma\u2019s perfect tomatoes.",
    "Squash. She taught us to shuck corn, laughing,",
    "never spoke about her childhood",
    "or the faces in gingerbread tins",
    "stacked in the closet.",
    "She was covered in a quilt, the Creek way.",
    "But I don\u2019t know this kind of burial:",
    "vanishing toads, thinning pecan groves,",
    "peach trees choked by palms.",
    "New neighbors tossing clipped grass",
    "over our fence line, griping to the city",
    "of our overgrown fields.",
    "Grandma fell in love with a truck driver,",
    "grew watermelons by the pond",
    "on our Indian allotment,",
    "took us fishing for dragonflies.",
    "When the bulldozers came",
    "with their documents from the city",
    "and a truckload of pipelines,",
    "her shotgun was already loaded.",
    "Under the bent chestnut, the well",
    "where Cosetta\u2019s husband",
    "hid his whiskey\u2014buried beneath roots",
    "her bundle of beads.",
    "the story of our family. Cosetta\u2019s land",
    "flattened to a parking lot.",
    "Grandma potted a cedar sapling",
    "I could take on the road for luck.",
    "She used the bark for heart lesions",
    "doctors couldn\u2019t explain.",
    "To her they were maps, traces of home,",
    "the Milky Way, where she\u2019s going, she said.",
    "After the funeral",
    "I stowed her jewelry in the ground,",
    "promised to return when the rivers rose.",
    "On the grassy plain behind the house",
    "one buffalo remains.",
    "Along the highway\u2019s gravel pits",
    "sunflowers stand in dense rows.",
    "Telephone poles crook into the layered sky.",
    "A crow\u2019s beak broken by a windmill\u2019s blade.",
    "It is then I understand my grandmother:",
    "they only know to take it.",
    "I understand how to walk among hay bales",
    "looking for turtle shells.",
    "How to sing over the groan of the county road",
    "widening to four lanes.",
    "I understand how to keep from looking up:",
    "small planes trail overhead",
    "as I kneel in the Johnson grass",
    "combing away footprints.",
    "Up here, parallel to the median",
    "with a vista of mesas\u2019 weavings,",
    "the sky a belt of blue and white beadwork,",
    "I see our hundred and sixty acres",
    "stamped on God\u2019s forsaken country,",
    "a roof blown off a shed,",
    "beams bent like matchsticks,",
    "a drove of white cows",
    "making their home",
    "in a derailed train car."

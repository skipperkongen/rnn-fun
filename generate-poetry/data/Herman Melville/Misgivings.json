    "When ocean-clouds over inland hills",
    "Sweep storming in late autumn brown,",
    "And horror the sodden valley fills,",
    "And the spire falls crashing in the town,",
    "I muse upon my country\u2019s ills\u2014",
    "The tempest bursting from the waste of Time",
    "On the world\u2019s fairest hope linked with man\u2019s foulest crime.",
    "Nature\u2019s dark side is heeded now\u2014",
    "(Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)\u2014",
    "A child may read the moody brow",
    "Of yon black mountain lone.",
    "With shouts the torrents down the gorges go,",
    "And storms are formed behind the storm we feel:",
    "The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel."

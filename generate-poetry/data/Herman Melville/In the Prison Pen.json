    "Listless he eyes the palisades",

    "But the blur is on his brain.",
    "Around him swarm the plaining ghosts",
    "Like those on Virgil\u2019s shore\u2014",
    "A wilderness of faces dim,",
    "And pale ones gashed and hoar.",
    "A smiting sun. No shed, no tree;",
    "He totters to his lair\u2014",
    "A den that sick hands dug in earth",
    "Ere famine wasted there,",
    "Or, dropping in his place, he swoons,",
    "Walled in by throngs that press,",
    "Till forth from the throngs they bear him dead\u2014",
    "Dead in his meagerness."

    "The ribs and terrors in the whale,",
    "Arched over me a dismal gloom,",
    "While all God\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by,",
    "And left me deepening down to doom.",
    "I saw the opening maw of hell,",
    "With endless pains and sorrows there;",
    "Which none but they that feel can tell\u2014",
    "Oh, I was plunging to despair.",
    "In black distress, I called my God,",
    "When I could scarce believe him mine,",
    "He bowed his ear to my complaints\u2014",
    "No more the whale did me confine.",
    "With speed he flew to my relief,",
    "As on a radiant dolphin borne;",
    "Awful, yet bright, as lightening shone",
    "The face of my Deliverer God.",
    "My song for ever shall record",
    "That terrible, that joyful hour;",
    "I give the glory to my God,",
    "His all the mercy and the power."

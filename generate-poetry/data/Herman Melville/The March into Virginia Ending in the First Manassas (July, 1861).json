    "A rapture sharp, though transitory,",
    "Yet lasting in belaureled story.",
    "So they gayly go to fight,",
    "Chatting left and laughing right.",

    "As on in lightsome files they fare,",
    "Shall die experienced ere three days be spent\u2014",
    "Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare;",
    "Or shame survive, and, like to adamant,",
    "Thy after shock, Manassas, share."

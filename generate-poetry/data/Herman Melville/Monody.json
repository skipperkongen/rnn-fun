    "To have known him, to have loved him",
    "After loneness long;",
    "And then to be estranged in life,",
    "And neither in the wrong;",
    "And now for death to set his seal\u2014",
    "Ease me, a little ease, my song!",
    "By wintry hills his hermit-mound",
    "The sheeted snow-drifts drape,",
    "And houseless there the snow-bird flits",
    "Beneath the fir-trees\u2019 crape:",
    "Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine",
    "That hid the shyest grape."

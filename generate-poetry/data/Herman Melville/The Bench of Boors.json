    "In bed I muse on Tenier\u2019s boors,",
    "Embrowned and beery losels all:",
    "A wakeful brain",
    "Elaborates pain:",
    "Within low doors the slugs of boors",
    "Laze and yawn and doze again.",
    "In dreams they doze, the drowsy boors,",
    "Their hazy hovel warm and small:",
    "Thought\u2019s ampler bound",
    "But chill is found:",
    "Within low doors the basking boors",
    "Snugly hug the ember-mound.",
    "Sleepless, I see the slumberous boors",
    "Their blurred eyes blink, their eyelids fall:",
    "Thought\u2019s eager sight",
    "Aches\u2014overbright!",
    "Within low doors the boozy boors",
    "Cat-naps take in pipe-bowl light."

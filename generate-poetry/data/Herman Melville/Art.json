    "In placid hours well-pleased we dream",
    "Of many a brave unbodied scheme.",
    "But form to lend, pulsed life create,",
    "What unlike things must meet and mate:",
    "A flame to melt\u2014a wind to freeze;",
    "Sad patience\u2014joyous energies;",
    "Humility\u2014yet pride and scorn;",
    "Instinct and study; love and hate;",
    "Audacity\u2014reverence. These must mate,",
    "And fuse with Jacob\u2019s mystic heart,",
    "To wrestle with the angel\u2014Art."

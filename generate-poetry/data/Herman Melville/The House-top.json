    "No sleep. The sultriness pervades the air",
    "And binds the brain\u2014a dense oppression, such",
    "As tawny tigers feel in matted shades,",
    "Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage.",
    "Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads",
    "Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by.",
    "Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf",
    "Of muffled sound, the atheist roar of riot.",
    "Yonder, where parching Sirius set in drought",
    "Balefully glares red Arson\u2014there\u2014and there.",
    "The town is taken by its rats\u2014ship-rats",
    "And rats of the wharves. All civil charms",
    "And priestly spells which late held hearts in awe\u2014",
    "Fear-bound, subjected to a better sway",
    "Than sway of self; these like a dream dissolve,",
    "And man rebounds whole aeons back in nature.",
    "Hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead,",
    "And ponderous drag that shakes the wall.",
    "Wise Draco comes, deep in the midnight roll",
    "Of black artillery; he comes, though late;",
    "In code corroborating Calvin\u2019s creed",
    "And cynic tyrannies of honest kings;",
    "He comes, nor parlies; and the Town, redeemed,",
    "Gives thanks devout; nor, being thankful, heeds",
    "The grimy slur on the Republic\u2019s faith implied,",
    "Which holds that Man is naturally good,",
    "And\u2014more\u2014is Nature\u2019s Roman, never to be scourged."

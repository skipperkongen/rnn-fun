    "Looking at Mapplethorpe\u2019s Polaroids, I learn that he",
    "liked shoes and armpit crotch-shots of men and women,",
    "both shaved and un\u2019\u2014all giving a good whiff to the camera.",
    "But best of all are his pictures of ordinary phones",
    "which convey a palpable sense of expectancy as if",
    "at any moment, one of the fabulous, laconic nude men",
    "strewn about might call. One could pick up the receiver",
    "and hear the garbled sound of ancient Greek and Roman",
    "voices reveling in the background. But even when silent,",
    "the dingy phone is a sex organ\u2014cock asleep in its cradle."

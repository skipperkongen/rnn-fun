    "There\u2019s an Isle, a green Isle, set in the sea,",
    "Here\u2019s to the Saint that blessed it!",
    "And here\u2019s to the billows wild and free",
    "That for centuries have caressed it!",
    "Here\u2019s to the day when the men that roam",
    "Send longing eyes o\u2019er the water!",
    "Here\u2019s to the land that still spells home",
    "To each loyal son and daughter!",
    "Here\u2019s to old Ireland\u2014fair, I ween,",
    "With the blue skies stretched above her!",
    "Here\u2019s to her shamrock warm and green,",
    "And here\u2019s to the hearts that love her!"

    "because she needed a lavish taste",
    "on her tongue,",
    "a daily tipple of amber and gold",
    "to waft her into the sky,",
    "a soluble heat trickling down her throat.",
    "Who could blame her",
    "for starting out each morning",
    "with a swig of something furious",
    "in her belly, for days",
    "when she dressed in flashy lame\u0301",
    "leggings like a starlet,",
    "for wriggling and dancing a little madly,",
    "her crazy reels and her rumbas,",
    "for coming home wobbly",
    "with a flicker of clover\u2019s inflorescence",
    "still clinging to her clothes,",
    "enough to light the darkness",
    "of a pitch-black hive."

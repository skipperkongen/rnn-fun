    "It came with those scratches",
    "from all their belt buckles,",
    "palm-dark with their sweat",
    "like the stock of a gun:",
    "an arc of pickmarks cut",
    "clear through the lacquer",
    "where all the players before me",
    "once strummed\u2014once",
    "thumbed these same latches",
    "where it sleeps in green velvet.",
    "Once sang, as I sing, the old songs.",
    "There\u2019s no end, there\u2019s no end",
    "to this world, everlasting.",
    "We crumble to dust in its arms."

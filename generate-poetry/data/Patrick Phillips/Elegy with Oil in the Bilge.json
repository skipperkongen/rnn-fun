    "By the time we got out on the water",
    "the sun was so low, it wasn\u2019t like water",
    "but a field of gray snow that we plowed",
    "in one endless white furrow of water",
    "as I skirted the rocks and wrecked trawlers",
    "and abandoned old jetties just under the water,",
    "while you moaned in the bow, slick with fever,",
    "whispering back to whatever the water",
    "chattered and hissed through the hull\u2014",
    "until at last there were lights on the water",
    "and I let the old Mercury rattle and sputter",
    "its steaming gray rainbows out onto the water",
    "as we drifted, at idle, for the last time in your life,",
    "through that beloved, indifferent harbor."

    "Touched by your goodness, I am like",
    "that grand piano we found one night on Willoughby",
    "that someone had smashed and somehow",
    "heaved through an open window.",
    "And you might think by this I mean I\u2019m broken",
    "or abandoned, or unloved. Truth is, I don\u2019t",
    "know exactly what I am, any more",
    "than the wreckage in the alley knows",
    "it\u2019s a piano, filling with trash and yellow leaves.",
    "Maybe I\u2019m all that\u2019s left of what I was.",
    "But touching me, I know, you are the good",
    "breeze blowing across its rusted strings.",
    "What would you call that feeling when the wood,",
    "even with its cracked harp, starts to sing?"

    "When last we came this pleasant way",
    "The hedgerows blossomed, high and hard,",
    "And blue with shade the violets lay",
    "In every cherry-lightened yard.",
    "Now, in commemorative rain,",
    "I walk the quiet way alone,",
    "And there are violets again",
    "As blue as I have ever known.",
    "Useless to barricade the flesh",
    "To splendid branch and flower-row:",
    "I see the cherry, flaked and fresh,",
    "And smell the violet as I go",
    "Perplexed past wetted flowerbed",
    "And boxwood glimmering into leaf,",
    "Companionless, disquieted,",
    "And fearfully as any thief\u2014",
    "Smarting of some sacrilege",
    "Too profligate to understand,",
    "As one who disavows a pledge",
    "And treads repudiated land."

    "The errand into the maze,",
    "Emblem, the heel\u2019s blow upon space,",
    "Speak of the need and order the dancer\u2019s will.",
    "But the dance is still.",
    "For a surmise of rest, over the flight of the dial,",
    "Between shock of the fall, shock of repose,",
    "The flesh in its time delivered itself to the trial,",
    "And rose.",
    "Suffrance: the lapse, the pause,",
    "Were the will of the dance\u2014",
    "The movement-to-be, charmed from the shifts of the chance,",
    "Intent on its cause.",
    "And the terrible gift",
    "Of the gaze, blind on its zenith, the wreath",
    "Of the throat, the body\u2019s unwearied uplift,",
    "Unmaking and making its death,",
    "Were ripeness, and theme for return:",
    "Were rest, in the durance of matter:",
    "The sleep of the musing Begetter",
    "And the poise in the urn."

    "Rise, cleanly trust, divided star,",
    "And spend that delicate fraud upon the night\u2014",
    "A lover\u2019s instance moving mindful air",
    "To make its peace in dedicated light",
    "Whose look is charnel. Lusters, intent and blind,",
    "Give darkness downward with a glow like sheaves\u2014",
    "A gleaner\u2019s pittance withered in the bind",
    "That keeps the summer godhead of the leaves",
    "And bends tremendous evening under it,",
    "Doubles its theft within a lonely course",
    "Till eye and eye repeat the counterfeit",
    "And shape the replenishing mercy at its source.",
    "All else were ravage: a demon-gaze of terror:",
    "The emblem blackened in the living head,",
    "The eye, the image, and the image-bearer",
    "Struck to an awe with smiling on the dead.",
    "Therefore that bounty which, however false,",
    "Tenders survival, and is purely given,",
    "And lends the viewless prisms at its pulse",
    "To make an easy legendry in heaven.",
    "Indeed, the look is grace",
    "That deals this desert providence in air",
    "And lifts a deathshead, burning, into place",
    "To serve a lover\u2019s faith."

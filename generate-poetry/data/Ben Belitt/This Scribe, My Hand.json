    "of a \u201croomful of people\u201d",
    "but making no mark,",
    "pressing the page as I write,",
    "while the traffic in Rome,",
    "demotic with engines and klaxons,",
    "circles the Pyramid of Cestius,",
    "crosses a graveyard, and submerges",
    "again like the fin of a shark.",
    "I write, in the posthumous way,",
    "on the flat of a headstone",
    "with a quarrier\u2019s ink, like yourself:",
    "an anthologist\u2019s date and an asterisk,",
    "a parenthetical mark in the gas",
    "of the pyramid-builders,",
    "an obelisk whirling with Vespas",
    "in a poisonous motorcade.",

    "the heart in the funeral ashes,",
    "a deathbed with friends.",
    "Something murderous flows",
    "from the page to my hand\u2014",
    "a silence that wars",
    "with the letters, a fist",
    "that closes on paper: a blow",
    "with the straight edge of a razor",
    "that falls with a madman\u2019s",
    "monotony; or the adze",
    "of a sleepwalking Sumerian",
    "nicking the wet of the clay,",
    "hacking a wedge in a tablet",

    "till all glistens with language.",
    "The criminal folds up his claspknife. The shutters",
    "slam down on the streets.",
    "Out of breath with the climb, and",
    "tasting a hashish of blood,",
    "what did he see on the brink",
    "of the Piazza di Spagna? A hand",
    "in the frame of a cithara",
    "where beggars and sunbathers",
    "clotted the levels like musical",

    "what was it I picked",
    "under the epitaph, what",
    "rose to my touch",
    "in the thirst of the marble, a cup",
    "from the well of your grave",
    "in the noonday miasma,",
    "a hieroglyph in the water, saying:",

    "solitude writing on water,",
    "alone with its failure.",
    "You are there",
    "on the underside of the page,",
    "a blue flower in my Baedeker,",
    "writing on water. I know it.",
    "The paper pulls under my pen",
    "peaks into waves",

    "The emptiness hardens",
    "with balustrades, risers, and levels,",
    "a staircase of Roman",
    "azaleas. I slip on the blood and the ink",
    "toward the exigent bed",
    "of a poet. All is precarious. A maniac",
    "waits on the streets. Nobody listens. What",
    "must I do? I am writing on water,",
    "blazing with failures, ascending,",
    "descending among lovers and trippers.",

    "gregarious, an invisible hand in the granite.",
    "The tidal salts drain on a living horizon,",
    "leaving a glare on the blemishing",
    "paper. The silence is mortal."

    "As a child I danced",
    "to the heartful, savage",
    "rhythm",
    "of the Native, the",
    "American Indian,",
    "in the Turtle Mountains,",
    "in the Round Hall,",
    "in the greasy light of",
    "kerosene lamps.",
    "As a child I danced",
    "among the long, jangle legs of",
    "the men, down",
    "beside the whispering moccasin women,",
    "in close circles",
    "around the Old Ones,",
    "who sat at the drum,",
    "their heads tossed, backs arched",
    "in ancient prayer.",
    "As a child I danced away from the fist,",
    "I danced toward the rhythms of life,",
    "I danced into dreams, into",
    "the sound of flies buzzing.",
    "A deer advancing but clinging to the forest wall,",
    "the old red woman rocking in her tattered shawl,",
    "the young women bent, breasts",
    "drooping to the mouths of their young, the heat",
    "hanging heavy on the tips of our tongues,",
    "until the Sun",
    "burned the sky black, the moon",
    "made us silvery blue and",
    "all of the night sounds, all of the night sounds",
    "folded together with the buzzing",
    "still in our heads,",
    "becoming a chant of ghosts,",
    "of",
    "and",
    "and all the Endless Others,",
    "snaking through the weaving through the trees",
    "like beams of ribbons of light,",
    "singing,",
    ",",
    "until the Sun and the Sun and the Sun and I",
    "awaken,",
    "still a child, still dancing",
    "toward the rhythm of life."

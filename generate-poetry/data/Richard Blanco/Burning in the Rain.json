    "Someday compassion would demand",
    "I set myself free of my desire to recreate",
    "my father, indulge in my mother\u2019s losses,",
    "strangle lovers with words, forcing them",
    "to confess for me and take the blame.",
    "Today was that day: I tossed them, sheet",
    "by sheet on the patio and gathered them",
    "into a pyre. I wanted to let them go",
    "in a blaze, tiny white dwarfs imploding",
    "beside the azaleas and ficus bushes,",
    "let them crackle, burst like winged seeds,",
    "let them smolder into gossamer embers\u2014",
    "a thousand gray butterflies in the wind.",
    "Today was that day, but it rained, kept",
    "raining. Instead of fire, water\u2014drops",
    "knocking on doors, wetting windows",
    "into mirrors reflecting me in the oaks.",
    "The garden walls and stones swelling",
    "into ghostlier shades of themselves,",
    "the wind chimes giggling in the storm,",
    "a coffee cup left overflowing with rain.",
    "Instead of burning, my pages turned",
    "into water lilies floating over puddles,",
    "then tiny white cliffs as the sun set,",
    "finally drying all night under the moon",
    "into papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 souvenirs. Today",
    "the rain would not let their lives burn."

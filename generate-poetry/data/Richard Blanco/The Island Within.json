    "I\u2019m still thinking about your porch light",
    "like a full moon casting a foggy halo",
    "in the frigid air last night, the bare oaks",
    "branching into the sky like nerve endings",
    "inches away from the frozen stars,",
    "the pink gables of your Victorian home",
    "protesting yet another winter for you",
    "captive in Ann Arbor as you practice",
    "mambo by the fireplace. I\u2019m following",
    "your red-velvet shoes to conga beats",
    "and bongo taps taking your body, but",
    "not your life, from the snow mantling",
    "your windows outside, 1,600 miles",
    "away from Cuba. I\u2019m tasting the",
    "you made, the slice of homemade flan",
    "floating in burnt sugar like the stories",
    "you told me you can\u2019t finish writing,",
    "no matter how many times you travel",
    "through time back to Havana to steal",
    "every memory ever stolen from you.",
    "You\u2019re a thief anyone would forgive,",
    "wanting only to imagine faces for names",
    "chiseled on the graves of your family",
    "at Guanabacoa, walk on Calle Aguacate",
    "and pretend to meet the grandfather",
    "you never met at his lace shop for lunch,",
    "or pray the Kaddish like your mother",
    "at the synagogue in El Vedado, stand",
    "on the steps there like you once did",
    "in a photo you can\u2019t remember taking.",
    "I confess I pitied you, still trying to reach",
    "that unreachable island within the island",
    "you still call home. I thought I was done",
    "with Cuba, tired of filling in the blanks,",
    "but now I\u2019m not sure. Maybe if I return",
    "just once more, walk the sugarcane fields",
    "my father once cut, drive down the road",
    "where my mother once peddled guavas",
    "to pay for textbooks, sit on the porch",
    "of my grandmother\u2019s house, imagine her",
    "still in the kitchen making",
    "\u2014",
    "maybe then I\u2019ll have an answer for you",
    "last night when you asked me:"

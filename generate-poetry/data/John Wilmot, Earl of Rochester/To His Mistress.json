    "Why dost thou shade thy lovely face? O why",
    "Does that eclipsing hand of thine deny",
    "The sunshine of the Sun\u2019s enlivening eye?",
    "Without thy light what light remains in me?",
    "Thou art my life; my way, my light\u2019s in thee;",
    "I live, I move, and by thy beams I see.",
    "Thou art my life-if thou but turn away",
    "My life\u2019s a thousand deaths. Thou art my way-",
    "Without thee, Love, I travel not but stray.",
    "My light thou art-without thy glorious sight",
    "My eyes are darken\u2019d with eternal night.",
    "My Love, thou art my way, my life, my light.",
    "Thou art my way; I wander if thou fly.",
    "Thou art my light; if hid, how blind am I!",
    "Thou art my life; if thou withdraw\u2019st, I die.",
    "My eyes are dark and blind, I cannot see:",
    "To whom or whither should my darkness flee,",
    "But to that light?-and who\u2019s that light but thee?",
    "If I have lost my path, dear lover, say,",
    "Shall I still wander in a doubtful way?",
    "Love, shall a lamb of Israel\u2019s sheepfold stray?",
    "My path is lost, my wandering steps do stray;",
    "I cannot go, nor can I safely stay;",
    "Whom should I seek but thee, my path, my way?",
    "And yet thou turn\u2019st thy face away and fly\u2019st me!",
    "And yet I sue for grace and thou deny\u2019st me!",
    "Speak, art thou angry, Love, or only try\u2019st me?",
    "Thou art the pilgrim\u2019s path, the blind man\u2019s eye,",
    "The dead man\u2019s life. On thee my hopes rely:",
    "If I but them remove, I surely die.",
    "Dissolve thy sunbeams, close thy wings and stay!",
    "See, see how I am blind, and dead, and stray!",
    "-O thou art my life, my light, my way!",
    "Then work thy will! If passion bid me flee,",
    "My reason shall obey, my wings shall be",
    "Stretch\u2019d out no farther than from me to thee!"

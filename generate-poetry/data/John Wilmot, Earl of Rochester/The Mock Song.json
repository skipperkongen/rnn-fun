    "Alas I am, alas I am a whore.",
    "Were all my body larded o\u2019er,",
    "With darts of love, so thick,",
    "That you might find in ev\u2019ry pore,",
    "A well stuck standing prick;",
    "Whilst yet my eyes alone were free,",
    "My heart, would never doubt,",
    "In am\u2019rous rage, and ecstasy,",
    "To wish those eyes, to wish those eyes fucked out."

    "NONES",
    "At three p.m.",
    "under sky coming to harm",
    "something too red flashes from a limb,",
    "so red it hurts:",
    "against sky coming apart,",
    "against a left-out, twice-soaked shirt,",
    "a cardinal",
    "inflames the profane cathedral",
    "of suburban yard its owner let fall",
    "into disgrace.",
    "How rain embarrasses",
    "the half-pruned hedge. The half-mown grass",
    "that sports a tonsure",
    "in reverse shines under the torture.",
    "Rain slicks with praise red shed, red feather.",
    "Crested seedeater",
    "out of character where",
    "you\u2019re neither the strictly monkish brown thrasher",
    "nor the odd hermit thrush,",
    "you scratch in the underbrush",
    "of faith to see what you can flush:",
    "a grub. A seed.",
    "not",
    "but",
    ", from your lipsticked beak",
    "you pass a sowbug",
    "to your mate. You peck at a slug",
    "sliming your path, seeming to beg",
    "your forgiveness.",
    "To what would you confess",
    "beyond season-to-season unfaithfulness?",
    "VESPERS",
    "There are more divine hours:",
    "a gold-leafed page a mower",
    "rows with a scythe as tall as the tower",
    "that tents aloft",
    "a tiny sky bereft",
    "of cloud, a chapel ceiling left",
    "unstarred, heaven",
    "a lake turned upside down,",
    "filled with an emptiness that\u2019s clean",
    "because it\u2019s cold,",
    "glacial enough to scald",
    "the skin it bathed, the lungs it filled.",
    "On devotion\u2019s last page,",
    "deep in the golden age",
    "of illumination, the hunt\u2019s cort\u00e8ge",
    "has halted at the edge",
    "of the known world, a clearing wedged",
    "in a forest of spears. Red bird the badge",
    "on the huntsman\u2019s tunic,",
    "you\u2019re the splash of crimson lake,",
    "the distant lordship\u2019s flag, the cleric",
    "dog\u2019s bright collar,",
    "its heretic tongue. It slavers",
    "on the bleeding stag. Snarling at prayer",
    "that chases belief,",
    "it licks the offal of grief,",
    "the heart cast aside reward enough."

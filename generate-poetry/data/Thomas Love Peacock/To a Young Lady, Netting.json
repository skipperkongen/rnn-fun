    "While those bewitching hands combine,",
    "With matchless grace, the silken line,",
    "They also weave, with gentle art,",
    "Those stronger nets that bind the heart.",
    "But soon all earthly things decay:",
    "That net in time must wear away:",
    "E\u2019en Beauty\u2019s silken meshes gay",
    "No lasting hold can take:",
    "But Beauty, Virtue, Sense, combin\u2019d,",
    "(And all these charms in thee are join\u2019d)",
    "Can throw that net upon the mind,",
    "No human art can e\u2019er unbind,",
    "No human pow\u2019r can break."

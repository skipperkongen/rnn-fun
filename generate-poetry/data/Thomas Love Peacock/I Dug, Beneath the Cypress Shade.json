    "I dug, beneath the cypress shade,",
    "What well might seem an elfin's grave;",
    "And every pledge in earth I laid,",
    "That erst thy false affection gave.",
    "I pressed them down the sod beneath;",
    "I placed one mossy stone above;",
    "And twined the rose's fading wreath",
    "Around the sepulchre of love.",
    "Frail as thy love, the flowers were dead,",
    "Ere yet the evening sun was set:",
    "But years shall see the cypress spread,",
    "Immutable as my regret."

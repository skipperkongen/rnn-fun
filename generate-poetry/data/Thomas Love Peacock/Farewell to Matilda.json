    "Matilda, farewell! Fate has doom\u2019d us to part,",
    "But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart;",
    "No longer is love with my reason at strife,",
    "Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life.",
    "As together we roam\u2019d, I the passion confess\u2019d,",
    "Which thy beauty and virtue had rais\u2019d in my breast;",
    "That the passion was mutual thou mad\u2019st me believe,",
    "And I thought",
    "Matilda could never deceive.",
    "Matilda! no, false one! my claims I resign:",
    "Thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine:",
    "I now scorn thee as much as I lov\u2019d thee before,",
    "Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more.",
    "Though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find,",
    "While folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind,",
    "Though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize,",
    "Thou art shunn\u2019d by the good, and contemn\u2019d by the wise.",
    "Than mine what affection more fervent could be,",
    "When I thought ev\u2019ry virtue was center\u2019d in thee?",
    "Of the vows thou hast broken I will not complain,",
    "For I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain.",
    "Oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov\u2019d",
    "As that",
    "I formerly lov\u2019d,",
    "Nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul,",
    "Could have dimm\u2019d the dear image then stamp\u2019d on my soul.",
    "How bright were the pictures, untinted with shade,",
    "By Hope\u2019s glowing pencil on Fancy pourtray\u2019d!",
    "Sweet visions of bliss! which I could not retain;",
    "For they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain.",
    "Some other, perhaps, to Matilda is dear,",
    "Some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere;",
    "May he fix thy light passions, now wav\u2019ring as air,",
    "Then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair!",
    "Repent not, Matilda, return not to me:",
    "Unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be:",
    "In vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum\u2019d,",
    "For love, once extinguish\u2019d, is never relum\u2019d."

    "The whit\u2019ning ground",
    "In frost is bound;",
    "The snow is swiftly falling;",
    "While coldly blows the northern breeze,",
    "And whistles through the leafless trees,",
    "In hollow sounds appalling.",
    "On this cold plain,",
    "Now reach\u2019d with pain,",
    "Once stood my father\u2019s dwelling:",
    "Where smiling pleasure once was found,",
    "Now desolation frowns around,",
    "And wintry blasts are yelling.",
    "Hope\u2019s visions wild",
    "My thoughts beguil\u2019d,",
    "My earliest days delighting,",
    "Till unsuspected treach\u2019ry came,",
    "Beneath affection\u2019s specious name,",
    "The lovely prospect blighting.",
    "With many a wile",
    "Of blackest guile",
    "Did Henry first deceive me:",
    "What winning words to him were giv\u2019n!",
    "He swore, by all the pow\u2019rs of Heav\u2019n,",
    "That he would never leave me.",
    "With fondest truth",
    "I lov\u2019d the youth:",
    "My soul, to guilt a stranger,",
    "Knew not, in those too simple hours,",
    "That oft beneath the sweetest flow\u2019rs",
    "Is couch\u2019d the deadliest danger.",
    "With him to roam",
    "I fled my home;",
    "I burst the bonds of duty;",
    "I thought my days in joy would roll;",
    "But Henry hid a demon\u2019s soul",
    "Beneath an angel\u2019s beauty!",
    "Shall this poor heart",
    "E\u2019er cease to smart?",
    "Oh never! never! never!",
    "Did av\u2019rice whisper thee, or pride,",
    "False Henry! for a wealthier bride",
    "To cast me off for ever?",
    "My sire was poor:",
    "No golden store",
    "Had he, no earthly treasure:",
    "I only could his griefs assuage,",
    "The only pillar of his age,",
    "His only source of pleasure.",
    "With anguish wild,",
    "He miss\u2019d his child,",
    "And long in vain he sought her:",
    "The fiercest thunder-bolts of heav\u2019n",
    "Shall on thy guilty head be driv\u2019n,",
    "Thou Disobedient Daughter!",
    "I feel his fears,",
    "I see his tears,",
    "I hear his groans of sadness:",
    "My cruel falsehood seal\u2019d his doom:",
    "He seems to curse me from the tomb,",
    "And fire my brain to madness!",
    "Oh! keenly blow,",
    "While drifts the snow,",
    "The cold nocturnal breezes;",
    "On me the gath\u2019ring snow-flakes rest,",
    "And colder grows my friendless breast;",
    "My very heart-blood freezes!",
    "\u2018Tis midnight deep,",
    "And thousands sleep,",
    "Unknown to guilt and sorrow;",
    "They think not of a wretch like me,",
    "Who cannot, dare not, hope to see",
    "The rising light to-morrow!",
    "An outcast hurl\u2019d",
    "From all the world,",
    "Whom none would love or cherish,",
    "What now remains to end my woes,",
    "But here, amid the deep\u2019ning snows,",
    "To lay me down and perish?",
    "Death\u2019s icy dart",
    "Invades my heart:",
    "Just Heav\u2019n! all-good! all-seeing!",
    "Thy matchless mercy I implore,",
    "When I must wake, to sleep no more,",
    "In realms of endless being!"

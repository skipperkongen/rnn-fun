    "The day has pass\u2019d in storms, though not unmix\u2019d",
    "With transitory calm. The western clouds,",
    "Dissolving slow, unveil the glorious sun,",
    "Majestic in decline. The wat\u2019ry east",
    "Glows with the many-tinted arch of Heav\u2019n.",
    "We hail it as a pledge that brighter skies",
    "Shall bless the coming morn. Thus rolls the day,",
    "The short dark day of life; with tempests thus,",
    "And fleeting sun-shine chequer\u2019d. At its close,",
    "When the dread hour draws near, that bursts all ties,",
    "All commerce with the world, Religion pours",
    "Hope\u2019s fairy-colors on the virtuous mind,",
    "And, like the rain-bow on the ev\u2019ning clouds,",
    "Gives the bright promise that a happier dawn",
    "Shall chase the night and silence of the grave."

    "Behold the gloomy tyrant\u2019s awful form",
    "Binding the captive earth in icy chains;",
    "His chilling breath sweeps o\u2019er the watery plains,",
    "Howls in the blast, and swells the rising storm.",
    "See from its centre bends the rifted tower,",
    "Threat\u2019ning the lowly vale with frowning pride,",
    "O\u2019er the scared flocks that seek its sheltering side,",
    "A fearful ruin o\u2019er their heads to pour.",
    "While to the cheerful hearth and social board",
    "Content and ease repair, the sons of want",
    "Receive from niggard fate their pittance scant;",
    "And where some shed bleak covert may afford,",
    "Wan poverty, amidst her meagre host",
    "Casts round her haggard eyes, and shivers at the frost."

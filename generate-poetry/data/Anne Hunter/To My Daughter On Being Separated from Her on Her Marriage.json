    "Dear to my heart as life\u2019s warm stream",
    "Which animates this mortal clay,",
    "For thee I court the waking dream,",
    "And deck with smiles the future day;",
    "And thus beguile the present pain",
    "With hopes that we shall meet again.",
    "Yet, will it be as when the past",
    "Twined every joy, and care, and thought,",
    "And o\u2019er our minds one mantle cast",
    "Of kind affections finely wrought?",
    "Ah no! the groundless hope were vain,",
    "For so we ne\u2019er can meet again!",
    "May he who claims thy tender heart",
    "Deserve its love, as I have done!",
    "For, kind and gentle as thou art,",
    "If so beloved, thou art fairly won.",
    "Bright may the sacred torch remain,",
    "And cheer thee till we meet again!"

    "The sniper at work over the street corner acts.",
    "Two girls, breathless after the dash across,",
    "radiate heat and bouquets, as when ironing",
    "silken delicates. With one, in place of a chignon,",
    "goosefleshed Christmas wheat. She explodes, rages,",
    "curses the sniper; at the window, seemingly,",
    "I'm watching a beautiful storm. From the other, words",
    "like a sun-umbrella's flutterings, in the morning,",
    "on an Adriatic beach. Now and again, she flicks her head",
    "back: just for us. As she well knows: flicked hair",
    "sweetens the air. Beauty, always forthcoming, never",
    "misses a half-smile. As they well know: making us happy",
    "costs them nothing. Those half-smiles saying",
    "\u2014not at all,",
    "not for them\u2014even banishing the hex of that fact",
    "if any other woman's glacial look had magicked it up.",
    "The air smelt strongly of my distant youth",
    "when every boulevard led to the end of the world,",
    "when life was not yet \"threadbare as a proverb.\"",
    "Now they're going, leaving such tenderness in me",
    "as engulfs you when looking too long at the heavens",
    "into which snowflakes are swarming.",
    "So they disappeared chattering, not girls",
    "but breezes, blown lightly, surprisingly,",
    "through the St. John's heat of siege. The St. John's heat",
    "of being."

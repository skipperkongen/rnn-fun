    "The irritations of comfort\u2014",
    "I visit as they rebuild the house",
    "from within: whitening, straightening,",
    "bracing the chimney-breast edges",
    "and forcing warmth, dryness",
    "and windows with views into",
    "the cottage below canal-level.",
    "For yes, there\u2019s a canal, bringing",
    "cold reflections almost to the door,",
    "and beyond it the main line to Manchester,",
    "its grid of gantries pale",
    "against the upland and the sky;",
    "there\u2019s a towpath pub, where the red-",
    "haired old landlady",
    "brings up the beer from the cellar slowly",
    "in a jug: there\u2019s a chapel",
    "next door to the cottage, set up",
    "with a false front and a real",
    "boiler-house, and\u2014",
    "rest, my mind\u2014nearby there\u2019s",
    "a small haulage contractor\u2019s yard.",
    "Everything\u2019s turned up here, except",
    "a certain complete cast-iron",
    "housefront, preserved and pinned",
    "to a blank wall in Ottawa.",
    "This comfort",
    "beckons. It won\u2019t do. It beckons.",
    "Driving steadily through rain in",
    "a watertight car with the wipers going.",
    "It won\u2019t do. It beckons."

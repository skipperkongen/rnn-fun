    "After Independence Day",
    "all our toys began to tear",
    "up, school growing sweet",
    "on our tongues. We had",
    "already cut & hoed",
    "the cotton into rows, weeds",
    "piled useless as Confederate",
    "bills. September meant picking",
    "& half-days at Springfield, us colored",
    "grades let off at noon to pick",
    "the valuable white till",
    "nightfall. My hands, civil",
    "& slow, didn\u2019t even deserve",
    "my behind on the picking truck,",
    "but Unc Chock ran the thing",
    "& Mama would\u2019ve killed him dead",
    "if he\u2019d dreamt of trying",
    "to get salty. The money was bad",
    "like all money then, not near",
    "as green or wide. Three dollars",
    "for a hundred pounds, better part",
    "of a day. I barely kept up, hands swole up",
    "like unpicked fruit. No matter when",
    "she started, Frankie plucked fifteen pounds",
    "more, food for two, a new",
    "Easter dress. Summers I turned",
    "so black & bent, all because I\u2019d rather",
    "pick with friends than sling weeds",
    "alone, than stuff my mattress green.",
    "Winters, when the white king",
    "had gone, we slept like fish, still",
    "moving. We walked back home",
    "for lunch & retraced after school, changing",
    "into our other pair of drawers",
    "before we chored the stove\u2019s ash. No one",
    "got gas till after the War. Each November",
    "brought a boxcar from the Atchison",
    "Topeka & Santa Fe; for a share,",
    "Lopez balanced it home on his flatbed,",
    "a whale from the hunt. Once full",
    "of hobos, that bell we burnt kept us",
    "from freezing all season long. Before",
    "tossing each board in, I would run",
    "my hands across the wood speech",
    "of burns, carvings warning",
    "Unfriendly Conductor, Town of No",
    "Sleep. Leftover wood turned",
    "to toys; three boards & somebody\u2019s",
    "old rollerskate became a summer",
    "scooter. Bored, what was that?",
    "We were too busy being poor",
    "in that house air-conditioned all winter,",
    "too busy sharing everything, even",
    "bathwater evenings by the pipe stove.",
    "No plumbing, no rats, only mice thick",
    "enough to believe we had more",
    "than they did."

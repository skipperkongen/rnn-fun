    "An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King;",
    "Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow",
    "Through public scorn,\u2014mud from a muddy spring;",
    "Rulers who neither see nor feel nor know,",
    "But leechlike to their fainting country cling",
    "Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow.",
    "A people starved and stabbed in th' untilled field;",
    "An army, whom liberticide and prey",
    "Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;",
    "Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;",
    "Religion Christless, Godless\u2014a book sealed;",
    "A senate, Time\u2019s worst statute, unrepealed\u2014",
    "Are graves from which a glorious Phantom may",
    "Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day."

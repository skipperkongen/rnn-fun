    "I arise from dreams of thee",
    "In the first sweet sleep of night,",
    "When the winds are breathing low,",
    "And the stars are shining bright:",
    "I arise from dreams of thee,",
    "And a spirit in my feet",
    "Hath led me\u0097who knows how?",
    "To thy chamber window, Sweet!",
    "The wandering airs they faint",
    "On the dark, the silent stream\u0097",
    "The Champak odours fail",
    "Like sweet thoughts in a dream;",
    "The Nightingale's complaint,",
    "It dies upon her heart;\u0097",
    "As I must on thine,",
    "Oh, belov\u00e8d as thou art!",
    "Oh lift me from the grass!",
    "I die! I faint! I fail!",
    "Let thy love in kisses rain",
    "On my lips and eyelids pale.",
    "My cheek is cold and white, alas!",
    "My heart beats loud and fast;\u0097",
    "Oh! press it to thine own again,",
    "Where it will break at last."

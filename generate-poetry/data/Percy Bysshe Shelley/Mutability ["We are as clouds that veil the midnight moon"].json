    "I.",
    "We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;",

    "II.",

    "Give various response to each varying blast,",
    "To whose frail frame no second motion brings",
    "One mood or modulation like the last.",
    "III.",
    "We rest\u2014a dream has power to poison sleep;",
    "We rise\u2014one wandering thought pollutes the day;",
    "We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep,",
    "Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:\u2014",

    "The path of its departure still is free;",
    "Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;",
    "Nought may endure but Mutability."

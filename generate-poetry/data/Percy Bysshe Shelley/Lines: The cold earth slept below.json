    "The cold earth slept below;",
    "Above the cold sky shone;",
    "And all around,",
    "With a chilling sound,",
    "From caves of ice and fields of snow",
    "The breath of night like death did flow",
    "Beneath the sinking moon.",
    "The wintry hedge was black;",
    "The green grass was not seen;",
    "The birds did rest",
    "On the bare thorn\u2019s breast,",
    "Whose roots, beside the pathway track,",
    "Had bound their folds o\u2019er many a crack",
    "Which the frost had made between.",
    "Thine eyes glow\u2019d in the glare",
    "Of the moon\u2019s dying light;",
    "As a fen-fire\u2019s beam",
    "On a sluggish stream",
    "Gleams dimly\u2014so the moon shone there,",
    "And it yellow\u2019d the strings of thy tangled hair,",
    "That shook in the wind of night.",
    "The moon made thy lips pale, beloved;",
    "The wind made thy bosom chill;",
    "The night did shed",
    "On thy dear head",
    "Its frozen dew, and thou didst lie",
    "Where the bitter breath of the naked sky",
    "Might visit thee at will."

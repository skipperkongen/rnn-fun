    "\u201cMother dear, may I go downtown",
    "Instead of out to play,",
    "And march the streets of Birmingham",
    "In a Freedom March today?\u201d",
    "\u201cNo, baby, no, you may not go,",
    "For the dogs are fierce and wild,",
    "And clubs and hoses, guns and jails",
    "Aren\u2019t good for a little child.\u201d",
    "\u201cBut, mother, I won\u2019t be alone.",
    "Other children will go with me,",
    "And march the streets of Birmingham",
    "To make our country free.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo, baby, no, you may not go,",
    "For I fear those guns will fire.",
    "But you may go to church instead",
    "And sing in the children\u2019s choir.\u201d",
    "She has combed and brushed her night-dark hair,",
    "And bathed rose petal sweet,",
    "And drawn white gloves on her small brown hands,",
    "And white shoes on her feet.",
    "The mother smiled to know her child",
    "Was in the sacred place,",
    "But that smile was the last smile",
    "To come upon her face.",
    "For when she heard the explosion,",
    "Her eyes grew wet and wild.",
    "She raced through the streets of Birmingham",
    "Calling for her child.",
    "She clawed through bits of glass and brick,",
    "Then lifted out a shoe.",
    "\u201cO, here\u2019s the shoe my baby wore,",
    "But, baby, where are you?\u201d"

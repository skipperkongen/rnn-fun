    "Never the time and the place",
    "And the loved one all together!",
    "This path\u0097how soft to pace!",
    "This May\u0097what magic weather!",
    "Where is the loved one's face?",
    "In a dream that loved one's face meets mine,",
    "But the house is narrow, the place is bleak",
    "Where, outside, rain and wind combine",
    "With a furtive ear, if I strive to speak,",
    "With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek,",
    "With a malice that marks each word, each sign!",
    "O enemy sly and serpentine,",
    "Uncoil thee from the waking man!",
    "Do I hold the Past",
    "Thus firm and fast",
    "Yet doubt if the Future hold I can?",
    "This path so soft to pace shall lead",
    "Thro' the magic of May to herself indeed!",
    "Or narrow if needs the house must be,",
    "Outside are the storms and strangers: we",
    "Oh, close, safe, warm sleep I and she,\u0097",
    "I and she!"

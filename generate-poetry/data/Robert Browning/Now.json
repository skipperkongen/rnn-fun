    "Out of your whole life give but one moment!",
    "All of your life that has gone before,",
    "All to come after it, \u2013 so you ignore,",
    "So you make perfect the present, \u2013 condense,",
    "In a rapture of rage, for perfection\u2019s endowment,",
    "Thought and feeling and soul and sense \u2013",
    "Merged in a moment which gives me at last",
    "You around me for once, you beneath me, above me \u2013",
    "Me \u2013 sure that despite of time future, time past, \u2013",
    "This tick of our life-time\u2019s one moment you love me!",
    "How long such suspension may linger? Ah, Sweet \u2013",
    "The moment eternal \u2013 just that and no more \u2013",
    "When ecstasy\u2019s utmost we clutch at the core",
    "While cheeks burn, arms open, eyes shut and lips meet!"

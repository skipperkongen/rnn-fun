    "Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-West died away;",
    "Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;",
    "Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;",
    "In the dimmest North-East distance, dawned Gibraltar grand and gray;",
    "\"Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?\"\u0097say,",
    "Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God to praise and pray,",
    "While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa."

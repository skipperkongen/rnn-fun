    "All\u2019s over, then: does truth sound bitter",
    "As one at first believes?",
    "Hark, \u2019tis the sparrows\u2019 good-night twitter",
    "About your cottage eaves!",
    "And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,",
    "I noticed that, today;",
    "One day more bursts them open fully",
    "\u2013 You know the red turns grey.",
    "Tomorrow we meet the same then, dearest?",
    "May I take your hand in mine?",
    "Mere friends are we, \u2013 well, friends the merest",
    "Keep much that I resign:",
    "For each glance of the eye so bright and black,",
    "Though I keep with heart\u2019s endeavor, \u2013",
    "Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back,",
    "Though it stay in my soul for ever! \u2013",
    "Yet I will but say what mere friends say,",
    "Or only a thought stronger;",
    "I will hold your hand but as long as all may,",
    "Or so very little longer!"

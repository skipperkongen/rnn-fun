    "Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly,",
    "May gaze thro\u2019 these faint smokes curling whitely,",
    "As thou pliest thy trade in this devil\u2019s-smithy\u2014",
    "Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?",
    "He is with her, and they know that I know",
    "Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow",
    "While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear",
    "Empty church, to pray God in, for them!\u2014I am here.",
    "Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste,",
    "Pound at thy powder,\u2014I am not in haste!",
    "Better sit thus and observe thy strange things,",
    "Than go where men wait me and dance at the King\u2019s.",
    "That in the mortar\u2014you call it a gum?",
    "Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come!",
    "And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,",
    "Sure to taste sweetly,\u2014is that poison too?",
    "Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures,",
    "What a wild crowd of invisible pleasures!",
    "To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,",
    "A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!",
    "Soon, at the King\u2019s, a mere lozenge to give",
    "And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live!",
    "But to light a pastile, and Elise, with her head",
    "And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!",
    "Quick\u2014is it finished? The colour\u2019s too grim!",
    "Why not soft like the phial\u2019s, enticing and dim?",
    "Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir,",
    "And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!",
    "What a drop! She\u2019s not little, no minion like me\u2014",
    "That\u2019s why she ensnared him: this never will free",
    "The soul from those masculine eyes,\u2014say, \u201cno!\u201d",
    "To that pulse\u2019s magnificent come-and-go.",
    "For only last night, as they whispered, I brought",
    "My own eyes to bear on her so, that I thought",
    "Could I keep them one half minute fixed, she would fall,",
    "Shrivelled; she fell not; yet this does it all!",
    "Not that I bid you spare her the pain!",
    "Let death be felt and the proof remain;",
    "Brand, burn up, bite into its grace\u2014",
    "He is sure to remember her dying face!",
    "Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;",
    "It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close:",
    "The delicate droplet, my whole fortune\u2019s fee\u2014",
    "If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?",
    "Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill,",
    "You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!",
    "But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings",
    "Ere I know it\u2014next moment I dance at the King\u2019s!"

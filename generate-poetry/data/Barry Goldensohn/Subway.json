    "The station platform, clean and broad, his stage",
    "for push-ups, sit-ups, hamstring stretch,",
    "as he laid aside his back pack, from which",
    "his necessaries bulged, as he bulged",
    "through jeans torn at butt, knee and thigh,",
    "in deep palaver with himself\u2014sigh,",
    "chatter, groan. Deranged but common.",
    "We sat at a careful distance to spy",
    "on his performance, beside a woman",
    "in her thirties, dressed as in her teens\u2014",
    "this is L.A.\u2014singing to herself.",
    "How composed, complete and sane",
    "she seemed. A book by the Dalai Lama",
    "in her hands, her face where pain and wrong",
    "were etched, here becalmed, with faint chirps",
    "leaking from the headphones of her walkman.",
    "Not talking. Singing, lost in song."

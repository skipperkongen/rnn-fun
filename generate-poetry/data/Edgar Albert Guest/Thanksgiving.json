    "Gettin\u2019 together to smile an\u2019 rejoice,",
    "An\u2019 eatin\u2019 an\u2019 laughin\u2019 with folks of your choice;",
    "An\u2019 kissin\u2019 the girls an\u2019 declarin\u2019 that they",
    "Are growin\u2019 more beautiful day after day;",
    "Chattin\u2019 an\u2019 braggin\u2019 a bit with the men,",
    "Buildin\u2019 the old family circle again;",
    "Livin\u2019 the wholesome an\u2019 old-fashioned cheer,",
    "Just for awhile at the end of the year.",
    "Greetings fly fast as we crowd through the door",
    "And under the old roof we gather once more",
    "Just as we did when the youngsters were small;",
    "Mother\u2019s a little bit grayer, that\u2019s all.",
    "Father\u2019s a little bit older, but still",
    "Ready to romp an\u2019 to laugh with a will.",
    "Here we are back at the table again",
    "Tellin\u2019 our stories as women an\u2019 men.",
    "Bowed are our heads for a moment in prayer;",
    "Oh, but we\u2019re grateful an\u2019 glad to be there.",
    "Home from the east land an\u2019 home from the west,",
    "Home with the folks that are dearest an\u2019 best.",
    "Out of the sham of the cities afar",
    "We\u2019ve come for a time to be just what we are.",
    "Here we can talk of ourselves an\u2019 be frank,",
    "Forgettin\u2019 position an\u2019 station an\u2019 rank.",
    "Give me the end of the year an\u2019 its fun",
    "When most of the plannin\u2019 an\u2019 toilin\u2019 is done;",
    "Bring all the wanderers home to the nest,",
    "Let me sit down with the ones I love best,",
    "Hear the old voices still ringin\u2019 with song,",
    "See the old faces unblemished by wrong,",
    "See the old table with all of its chairs",
    "An\u2019 I\u2019ll put soul in my Thanksgivin\u2019 prayers."

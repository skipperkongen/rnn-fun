    "It takes a heap o\u2019 livin\u2019 in a house t\u2019 make it home,",
    "A heap o\u2019 sun an\u2019 shadder, an\u2019 ye sometimes have t\u2019 roam",
    "Afore ye really \u2019preciate the things ye lef\u2019 behind,",
    "An\u2019 hunger fer \u2019em somehow, with \u2019em allus on yer mind.",
    "It don\u2019t make any differunce how rich ye get t\u2019 be,",
    "How much yer chairs an\u2019 tables cost, how great yer luxury;",
    "It ain\u2019t home t\u2019 ye, though it be the palace of a king,",
    "Until somehow yer soul is sort o\u2019 wrapped round everything.",
    "Home ain\u2019t a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute;",
    "Afore it\u2019s home there\u2019s got t\u2019 be a heap o\u2019 livin\u2019 in it;",
    "Within the walls there\u2019s got t\u2019 be some babies born, and then",
    "Right there ye\u2019ve got t\u2019 bring \u2018em up t\u2019 women good, an\u2019 men;",
    "And gradjerly, as time goes on, ye find ye wouldn\u2019t part",
    "With anything they ever used\u2014they\u2019ve grown into yer heart:",
    "The old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they wore",
    "Ye hoard; an\u2019 if ye could ye\u2019d keep the thumbmarks on the door.",
    "Ye\u2019ve got t\u2019 weep t\u2019 make it home, ye\u2019ve got t\u2019 sit an\u2019 sigh",
    "An\u2019 watch beside a loved one\u2019s bed, an\u2019 know that Death is nigh;",
    "An\u2019 in the stillness o\u2019 the night t\u2019 see Death\u2019s angel come,",
    "An\u2019 close the eyes o\u2019 her that smiled, an\u2019 leave her sweet voice dumb.",
    "Fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an\u2019 when yer tears are dried,",
    "Ye find the home is dearer than it was, an\u2019 sanctified;",
    "An\u2019 tuggin\u2019 at ye always are the pleasant memories",
    "O\u2019 her that was an\u2019 is no more\u2014ye can\u2019t escape from these.",
    "Ye\u2019ve got t\u2019 sing an\u2019 dance fer years, ye\u2019ve got t\u2019 romp an\u2019 play,",
    "An\u2019 learn t\u2019 love the things ye have by usin\u2019 \u2019em each day;",
    "Even the roses \u2019round the porch must blossom year by year",
    "Afore they \u2019come a part o\u2019 ye, suggestin\u2019 someone dear",
    "Who used t\u2019 love \u2019em long ago, an\u2019 trained \u2019em jes\u2019 t\u2019 run",
    "The way they do, so\u2019s they would get the early mornin\u2019 sun;",
    "Ye\u2019ve got t\u2019 love each brick an\u2019 stone from cellar up t\u2019 dome:",

    "Somebody said that it couldn\u2019t be done",
    "But he with a chuckle replied",
    "That \u201cmaybe it couldn\u2019t,\u201d but he would be one",
    "Who wouldn\u2019t say so till he\u2019d tried.",
    "So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin",
    "On his face. If he worried he hid it.",
    "He started to sing as he tackled the thing",
    "That couldn\u2019t be done, and he did it!",
    "Somebody scoffed: \u201cOh, you\u2019ll never do that;",
    "At least no one ever has done it;\u201d",
    "But he took off his coat and he took off his hat",
    "And the first thing we knew he\u2019d begun it.",
    "With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,",
    "Without any doubting or quiddit,",
    "He started to sing as he tackled the thing",
    "That couldn\u2019t be done, and he did it.",
    "There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,",
    "There are thousands to prophesy failure,",
    "There are thousands to point out to you one by one,",
    "The dangers that wait to assail you.",
    "But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,",
    "Just take off your coat and go to it;",
    "Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing",
    "That \u201ccannot be done,\u201d and you\u2019ll do it."

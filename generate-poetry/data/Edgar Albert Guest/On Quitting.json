    "How much grit do you think you\u2019ve got?",
    "Can you quit a thing that you like a lot?",
    "You may talk of pluck; it\u2019s an easy word,",
    "And where\u2019er you go it is often heard;",
    "But can you tell to a jot or guess",
    "Just how much courage you now possess?",
    "You may stand to trouble and keep your grin,",
    "But have you tackled self-discipline?",
    "Have you ever issued commands to you",
    "To quit the things that you like to do,",
    "And then, when tempted and sorely swayed,",
    "Those rigid orders have you obeyed?",
    "Don\u2019t boast of your grit till you\u2019ve tried it out,",
    "Nor prate to men of your courage stout,",
    "For it\u2019s easy enough to retain a grin",
    "In the face of a fight there\u2019s a chance to win,",
    "But the sort of grit that is good to own",
    "Is the stuff you need when you\u2019re all alone.",
    "How much grit do you think you\u2019ve got?",
    "Can you turn from joys that you like a lot?",
    "Have you ever tested yourself to know",
    "How far with yourself your will can go?",
    "If you want to know if you have grit,",
    "Just pick out a joy that you like, and quit.",
    "It\u2019s bully sport and it\u2019s open fight;",
    "It will keep you busy both day and night;",
    "For the toughest kind of a game you\u2019ll find",
    "Is to make your body obey your mind.",
    "And you never will know what is meant by grit",
    "Unless there\u2019s something you\u2019ve tried to quit."

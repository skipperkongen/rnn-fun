    "my mother a caregiver or just put her",
    "in a home, and I pull open the glass",
    "refrigerator door, am confronted",

    "of my realness by dumping their problems",
    "on me, and will I be too stupid to help them",

    "I take no chances, buy them both,",
    "sparkling smart, purified real, drain both bottles,",
    "look around to see is anyone watching?",
    "I\u2019m now brilliantly hydrated."

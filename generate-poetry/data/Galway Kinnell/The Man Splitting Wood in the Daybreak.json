    "The man splitting wood in the daybreak",
    "looks strong, as though, if one weakened,",
    "one could turn to him and he would help.",
    "Gus Newland was strong. When he split wood",
    "he struck hard, flashing the bright steel",
    "through the air so hard the hard maple",
    "leapt apart, as it\u2019s feared marriages will do",
    "in countries reluctant to permit divorce,",
    "and even willow, which, though stacked",
    "to dry a full year, on being split",
    "actually weeps\u2014totem wood, therefore,",
    "to the married-until-death\u2014sunders",
    "with many little lip-wetting gasp-noises.",
    "But Gus is dead. We could turn to our fathers,",
    "but they help us only by the unperplexed",
    "looking-back of the numerals cut into headstones.",
    "Or to our mothers, whose love, so devastated,",
    "can\u2019t, even in spring, break through the hard earth.",
    "Our spouses weaken at the same rate we do.",
    "We have to hold our children up to lean on them.",
    "Everyone who could help goes or hasn\u2019t arrived.",
    "What about the man splitting wood in the daybreak,",
    "who looked strong? That was years ago. That was me."

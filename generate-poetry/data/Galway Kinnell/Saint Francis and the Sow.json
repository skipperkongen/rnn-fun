    "The bud",
    "stands for all things,",
    "even for those things that don\u2019t flower,",
    "for everything flowers, from within, of self-blessing;",
    "though sometimes it is necessary",
    "to reteach a thing its loveliness,",
    "to put a hand on its brow",
    "of the flower",
    "and retell it in words and in touch",
    "it is lovely",
    "until it flowers again from within, of self-blessing;",
    "as Saint Francis",
    "put his hand on the creased forehead",
    "of the sow, and told her in words and in touch",
    "blessings of earth on the sow, and the sow",
    "began remembering all down her thick length,",
    "from the earthen snout all the way",
    "through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail,",
    "from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine",
    "down through the great broken heart",
    "to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering",
    "from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them:",
    "the long, perfect loveliness of sow."

    "All my stories are about being left,",
    "all yours about leaving. So we should have known.",
    "Should have known to leave well enough alone;",
    "we knew, and we didn\u2019t. You said let\u2019s put",
    "our cards on the table, your card",
    "was your body, the table my bed, where we didn\u2019t",
    "get till 4 am, so tired from wanting",
    "what we shouldn\u2019t that when we finally found our heads,",
    "we\u2019d lost our minds.",
    ",I wanted to call you",
    "so fast. But so slow you could taste each",

    "Dawn broke, or shattered. Once we\u2019ve made",
    "the promises, it\u2019s hard to add the prefix",

    "4th of July weekend when something that begins",
    "in mist, by mistake (whose?), means too much",
    "has to end. I think we need an abacus to get our love",
    "on course, and one of us to oil the shining rods",
    "so we can keep the crazy beads clicking,",
    "clicking. It wasn\u2019t a question",
    "of a perfect fit. Theoretically,",
    "it should be enough to say I left a man",
    "for a woman (90% of the world is content",
    "to leave it at that. Oh, lazy world) and when the woman",
    "lost her nerve, I left",

    "he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m in a phonebooth at the corner of Bank",
    "and Greenwich; not a booth, exactly,",
    "but two sheets of glass to shiver between.",
    "This is called being street-smart: dialing",
    "a number that you know won\u2019t be answered,",
    "but the message you leave leaves proof that you tried.",
    "And this, my two dearly beloveds, is this called",
    "hedging your bets? I fish out my other",
    "coin, turn it over in my fingers, press",
    "it into the slot. Hold it there. Let it drop."

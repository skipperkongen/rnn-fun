    "I want you with me, and yet you are the end",
    "of my privacy. Do you see how these rooms",
    "have become public? How we glance to see if\u2014",
    "who? Who did you imagine?",
    "Surely we\u2019re not here alone, you and I.",
    "I\u2019ve been wandering",
    "where the cold tracks of language",
    "collapse into cinders, unburnable trash.",
    "Beyond that, all I can see is the remote cold",
    "of meteors before their avalanches of farewell.",
    "If you asked me what words",
    "a voice like this one says in parting,",
    "I\u2019d say,",
    "toward which I feel neither hostility nor nostalgia.",
    "I\u2019m just a broom, sweeping."

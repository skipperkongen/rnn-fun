    "The first night at the monastery,",
    "a moth lit on my sleeve by firelight,",
    "long after the first frost.",
    "A short stick of incense burns",
    "thirty minutes, fresh thread of pine",
    "rising through the old pine of the hours.",
    "Summer is trapped under the thin",
    "glass on the brook, making",
    "the sound of an emptying bottle.",
    "Before the long silence,",
    "the monks make a long soft rustling,",
    "adjusting their robes.",
    "The deer are safe now. Their tracks",
    "are made of snow. The wind has dragged",
    "its branches over their history."

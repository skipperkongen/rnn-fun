    "Sometimes I long to be the woodpile,",
    "cut-apart trees soon to be smoke,",
    "or even the smoke itself,",

    "wherever I want to, at least for a while.",
    "Neither inside nor out,",
    "neither lost nor home, no longer",
    "a shape or a name, I\u2019d pass through",
    "all the broken windows of the world.",
    "It\u2019s not a wish for consciousness to end.",
    "It\u2019s not the appetite an army has",
    "for its own emptying heart,",
    "but a hunger to stand now and then",
    "alone on the death-grounds,",
    "where the dogs of the self are feeding."

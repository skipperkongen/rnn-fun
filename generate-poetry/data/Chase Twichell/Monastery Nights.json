  "text": [
    "I like to think about the monastery",
    "as I\u2019m falling asleep, so that it comes",
    "and goes in my mind like a screen saver.",
    "I conjure the lake of the zendo,",
    "rows of dark boats still unless",
    "someone coughs or otherwise",
    "ripples the calm.",
    "I can hear the four",
    "slipperiness",
    "of sleeping bags as people turn over",
    "in their bunks. The ancient bells.",
    "When I was first falling in love with Zen,",
    "I burned incense called",
    "\u201cKyoto Autumn Leaves,\u201d",
    "made by the Shoyeido Incense Company,",
    "Kyoto, Japan. To me it smelled like",
    "earnestness and ether, and I tried to imagine",
    "a consciousness ignorant of me.",
    "I just now lit a stick of it. I had to run downstairs",
    "for some rice to hold it upright in its bowl,",
    "which had been empty for a while,",
    "a raku bowl with two fingerprints",
    "in the clay. It calls up the monastery gate,",
    "the massive door demanding I recommit myself",
    "in the moments of both its opening",
    "and its closing, its weight now mine,",
    "I wanted to know what I was,",
    "and thought I could find the truth",
    "where the floor hurts the knee.",
    "I understand no one I consider to be religious.",
    "I have no idea what\u2019s meant when someone says",
    "they\u2019ve been intimate with a higher power.",
    "I seem to have been born without a god receptor.",
    "I have fervor but seem to lack",
    "even the basic instincts of the many seekers,",
    "mostly men, I knew in the monastery,",
    "sitting zazen all night,",
    "wearing their robes to near-rags",
    "boy-stitched back together with unmatched thread,",
    "smoothed over their laps and tucked under,",
    "unmoving in the long silence,",
    "the field of grain ripening, heavy tasseled,",
    "field of sentient beings turned toward candles,",
    "flowers, the Buddha gleaming",
    "like a vivid little sports car from his niche.",
    "What is the mind that precedes",
    "any sense we could possibly have",
    "of ourselves, the mind of self-ignorance?",
    "I thought that the divestiture of self",
    "could be likened to the divestiture",
    "of words, but I was wrong.",
    "It\u2019s not the same work.",
    "One\u2019s a transparency",
    "and one\u2019s an emptiness.",
    "Today I\u2019m painting what Mom",
    "calls no-colors, grays and browns,",
    "evergreens: what\u2019s left of the woods",
    "when autumn\u2019s come and gone.",
    "And though he died, Dad\u2019s here,",
    "still forgetting he\u2019s no longer",
    "married to Annie,",
    "that his own mother is dead,",
    "that he no longer owns a car.",
    "I told them not to make any trouble",
    "or I\u2019d send them both home.",
    "Surprise half inch of snow.",
    "What good are words?",
    "And what about birches in moonlight,",
    "Russell handing me the year\u2019s",
    "first chanterelle\u2014",
    "Shouldn\u2019t God feel like that?",
    "I aspire to \u201ca self-forgetful,",
    "perfectly useless concentration,\u201d",
    "as Elizabeth Bishop put it.",
    "So who shall I say I am?",
    "I\u2019m a prism, an expressive temporary",
    "sentience, a pinecone falling.",
    "I can hear my teacher saying,",
    "That misses it.",
    "Buddha goes on sitting through the century,",
    "leaving me alone in the front hall,",
    "which has just been cleaned and smells of pine."

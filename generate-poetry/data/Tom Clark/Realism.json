    "The smashed weirdness of the raving cadenzas of God",

    "We can take it from there.",
    "We can take it to Easy Street.",
    "But when things get tough on Easy Street",
    "What then? Is it time for realism?",
    "And who are these guys on the bus",
    "Who glide in golden hats past us",
    "On their way to Kansas City?"

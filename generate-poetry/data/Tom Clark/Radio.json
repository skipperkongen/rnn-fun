    "And while remaining motionless elsewise",
    "Force my eyeballs to come as close together as possible",
    "While uttering a horrible and foreign word",
    "Which I cannot repeat to you without now removing my larynx",

    "And in a deeper way",
    "You do",
    "Hours go by",
    "And I watch you",

    "As if of sepals were the tarp made",
    "As it is invisibly unrolled",
    "And sundown gasps its old Ray Charles 45 of",
    "Only through your voice"

    "As at the far edge of circling the country,",
    "facing suddenly the other ocean,",
    "the boundless edge of what I had wanted",
    "to know, I stepped",
    "into my answers\u2019 shadow ocean,",

    "of outdated old paperbacks,",

    "is like a skin",
    "that falls short of edge",
    "as a rug,",
    "that covers a no longer",
    "natural spot, no longer existent",
    "to live on from,",
    "the map of my person",
    "come to the end of,",
    "but not done.",
    "That country crossed was what I could imagine,",
    "and that little spit of answer is the shadow\u2014",
    "not the ocean which casts it\u2014",
    "that I step next",
    "into",
    "to be cleansed of question.",
    "But not of seeking",
    "\u2026it as",
    "if simplified for the seeking,",
    "come to its end at this body."

    "They gave the city a stroke. Its memories",
    "are cordoned off. They could collapse on you.",
    "Water leaks into bricks of the Workers\u2019 century",
    "and every meaning is blurred. No word in Roget",
    "now squares with another. If the word is Manchester",
    "it may be Australia, where that means sheets and towels.",
    "To give the city a stroke, they mixed a lorryload",
    "of henbane and meadowsweet oil and countrified her.",
    "Now Engels supports Max, and the British Union",
    "of beautiful ceramics is being shovelled up,",
    "blue-green tiles of the Corn Exchange,",
    "umber gloss bricks of the Royal Midlands Hotel.",
    "Unmelting ice everywhere, and loosened molecules.",
    "When the stroke came, every bottle winked at its neighbour."

    "Men around a submarine",

    "close to the end of wartime",

    "their oily, mesh-lit gangway",
    "of bunks atop machines.",
    "In from the country, we",
    "weren\u2019t to know our shillings",
    "bought them cigars and thread",
    "for what remained of Holland\u2019s Glory:",
    "uniforms, odd, rescued aircraft,",
    "and a clutch of undersea boats",
    "patrolling from Fremantle. The men\u2019s",
    "country was still captive, their great",
    "Indies had seen them ousted,",
    "their slaves from centuries back",
    "were still black, and their queen",
    "was in English exile.",
    "The only ripostes still open",
    "to them were torpedoes",
    "and their throaty half-",
    "American-sounding language.",
    "Speaking a luckier one",
    "we set off home then. Home",
    "and all that word would mean",
    "in the age of rebirthing nations",
    "which would be my time."

    "Harmonious Powers with Nature work",
    "On sky, earth, river, lake, and sea:",
    "Sunshine and storm, whirlwind and breeze",
    "All in one duteous task agree.",
    "Once did I see a slip of earth,",
    "By throbbing waves long undermined,",
    "Loosed from its hold; \u2014",
    "no one knew",
    "But all might see it float, obedient to the wind.",
    "Might see it, from the mossy shore",
    "Dissevered float upon the Lake,",
    "Float, with its crest of trees adorned",
    "On which the warbling birds their pastime take.",
    "Food, shelter, safety there they find",
    "There berries ripen, flowerets bloom;",
    "There insects live their lives \u2014 and die:",
    "A peopled",
    "it is; in size a tiny room.",
    "And thus through many seasons\u2019 space",
    "This little Island may survive",
    "But Nature, though we mark her not,",
    "Will take away \u2014 may cease to give.",
    "Perchance when you are wandering forth",
    "Upon some vacant sunny day",
    "Without an object, hope, or fear,",
    "Thither your eyes may turn \u2014 the Isle is passed away.",
    "Buried beneath the glittering Lake!",
    "Its place no longer to be found,",
    "Yet the lost fragments shall remain,",
    "To fertilize some other ground."

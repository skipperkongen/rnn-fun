    "Out of a high meadow where flowers",
    "bloom above cloud, come down;",
    "pursue me with reasons for smiling without malice.",
    "Bring mimic pride like that of the seedling fir,",
    "surprise in the perfect leg-stems",
    "and queries unstirred by recognition or fear",
    "pooled in the deep eyes.",
    "Come down by regions where rocks",
    "lift through the hot haze of pain;",
    "down landscapes darkened, crossed",
    "by the rift of death-shock; place print",
    "of a neat hoof on trampled ground",
    "where not one leaf or root",
    "remains unbitten; but come down",
    "always, accompany me to the morass",
    "of the decaying mind. There",
    "we\u2019ll share one rotted stump between us."

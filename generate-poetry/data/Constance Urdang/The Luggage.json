    "Travel is a vanishing act",
    "Only to those who are left behind.",
    "What the traveler knows",
    "Is that he accompanies himself,",
    "Unwieldy baggage that can\u2019t be checked,",
    "Stolen, or lost, or mistaken.",
    "So one took, past outposts of empire,",
    "\u201cCalmly as if in the British Museum,\u201d",
    "Not only her Victorian skirts,",
    "Starched shirtwaists, and umbrella, but her faith",
    "In the civilizing mission of women,",
    "Her backaches and insomnia, her innocent valor;",
    "Another, friend of witch-doctors,",
    "Living on native chop,",
    "Trading tobacco and hooks for fish and fetishes,",
    "Heralded her astonishing arrival",
    "Under shivering stars",
    "By calling, \u201cIt\u2019s only me!\u201d A third,",
    "Intent on savage customs, and to demonstrate",
    "That a woman could travel as easily as a man,",
    "Carried a handkerchief damp with wifely tears",
    "And only once permitted a tribal chieftain",
    "To stroke her long, golden hair."

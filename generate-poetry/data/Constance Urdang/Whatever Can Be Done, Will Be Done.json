    "The boy who is kind to animals",
    "has tied a firecracker to the cat\u2019s tail",
    "he is stoning the spotted bitch he",
    "is called Wind-Chaser",
    "Yesterday he",
    "gave bread and broken meat",
    "to the street dogs, his friends",
    "His friends are catching lizards behind the wall",
    "they killed a songbird with their catapults",
    "with the boy who is kind to animals",
    "they set fire to a grasshopper, laughing",
    "Along the road",
    "the children are shaking boxes",
    "something wants to get out",
    "The mother spits curses",
    "she says we should pay because they are hungry",

    "run away from their baffled eyes"

    "You came into this world trailing clouds all right,",
    "they just happened to be big black ones.",
    "In the castle you drank from a poisoned goblet",
    "and were changed into something even bears cringe at.",
    "When you awake baling-wired in thorns,",
    "viceroys around you cobwebbed to their steins,",
    "moth-eaten ermines, a muttering king\u2014",
    "what choice do you have?",
    "Rappel down the turret with your cap and bells.",
    "Handed a baton in a bad-luck relay,",
    "you've overshot the cliff and are pinwheeling down,",
    "flailing in time to that whistling-wind keening",
    "that lets viewers know you will soon be compressed",
    "under a subsequent sequence of rocks.",
    "Squashed into pleats a centimeter wide?",
    "Stride till you're 3-D again.",
    "You're staggering through a dark wood,",
    "soundtrack a fugue.",
    "Remember wrens risk a hand for a single seed,",
    "orchids can sprout from duff alone.",
    "How many can you feed from your sourdough lumps?",
    "Each morning, braid a loaf. Give them away."

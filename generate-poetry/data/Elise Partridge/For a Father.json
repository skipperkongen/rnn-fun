    "Remember after work you grabbed our skateboard,",
    "crouched like a surfer, wingtips over the edge;",
    "wheels clacketing down the pocked macadam,",
    "you veered almost straight into the neighbor's hedge?",
    "We ran after you laughing, shouting, Wait!",
    "Or that August night you swept us to the fair?",
    "The tallest person boarding the Ferris wheel,",
    "you rocked our car right when we hit the apex",
    "above the winking midway, to make us squeal.",
    "Next we raced you to the games, shouting, Wait!",
    "At your funeral, relatives and neighbors,",
    "shaking our hands, said, \"So young to have died!\"",
    "But we've dreamt you're just skating streets away,",
    "striding the fairgrounds toward a wilder ride.",
    "And we're still straggling behind, shouting,",

    "Thanksgiving Day I like to see",
    "Our cook perform her witchery.",
    "She turns a pumpkin into pie",
    "As easily as you or I",
    "Can wave a hand or wink an eye.",
    "She takes leftover bread and muffin",
    "And changes them to turkey stuffin\u2019.",
    "She changes cranberries to sauce",
    "And meats to stews and stews to broths;",
    "And when she mixes gingerbread",
    "It turns into a man instead",
    "With frosting collar \u2019round his throat",
    "And raisin buttons down his coat.",
    "Oh, some like magic made by wands,",
    "And some read magic out of books,",
    "And some like fairy spells and charms",
    "But I like magic made by cooks!"

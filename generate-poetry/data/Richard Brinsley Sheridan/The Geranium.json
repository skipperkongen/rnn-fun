    "In the close covert of a grove",
    "By nature formed for scenes of love,",
    "Said Susan in a lucky hour:",
    "\u2018Observe yon sweet geranium flower.",
    "How straight upon its stalk it stands,",
    "And tempts our violating hands,",
    "Whilst the soft bud, as yet unspread,",
    "Hangs down its pale declining head.",
    "Yet soon as it is ripe to blow,",
    "The stems shall rise, the head shall glow.\u2019",
    "\u2018Nature,\u2019 said I, \u2018my lovely Sue,",
    "To all her followers lends a clue.",
    "Her simple laws themselves explain",
    "As links of one continued chain;",
    "For her the mysteries of creation",
    "Are but the works of generation.",
    "Yon blushing, strong, triumphant flower",
    "Is in the crisis of its power:",
    "But short, alas, its vigorous reign;",
    "He sheds his seed, and drops again.",
    "The bud that hangs in pale decay",
    "Feels not, as yet, the plastic ray.",
    "Tomorrow\u2019s sun shall bid him rise,",
    "Then, too, he sheds his seed, and dies.",
    "But words, my love, are vain and weak;",
    "For proof, let bright example speak.\u2019",
    "Then straight before the wondering maid",
    "The tree of life I gently laid.",
    "\u2018Observe, sweet Sue, his drooping head,",
    "How pale, how languid, and how dead.",
    "Yet let the sun of thy bright eyes",
    "Shine but a moment, it shall rise.",
    "Let but the dew of thy soft hand",
    "Refresh the stem, it straight shall stand.",
    "Already, see, it swells, it grows,",
    "Its head is redder than the rose,",
    "Its shriveled fruit, of dusky hue,",
    "Now glows\u2014a present fit for Sue.",
    "The balm of life each artery fills,",
    "And in o\u2019erflowing drops distils.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, me!\u2019 cried Susan, \u2018When is this?",
    "What strange tumultuous throbs of bliss!",
    "Sure, never mortal till this hour",
    "Felt such emotion at a flower!",
    "Oh, serpent, cunning to deceive,",
    "Sure \u2019tis this tree that tempted Eve.",
    "The crimson apples hang so fair",
    "Alas! what woman could forbear?\u2019",
    "\u2018Well hast thou guessed, my love,\u2019 I cried,",
    "\u2018It is the tree by which she died \u2013",
    "The tree which could alone content her.",
    "All nature, Susan, seeks the centre.",
    "Yet let us still poor Eve forgive,",
    "It\u2019s the tree by which we live.",
    "For lovely women still it grows,",
    "And in the centre only blows.",
    "But chief for thee it spreads its charms,",
    "For paradise is in thy arms \u2026\u2019",
    "I ceased, for nature kindly here",
    "Began to whisper in her ear,",
    "And lovely Sue lay softly panting",
    "While the geranium tree was planting,",
    "\u2019Til in the heat of amorous strife",
    "She burst the mellow tree of life.",
    "\u2018Oh, heaven!\u2019 cried Susan with a sigh,",
    "\u2018The hour we taste \u2013 we surely die.",
    "Strange raptures seize my fainting frame,",
    "And all my body glows with flame.",
    "Yet let me snatch one parting kiss",
    "To tell my love I die with bliss \u2013",
    "That pleased thy Susan yields her breath;",
    "Oh, who would live, if this be death?\u2019"

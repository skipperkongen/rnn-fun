    "The secretive hart turns at bay,",
    "lowers his tines to the hounds\u2019 cry.",
    "The sword enters the bull\u2019s heart\u2014",
    "still he stands,",
    "amazed on the red sand",
    "as the stony unbeliever might,",
    "who has seen God. Soon now",
    "horns will sound",
    "for the unmaking. Beaters flush",
    "the grey heron",
    "like a coney from its warren,",
    "the peregrine\u2019s jet eyes flash.",
    "They go ringing up the air,",
    "each in its separate spiral stair",
    "to the indigo rim of the skies,",
    "then descend",
    "swift as a murderer\u2019s hand",
    "with a knife. Death\u2019s gesture liquefies",
    "in bringing the priestly heron down.",
    "Her prize, the marrow from a wing-bone",
    "in which she delights, her spurred",
    "fleur-de-lys tongue",
    "stained",
    "little angel in her hangman\u2019s hood."

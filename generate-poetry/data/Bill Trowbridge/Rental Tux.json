    "It chafed like some new skin we\u2019d grown,",
    "or feathers, the cummerbund and starched collar",
    "pinching us to show how real this transformation",
    "into princes was, how powerful we\u2019d grown",
    "by getting drivers\u2019 licenses, how tall and total",
    "our new perspective, above that rusty keyhole",
    "parents squinted through. We\u2019d found the key:",
    "that nothing really counts except a romance",
    "bright as Technicolor, wide as Cinerama,",
    "and this could be the night. No lie."

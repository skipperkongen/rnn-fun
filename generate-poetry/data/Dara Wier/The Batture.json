    "The batture\u2019s water and sand disappear",
    "when water swells the river,",
    "heat\u2019s portion of a northern winter.",
    "Under willows cropped up",
    "since our last cow is dead",
    "and carried to the batture",
    "to be taken by the water",
    "clean into another season,",
    "we sit on green granite",
    "piled deep enough to keep",
    "the batture dry one more week.",
    "We don\u2019t say so but we wait",
    "for the swollen body",
    "to appear before us, we want",
    "the torn leg to distract us,",
    "the loose arm to show us where.",
    "We\u2019ve always known which way",
    "the water runs, the differences",
    "among earth, air, water",
    "and whatever the horizon offers",
    "that is not actually there.",
    "We want to be the ones",
    "to identify the missing person.",
    "We count the reward we\u2019d earn.",
    "There is a family",
    "in southern Minnesota",
    "keeping a closet of dry-cleaned",
    "suits, a mahogany high-boy",
    "of ironed shirts, folded",
    "undershorts and sweaters.",
    "In the ashtray that says",
    "are the coins he left",
    "without thinking,",
    "the only clue which tells his family",
    "what they didn\u2019t want to know,",
    "he might have known",
    "what he was doing.",
    "We want to be the ones whose call",
    "is first in a series of related events",
    "which will end we hope in the family\u2019s",
    "satisfaction with the coroner\u2019s",
    "identification, and though it is old-fashioned",
    "and no longer done in this country,",
    "we\u2019d like to think the pennies",
    "from his pocket will be mailed",
    "to the morgue, polished to",
    "their copper finish, pressed",
    "to float forever on his eyelids and make us",
    "take a second look as the light",
    "hits them and they beautifully glitter.",
    "We think how glad we were",
    "when we first saw him he floated",
    "face down in the water",
    "which a few moments earlier had been snow",
    "his children sledded and slipped on.",
    "Light beats gravity, lifts",
    "these young trees from the water.",
    "This is where we watch time,",
    "mark the spot across the water",
    "which is the red flag",
    "we hope calls us",
    ".",
    "This is twenty-eight states."

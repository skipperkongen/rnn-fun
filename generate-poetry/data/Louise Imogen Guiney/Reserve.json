    "You that are dear, O you above the rest!",
    "Forgive him his evasive moods and cold;",
    "The absence that belied him oft of old,",
    "The war upon sad speech, the desperate jest,",
    "And pity\u2019s wildest gush but half-confessed,",
    "Forgive him! Let your gentle memories hold",
    "Some written word once tender and once bold,",
    "Or service done shamefacedly at best,",
    "Whereby to judge him. All his days he spent,",
    "Like one who with an angel wrestled well,",
    "O\u2019ermastering Love with show of light disdain;",
    "And whatso\u2019er your spirits underwent,",
    "He, wounded for you, worked no miracle",
    "To make his heart\u2019s allegiance wholly plain."

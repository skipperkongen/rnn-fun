    "When on the marge of evening the last blue light is broken,",
    "And winds of dreamy odour are loosened from afar,",
    "Or when my lattice opens, before the lark hath spoken,",
    "On dim laburnum-blossoms, and morning\u2019s dying star,",
    "I think of thee (O mine the more if other eyes be sleeping!),",
    "Whose greater noonday splendours the many share and see,",
    "While sacred and for ever, some perfect law is keeping",
    "The late, the early twilight, alone and sweet for me."

    "A stupor on the heath,",
    "And wrath along the sky;",
    "Space everywhere; beneath",
    "A flat and treeless wold for us, and darkest noon on high.",
    "Sullen quiet below,",
    "But storm in upper air!",
    "A wind from long ago,",
    "In mouldy chambers of the cloud had ripped an arras there,",
    "And singed the triple gloom,",
    "And let through, in a flame,",
    "Crowned faces of old Rome:",
    "Regnant o\u2019er Rome\u2019s abandoned ground, processional they came.",
    "Uprisen as any sun",
    "Through vistas hollow grey,",
    "Aloft, and one by one,",
    "In brazen casques the Emperors loomed large, and sank away.",
    "In ovals of wan light",
    "Each warrior eye and mouth;",
    "A pageant brutal bright",
    "As if once over loudly passed Jove\u2019s laughter in the south;",
    "And dimmer, these among,",
    "Some cameo\u2019d head aloof,",
    "With ringlets heavy-hung,",
    "Like yellow stonecrop comely grown around a castle roof.",
    "An instant: gusts again,",
    "Then heaven\u2019s impacted wall,",
    "The hot insistent rain,",
    "The thunder-shock; and of the Past mirage no more at all,",
    "No more the alien dream",
    "Pursuing, as we went,",
    "With glory\u2019s curs\u00e8d gleam:",
    "Nor sin of C\u00e6sar\u2019s ruined line engulfed us, innocent.",
    "The vision great and dread",
    "Corroded; sole in view",
    "Was empty Egdon spread,",
    "Her crimson summer weeds ashake in tempest: but we knew",
    "What Tacitus had borne",
    "In that wrecked world we saw;",
    "And what, thine heart uptorn,",
    "My Juvenal! distraught with love of violated Law."

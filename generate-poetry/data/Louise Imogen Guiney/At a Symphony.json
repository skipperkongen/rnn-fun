    "Oh, I would have these tongues oracular",
    "Dip into silence, tease no more, let be!",

    "Gusty and sweet against a prison-bar.",
    "To earth the boast that her gold empires are,",
    "The menace of delicious death to me,",
    "Great Undesign, strong as by God\u2019s decree,",
    "Piercing the heart with beauty from afar!",
    "Music too winning to the sense forlorn!",
    "Of what angelic lineage was she born,",
    "Bred in what rapture?\u2014These her sires and friends:",
    "Censure, Denial, Gloom, and Hunger\u2019s throe.",
    "Praised be the Spirit that thro\u2019 thee, Schubert! so",
    "Wrests evil unto wholly heavenly ends."

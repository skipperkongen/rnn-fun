    "A woof reversed the fatal shuttles weave,",
    "How slow! but never once they slip the thread.",
    "Hither, upon the Georgian idler\u2019s tread,",
    "Up spacious ways the lindens interleave,",
    "Clouding the royal air since yester-eve,",
    "Come men bereft of time and scant of bread,",
    "Loud, who were dumb, immortal, who were dead,",
    "Thro\u2019 the cowed world their kingdom to retrieve.",
    "What ails thee, England? Altar, mart, and grange",
    "Dream of the knife by night; not so, not so",
    "The clear Republic waits the general throe,",
    "Along her noonday mountains\u2019 open range.",
    "God be with both! for one is young to know",
    "The other\u2019s rote of evil and of change."

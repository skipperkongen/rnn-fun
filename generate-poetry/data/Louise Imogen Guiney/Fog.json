    "Like bodiless water passing in a sigh,",
    "Thro\u2019 palsied streets the fatal shadows flow,",
    "And in their sharp disastrous undertow",
    "Suck in the morning sun, and all the sky.",
    "The towery vista sinks upon the eye,",
    "As if it heard the Hebrew bugles blow,",
    "Black and dissolved; nor could the founders know",
    "How what was built so bright should daily die.",
    "Thy mood with man\u2019s is broken and blent in,",
    "City of Stains! And ache of thought doth drown",
    "The primitive light in which thy life began;",
    "Great as thy dole is, smirch\u00e8d with his sin,",
    "Greater and elder yet the love of man",
    "Full in thy look, tho\u2019 the dark visor\u2019s down."

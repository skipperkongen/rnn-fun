    "I learned from my mother how to love",
    "the living, to have plenty of vases on hand",
    "in case you have to rush to the hospital",
    "with peonies cut from the lawn, black ants",
    "still stuck to the buds. I learned to save jars",
    "large enough to hold fruit salad for a whole",
    "grieving household, to cube home-canned pears",
    "and peaches, to slice through maroon grape skins",
    "and flick out the sexual seeds with a knife point.",
    "I learned to attend viewings even if I didn\u2019t know",
    "the deceased, to press the moist hands",
    "of the living, to look in their eyes and offer",
    "sympathy, as though I understood loss even then.",
    "I learned that whatever we say means nothing,",
    "what anyone will remember is that we came.",
    "I learned to believe I had the power to ease",
    "awful pains materially like an angel.",
    "Like a doctor, I learned to create",
    "from another\u2019s suffering my own usefulness, and once",
    "you know how to do this, you can never refuse.",
    "To every house you enter, you must offer",
    "healing: a chocolate cake you baked yourself,",
    "the blessing of your voice, your chaste touch."

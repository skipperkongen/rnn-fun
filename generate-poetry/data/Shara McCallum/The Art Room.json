    "Because we did not have threads",
    "of turquoise, silver, and gold,",
    "we could not sew a sun nor sky.",
    "And our hands became balls of fire.",
    "And our arms spread open like wings.",
    "Because we had no chalk or pastels,",
    "no toad, forest, or morning-grass slats",
    "of paper, we had no colour",
    "for creatures. So we squatted",
    "and sprang, squatted and sprang.",
    "Four young girls, plaits heavy",
    "on our backs, our feet were beating",
    "drums, drawing rhythms from the floor;",
    "our mouths became woodwinds;",
    "our tongues touched teeth and were reeds."

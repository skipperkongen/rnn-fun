    "In Golden Gate Park that day",
    "a man and his wife were coming along",
    "thru the enormous meadow",
    "which was the meadow of the world",
    "He was wearing green suspenders",
    "and carrying an old beat-up flute",
    "in one hand",
    "while his wife had a bunch of grapes",
    "which she kept handing out",
    "individually",
    "to various squirrels",
    "as if each",
    "were a little joke",
    "And then the two of them came on",
    "thru the enormous meadow",
    "which was the meadow of the world",
    "and then",
    "at a very still spot where the trees dreamed",
    "and seemed to have been waiting thru all time",
    "for them",
    "they sat down together on the grass",
    "without looking at each other",
    "and ate oranges",
    "without looking at each other",
    "and put the peels",
    "in a basket which they seemed",
    "to have brought for that purpose",
    "without looking at each other",
    "And then",
    "he took his shirt and undershirt off",
    "but kept his hat on",
    "sideways",
    "and without saying anything",
    "fell asleep under it",
    "And his wife just sat there looking",
    "at the birds which flew about",
    "calling to each other",
    "in the stilly air",
    "as if they were questioning existence",
    "or trying to recall something forgotten",
    "But then finally",
    "she too lay down flat",
    "and just lay there looking up",
    "at nothing",
    "yet fingering the old flute",
    "which nobody played",
    "and finally looking over",
    "at him",
    "without any particular expression",
    "except a certain awful look",
    "of terrible depression"

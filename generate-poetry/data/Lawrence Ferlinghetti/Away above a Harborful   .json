    "Away above a harborful",
    "of caulkless houses",
    "among the charley noble chimneypots",
    "of a rooftop rigged with clotheslines",
    "a woman pastes up sails",
    "upon the wind",
    "hanging out her morning sheets",
    "with wooden pins",
    "O lovely mammal",
    "her nearly naked breasts",
    "throw taut shadows",
    "when she stretches up",
    "to hang at last the last of her",
    "so white washed sins",
    "but it is wetly amorous",
    "and winds itself about her",
    "clinging to her skin",
    "So caught with arms",
    "upraised",
    "she tosses back her head",
    "in voiceless laughter",
    "and in choiceless gesture then",
    "shakes out gold hair",
    "while in the reachless seascape spaces",
    "between the blown white shrouds",
    "stand out the bright steamers",
    "to kingdom come"

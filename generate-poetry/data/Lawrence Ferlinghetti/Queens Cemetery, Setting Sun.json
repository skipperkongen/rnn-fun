    "Airport bus from JFK",
    "cruising through Queens",

    "tilted toward the sun forever",
    "While on the far horizon",
    "Mannahatta\u2019s great stone slabs",
    "skyscraper tombs and parapets",
    "casting their own long black shadows",
    "over all these long-haired graves",

    "Catholic sisters of charity",
    "parish priests and Irish cops",
    "Viennese doctors of delirium",
    "now all abandoned in eternity",
    "parcels in a dead-letter office",
    "inscrutable addresses on them",
    "beyond further deliverance",
    "in an America wheeling past them",
    "and disappearing oblivious",
    "into East River\u2019s echoing tunnels",
    "down the great American drain"

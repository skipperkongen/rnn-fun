    "The dove-white gulls",
    "on the wet lawn in Washington Square",
    "in the early morning fog",
    "each a little ghost in the gloaming",
    "Souls transmigrated maybe",
    "from Hudson\u2019s shrouded shores",
    "across all the silent years\u2014",
    "Which one\u2019s my maybe mafioso father",
    "in his so white suit and black shoes",
    "in his real estate office Forty-second Street",
    "or at the front table wherever he went\u2014",
    "Which my dear lost mother with faded smile",
    "locked away from me in time\u2014",
    "Which my big brother Charley",
    "selling switching-signals all his life",
    "on the New York Central\u2014",
    "And which good guy brother Clem",
    "sweating in Sing Sing\u2019s darkest offices",
    "deputy-warden thirty years",
    "watching executions in the wooden armchair",
    "(with leather straps and black hood)",
    "He too gone mad with it in the end\u2014",
    "And which my nearest brother Harry",
    "still kindest and dearest in a far suburb\u2014",
    "I see them now all turn to me at last",
    "gull-eyed in the white dawn",
    "about to call to me",
    "across the silent grass"

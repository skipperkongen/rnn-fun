    "You\u2019re speeding me down the Ventura freeway",
    "in your battered Scout, patched since your angry",
    "crash into the drunken pole that swerved into your road.",
    "We\u2019ve got no seat belts, no top, bald tires,",
    "so I clutch any metal that seems as though it might",
    "be firm, belie its rusted rattling. Under my",
    "August burn I\u2019m fainting white, but I\u2019m trying",
    "to give you what you want: an easy mother.",
    "For the last two days you\u2019ve been plugged",
    "into your guitar, earphones on, door closed. I spoiled",
    "our holiday with warnings about your accidental",
    "life, said this time I wouldn\u2019t rescue you, knowing",
    "you\u2019d hate me, knowing I\u2019d make myself sick. We\u2019re",
    "speaking now, the airport is so near, New York closer",
    "than my birthday tomorrow, close as bearded death",
    "whose Porsche just cut us off in the fast lane.",
    "When you were three, you asked if God lived",
    "under the street. I said I didn\u2019t know, although",
    "a world opened under my feet walking with you",
    "over strange angels, busy arranging our fate. Soon,",
    "if we make it, I\u2019ll be in the air, where people say God lives,",
    "the line between you and me stretched thinner,",
    "thinner but tight enough still to bind us,",
    "choke us both with love. Your Scout, putty-colored",
    "as L.A. mornings, protests loudly but hangs on."

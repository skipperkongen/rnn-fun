    "\u2018Talbingo River\u2019\u2014as one says of bones:",
    "\u2018Captain\u2019 or \u2018Commodore\u2019 that smelt gunpowder",
    "In old engagements no one quite believes",
    "Or understands. Talbingo had its blood",
    "As they did, ran with waters huge and clear",
    "Lopping down mountains,",
    "Turning crags to banks.",
    "Now it\u2019s a sort of aching valley,",
    "Basalt shaggy with scales,",
    "A funnel of tobacco-coloured clay,",
    "Smoulders of puffed earth",
    "And pebbles and shell-bodied flies",
    "And water thickening to stone in pocks.",
    "That\u2019s what we\u2019re like out here,",
    "Beds of dried-up passions."

    "Ranks of electroplated cubes, dwindling to glitters,",
    "Like the other pasture, the trigonometry of marble,",
    "Death\u2019s candy-bed. Stone caked on stone,",
    "Dry pyramids and racks of iron balls.",
    "Life is observed, a precipitate of pellets,",
    "Or grammarians freeze it into spar,",
    "Their rhomboids, as for instance, the finest crystal",
    "Fixing a snowfall under glass. Gods are laid out",
    "In alabaster, with horny cartilage",
    "And zinc ribs; or systems of ecstasy",
    "Baked into bricks. There is a gallery of sculpture,",
    "Bleached bones of heroes, Gorgon masks of bushrangers;",
    "But the quarries are of more use than this,",
    "Filled with the rolling of huge granite dice,",
    "Ideas and judgments: vivisection, the Baptist Church,",
    "Good men and bad men, polygamy, birth-control . . .",
    "Frail tinkling rush",
    "Water-hair streaming",
    "Prickles and glitters",
    "Cloudy with bristles",
    "River of thought",
    "Swimming the pebbles\u2014",
    "Undo, loosen your bubbles!"

    "At last I know\u2014it\u2019s on old ivory jars,",
    "Glassed with old miniatures and garnered once with musk.",
    "I\u2019ve seen those eyes like smouldering April stars",
    "As carp might see them behind their bubbled skies",
    "In pale green fishponds\u2014they\u2019re as green your eyes,",
    "As lakes themselves, changed to green stone at dusk.",
    "At last I know\u2014it\u2019s paned in a crystal hoop",
    "On powder-boxes from some dead Italian girl,",
    "I\u2019ve seen such eyes grow suddenly dark, and droop",
    "Their small, pure lids, as if I\u2019d pried too far",
    "In finding you snared there on that ivory jar",
    "By crusted motes of rose and smoky-pearl."

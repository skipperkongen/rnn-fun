    "Coming out of India with ten thousand a year",
    "Exchanged for flesh and temper, a dry Faust",
    "Whose devil barters with digestion, has he paid dear",
    "For dipping his fingers in the Roc\u2019s valley?",
    "Who knows? It\u2019s certain that he owns a rage,",
    "A face like shark-skin, full of Yellow Jack,",
    "And that unreckoning tyranny of age",
    "That calls for turtles\u2019 eggs in Twickenham.",
    "Sometimes, by moonlight, in a barge he\u2019ll float",
    "Whilst hirelings blow their skulking flageolets,",
    "Served by a Rajah in a golden coat",
    "With pigeon-pie . . . Madeira . . . and Madeira . . .",
    "Or in his Bon de Paris with silver frogs",
    "He rolls puff-bellied in an equipage,",
    "Elegant chariot, through a gulf of fogs",
    "To dine on dolphin-steak with Post-Captains.",
    "Who knows? There are worse things than steak, perhaps,",
    "Worse things than oyster-sauces and tureens",
    "And worlds of provender like painted maps",
    "Pricked out with ports of claret and pitchcocked eels,",
    "And hubbubs of billiard-matches, burnt champagne,",
    "Beautiful ladies \u2018of the establishment\u2019",
    "Always in tempers, or melting out again,",
    "Bailiffs and Burgundy and writs of judgment\u2014",
    "Thus to inhabit huge, lugubrious halls",
    "Damp with the steam of entrees, glazed with smoke,",
    "Raw drinking, greasy eating, bussing and brawls,",
    "Drinking and eating and bursting into bed-chambers.",
    "But, in the end, one says farewell to them;",
    "And if he\u2019d curse to-day\u2014God damn your blood!\u2014",
    "Even his curses I\u2019d not altogether condemn,",
    "Not altogether scorn; and if phantoms ate\u2014",
    "Hickey, I\u2019d say, sit down, pull up, set to:",
    "Here\u2019s knife and fork, there\u2019s wine, and there\u2019s a barmaid.",
    "Let us submerge ourselves in onion-soup,",
    "Anything but this \u2018damned profession of writing.\u2019"

    "Under the soft translucent linen,",
    "the ridges around your nipples",
    "harden at the thought of my tongue.",
    "You \u2014 lying inverted like the letter \u2018c\u2019 \u2014",
    "arch yourself deliberately",
    "wanting the warm press of my lips,",
    "it\u2019s wet to coat the skin",
    "that is bristling, burning,",
    "breaking into sweats of desire \u2014",
    "sweet juices of imagination.",
    "But in fact, I haven\u2019t even touched",
    "you. At least, not yet."

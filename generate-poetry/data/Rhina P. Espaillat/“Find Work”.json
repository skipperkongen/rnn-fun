    "My mother\u2019s mother, widowed very young",
    "of her first love, and of that love\u2019s first fruit,",
    "moved through her father\u2019s farm, her country tongue",
    "and country heart anaesthetized and mute",
    "with labor. So her kind was taught to do\u2014",
    "\u201cFind work,\u201d she would reply to every grief\u2014",
    "and her one dictum, whether false or true,",
    "tolled heavy with her passionate belief.",
    "Widowed again, with children, in her prime,",
    "she spoke so little it was hard to bear",
    "so much composure, such a truce with time",
    "spent in the lifelong practice of despair.",
    "But I recall her floors, scrubbed white as bone,",
    "her dishes, and how painfully they shone."

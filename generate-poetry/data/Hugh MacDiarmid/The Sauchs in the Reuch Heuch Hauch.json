    "There\u2019s teuch sauchs growin\u2019 i\u2019 the Reuch Heuch Hauch.",

    "And ilk ane yoked in a whirligig",

    "O we come doon frae oor stormiest moods,",
    "And Licht like a bird i\u2019 the haun\u2019,",
    "But the teuch sauchs there i\u2019 the Reuch Heuch Hauch",
    "As the deil\u2019s ain hert are thrawn.",
    "The winds \u2019ud pu\u2019 them up by the roots,",
    "Tho\u2019 it broke the warl\u2019 asunder,",
    "But they rin richt doon thro\u2019 the boddom o\u2019 Hell,",
    "And nane kens hoo fer under!",
    "There\u2019s no\u2019 a licht that the Heavens let loose",
    "Can calm them a hanlawhile,",
    "Nor frae their ancient amplefeyst",
    "Sall God\u2019s ain sel\u2019 them wile."

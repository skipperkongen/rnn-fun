    "The futilely died over, properly scholarly attitude.",

    "I really am sometimes tempted to say",
    "That it\u2019s merely a glittering platitude;",
    "That people have just fallen into the way,",
    "When lacking a subject, to tell of the sway",
    "Of the properly scholarly attitude\u2014",
    "The easily preachable, spread-eagle speechable,",
    "In practice unreachable, properly scholarly attitude."

    "In the cold I will rise, I will bathe",
    "In waters of ice; myself",
    "Will shiver, and shrive myself,",
    "Alone in the dawn, and anoint",
    "Forehead and feet and hands;",
    "I will shutter the windows from light,",
    "I will place in their sockets the four",
    "Tall candles and set them a-flame",
    "In the grey of the dawn; and myself",
    "Will lay myself straight in my bed,",
    "And draw the sheet under my chin."

    "When the wind was right everything else",
    "was wrong, like the oak we thought built",
    "better than the house split like a ship",
    "on a rock. We let it stand the winter,",
    "spectral, shagged, every sky its snow,",
    "then cut it down, dismantled it in",
    "pieces like disease. Then limbs from",
    "the yellow poplar broke at will\u2014",
    "fell from the heights like bones",
    "of the Puritans; even to gather them",
    "in bundles seemed puritanical.",
    "And the willow, by its nature, wept",
    "long tears of its overbranching,",
    "so pale they were autumnal. These",
    "we turned too easily to switches,",
    "mocking the bickering in the spruce's",
    "nesting eaves, which crows, then jays",
    "bothered all they could. The list,",
    "the list. The sycamore made maps",
    "of disappearance; the copper beech,",
    "parental in its girth, was clipped",
    "hard, by a car, with a wound that wouldn't",
    "heal. Doctoring, then witchery, then",
    "love\u2014nothing we tried would work.",
    "More apple trees that grew nowhere",
    "but down. More maples spilling sugar.",
    "More hawthorns blazing out, telling truth."

    "Mother, I have been devastated all my life. I never said anything.",
    "That\u2019s why I wear a parachute. Why I tiptoed from my bedroom",
    "to yours, and lay my head on the beige carpet for fear of worse.",
    "Were there sirens? There were. Were there familiar songs? Yes.",
    "I am afraid of the beds I have been in. In the morning there was",
    "the heel of your boot sharper than before. Mother, what do I do",
    "with your mail? Do you want to keep this snake in the basement?",
    "What about the kitten? Do you want all these photographs of other",
    "people\u2019s children? The temperature in the lizard\u2019s cage is dropping.",
    "Let\u2019s be realistic. If I open the windows the birds will come in and",
    "eat out the eyes. Mother, I am bereft. Mother, I wear your necklace",
    "and nothing else. Mother, I never. Nevermind. Let\u2019s be fatalistic.",
    "The neighbors know I\u2019m down here. I can hear them watching.",
    "Mother, after they take your eyes I will sew the lids myself."

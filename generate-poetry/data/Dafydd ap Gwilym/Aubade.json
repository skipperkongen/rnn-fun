    "It seemed as if we did not sleep",
    "One wink that night; I was sighing deep.",
    "The cruellest judge in the costliest court",
    "Could not condemn a night so short.",
    "We had the light out, but I know,",
    "Each time I turned, a radiant glow",
    "Suffused the room, and shining snow",
    "Alit from Heaven\u2019s candle-fires",
    "Illuminated our desires.",
    "But the last time I held her, strong,",
    "Excited, closest, very long,",
    "Something started to go wrong.",
    "The edge of dawn\u2019s despotic veil",
    "Showed at the eastern window-pale",
    "And there it was,\u2014the morning light!",
    "Gwen was seized with a fearful fright,",
    "Became an apparition, cried,",
    "\u201cGet up, go now with God, go hide!",
    "\u201cLove is a salt, a gall, a rue,",
    "A vinegar-vintage.",
    "Vaya con Dios, quickly, too!\u201d",
    "\u201cAh, not yet, never yet, my love;",
    "The stars and moon still shine above.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen why do the raucous ravens talk",
    "With such a loud insistent squawk?\u201d",
    "\u201cCrows always cry like that, when fleas",
    "Nibble their ankles, nip their knees.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd why do the dogs yip, yammer, yell?\u201d",
    "\u201cThey think they\u2019ve caught a fox\u2019s smell.\u201d",
    "\u201cPoet, the wisdom of a fool",
    "Offers poor counsel as a rule.",
    "Open the door, open it wide",
    "As fast as you can, and leap outside.",
    "The dogs are fierce when they get untied.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe woods are only a bound from here,",
    "And I can outjump a deer, my dear!\u201d",
    "\u201cBut tell me, best beloved of men,",
    "Will you come again? Will you come again?\u201d",
    "\u201cGwen, you know I\u2019m your nightingale,",
    "And I\u2019ll be with you, without fail,",
    "When the cloud is cloak, and the dark is sky,",
    "And when the night comes, so will I.\u201d"

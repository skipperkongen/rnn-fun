    "There once was a Square, such a square little Square,",
    "And he loved a trim Triangle;",
    "But she was a flirt and around her skirt",
    "Vainly she made him dangle.",
    "Oh he wanted to wed and he had no dread",
    "Of domestic woes and wrangles;",
    "For he thought that his fate was to procreate",
    "Cute little Squares and Triangles.",
    "Now it happened one day on that geometric way",
    "There swaggered a big bold Cube,",
    "With a haughty stare and he made that Square",
    "Have the air of a perfect boob;",
    "To his solid spell the Triangle fell,",
    "And she thrilled with love\u2019s sweet sickness,",
    "For she took delight in his breadth and height\u2014",
    "But how she adored his thickness!",
    "So that poor little Square just died of despair,",
    "For his love he could not strangle;",
    "While the bold Cube led to the bridal bed",
    "That cute and acute Triangle.",
    "The Square\u2019s sad lot she has long forgot,",
    "And his passionate pretensions ...",
    "For she dotes on her kids\u2014Oh such cute",
    "In a world of three dimensions."

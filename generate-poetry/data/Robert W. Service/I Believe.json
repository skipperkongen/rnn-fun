    "It\u2019s my belief that every man",
    "Should do his share of work,",
    "And in our economic plan",
    "No citizen should shirk.",
    "That in return each one should get",
    "His meed of fold and food,",
    "And feel that all his toil and sweat",
    "Is for the common good.",
    "It\u2019s my belief that every chap",
    "Should have an equal start,",
    "And there should be no handicap",
    "To hinder his depart;",
    "That there be fairness in the fight,",
    "And justice in the race,",
    "And every lad should have the right",
    "To win his proper place.",
    "It\u2019s my belief that people should",
    "Be neither rich nor poor;",
    "That none should suffer servitude,",
    "And all should be secure.",
    "That wealth is loot, and rank is rot,",
    "And foul is class and clan;",
    "That to succeed a man may not",
    "Exploit his brother man.",
    "It\u2019s my belief that heritage",
    "And usury are wrong;",
    "That each should win a worthy wage",
    "And sing an honest song ....",
    "Not one like this \u2014 for though I rue",
    "The wrong of life, I flout it.",
    "Alas! I\u2019m not prepared to do",
    "A goddam thing about it."

    "I will not wash my face;",

    "Snow-peaks and deep-gashed draws",
    "Corral me in a ring.",
    "I feel as if I was",
    "The only living thing",
    "On all this blighted earth;",
    "And so I frowst and shrink,",
    "And crouching by my hearth,",

    "The boys I used to know;",
    "The girls I used to kiss;",

    "Only a little worse;",
    "No one to grouch or blame \u0097",
    "Oh, for a loving curse!",
    "Oh, in the night I fear,",
    "Haunted by nameless things,",
    "Just for a voice to cheer,",

    "Voices of ghosts afar,",
    "Not in this world of mine.",
    "Lives in whose loom I grope;",
    "Words in whose weft I hear",
    "Eager the thrill of hope,",
    "Awful the chill of fear.",
    "I'm thinking out aloud;",
    "I reckon that is bad;",
    "(The snow is like a shroud) \u0097",
    "Maybe I'm going mad.",

    "A music-hall aglow;",
    "A crowd, a city, life \u0097",
    "Dear God, I miss it so!",
    "Here, you have moped enough!",
    "Brace up and play the game!",
    "But say, it's awful tough \u0097",
    "Day after day the same",
    "(I've said that twice, I bet).",

    "God shield you from the Fear;",
    "Teach you to laugh, not moan.",
    "Ha! ha! it sounds so queer \u0097",
    "Alone, alone, alone."

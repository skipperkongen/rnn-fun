    "I strolled up old Bonanza, where I staked in ninety-eight,",
    "A-purpose to revisit the old claim.",
    "I kept thinking mighty sadly of the funny ways of Fate,",
    "And the lads who once were with me in the game.",
    "Poor boys, they\u2019re down-and-outers, and there\u2019s scarcely one to-day",
    "Can show a dozen colors in his poke;",
    "And me, I\u2019m still prospecting, old and battered, gaunt and gray,",
    "And I\u2019m looking for a grub-stake, and I\u2019m broke.",
    "I strolled up old Bonanza. The same old moon looked down;",
    "The same old landmarks seemed to yearn to me;",
    "But the cabins all were silent, and the flat, once like a town,",
    "Was mighty still and lonesome-like to see.",
    "There were piles and piles of tailings where we toiled with pick and pan,",
    "And turning round a bend I heard a roar,",
    "And there a giant gold-ship of the very newest plan",
    "Was tearing chunks of pay-dirt from the shore.",
    "It wallowed in its water-bed; it burrowed, heaved and swung;",
    "It gnawed its way ahead with grunts and sighs;",
    "Its bill of fare was rock and sand; the tailings were its dung;",
    "It glared around with fierce electric eyes.",
    "Full fifty buckets crammed its maw; it bellowed out for more;",
    "It looked like some great monster in the gloom.",
    "With two to feed its sateless greed, it worked for seven score,",
    "And I sighed: \u201cAh, old-time miner, here\u2019s your doom!\u201d",
    "The idle windlass turns to rust; the sagging sluice-box falls;",
    "The holes you digged are water to the brim;",
    "Your little sod-roofed cabins with the snugly moss-chinked walls",
    "Are deathly now and mouldering and dim.",
    "The battle-field is silent where of old you fought it out;",
    "The claims you fiercely won are lost and sold.",
    "But there\u2019s a little army that they\u2019ll never put to rout \u2014",
    "The men who simply live to seek the gold.",
    "The men who can\u2019t remember when they learned to swing a pack,",
    "Or in what lawless land the quest began;",
    "The solitary seeker with his grub-stake on his back,",
    "The restless buccaneer of pick and pan.",
    "On the mesas of the Southland, on the tundras of the North,",
    "You will find us, changed in face but still the same;",
    "And it isn\u2019t need, it isn\u2019t greed that sends us faring forth \u2014",
    "It\u2019s the fever, it\u2019s the glory of the game.",
    "For once you\u2019ve panned the speckled sand and seen the bonny dust,",
    "Its peerless brightness blinds you like a spell;",
    "It\u2019s little else you care about; you go because you must,",
    "And you feel that you could follow it to hell.",
    "You\u2019d follow it in hunger, and you\u2019d follow it in cold;",
    "You\u2019d follow it in solitude and pain;",
    "And when you\u2019re stiff and battened down let someone whisper \u201cGold,\u201d",
    "You\u2019re lief to rise and follow it again.",
    "Yet look you, if I find the stuff it\u2019s just like so much dirt;",
    "I fling it to the four winds like a child.",
    "It\u2019s wine and painted women and the things that do me hurt,",
    "Till I crawl back, beggared, broken, to the Wild.",
    "Till I crawl back, sapped and sodden, to my grub-stake and my tent \u2014",
    "There\u2019s a city, there\u2019s an army (hear them shout).",
    "There\u2019s the gold in millions, millions, but I haven\u2019t got a cent;",
    "And oh, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s me that found it out.",
    "It was my dream that made it good, my dream that made me go",
    "To lands of dread and death disprized of man;",
    "But oh, I\u2019ve known a glory that their hearts will never know,",
    "When I picked the first big nugget from my pan.",
    "It\u2019s still my dream, my dauntless dream, that drives me forth once more",
    "To seek and starve and suffer in the Vast;",
    "That heaps my heart with eager hope, that glimmers on before \u2014",
    "My dream that will uplift me to the last.",
    "Perhaps I am stark crazy, but there\u2019s none of you too sane;",
    "It\u2019s just a little matter of degree.",
    "My hobby is to hunt out gold; it\u2019s fortressed in my brain;",
    "It\u2019s life and love and wife and home to me.",
    "And I\u2019ll strike it, yes, I\u2019ll strike it; I\u2019ve a hunch I cannot fail;",
    "I\u2019ve a vision, I\u2019ve a prompting, I\u2019ve a call;",
    "I hear the hoarse stampeding of an army on my trail,",
    "To the last, the greatest gold camp of them all.",
    "Beyond the shark-tooth ranges sawing savage at the sky",
    "There\u2019s a lowering land no white man ever struck;",
    "There\u2019s gold, there\u2019s gold in millions, and I\u2019ll find it if I die.",
    "And I\u2019m going there once more to try my luck.",
    "Maybe I\u2019ll fail \u2014 what matter? It\u2019s a mandate, it\u2019s a vow;",
    "And when in lands of dreariness and dread",
    "You seek the last lone frontier, far beyond your frontiers now,",
    "You will find the old prospector, silent, dead.",
    "You will find a rusted gold-pan on the sod;",
    "You will find the claim I\u2019m seeking, with my bones as stakes to show it;",
    "But I\u2019ve sought the last Recorder, and He\u2019s \u2014 God."

    "I wanted the gold, and I sought it;",
    "I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.",
    "Was it famine or scurvy",
    "I fought it;",
    "I hurled my youth into a grave.",
    "I wanted the gold, and I got it",
    "\ufeff",
    "Came out with a fortune last fall,",
    "Yet somehow life\u2019s not what I thought it,",
    "And somehow the gold isn\u2019t all.",
    "No! There\u2019s the land. (Have you seen it?)",
    "It\u2019s the cussedest land that I know,",
    "From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it",
    "To the deep, deathlike valleys below.",
    "Some say God was tired when He made it;",
    "Some say it\u2019s a fine land to shun;",
    "Maybe; but there\u2019s some as would trade it",
    "For no land on earth",
    "and I\u2019m one.",
    "You come to get rich (damned good reason);",
    "You feel like an exile at first;",
    "You hate it like hell for a season,",
    "And then you are worse than the worst.",
    "It grips you like some kinds of sinning;",
    "It twists you from foe to a friend;",
    "It seems it\u2019s been since the beginning;",
    "It seems it will be to the end.",
    "I\u2019ve stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow",
    "That\u2019s plumb-full of hush to the brim;",
    "I\u2019ve watched the big, husky sun wallow",
    "In crimson and gold, and grow dim,",
    "Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,",
    "And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;",
    "And I\u2019ve thought that I surely was dreaming,",
    "With the peace o\u2019 the world piled on top.",
    "The summer",
    "\ufeffno sweeter was ever;",
    "The sunshiny woods all athrill;",
    "The grayling aleap in the river,",
    "The bighorn asleep on the hill.",
    "The strong life that never knows harness;",
    "The wilds where the caribou call;",
    "The freshness, the freedom, the farness",
    "\ufeff",
    "O God! how I\u2019m stuck on it all.",
    "The winter! the brightness that blinds you,",
    "The white land locked tight as a drum,",
    "The cold fear that follows and finds you,",
    "The silence that bludgeons you dumb.",
    "The snows that are older than history,",
    "The woods where the weird shadows slant;",
    "The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery,",
    "I\u2019ve bade \u2019em good-by",
    "\ufeffbut I can\u2019t.",
    "There\u2019s a land where the mountains are nameless,",
    "And the rivers all run God knows where;",
    "There are lives that are erring and aimless,",
    "And deaths that just hang by a hair;",
    "There are hardships that nobody reckons;",
    "There are valleys unpeopled and still;",
    "There\u2019s a land",
    "\ufeffoh, it beckons and beckons,",
    "And I want to go back",
    "\ufeffand I will.",
    "They\u2019re making my money diminish;",
    "I\u2019m sick of the taste of champagne.",
    "Thank God! when I\u2019m skinned to a finish",
    "I\u2019ll pike to the Yukon again.",
    "I\u2019ll fight",
    "\ufeffand you bet it\u2019s no sham-fight;",
    "It\u2019s hell!",
    "\ufeffbut I\u2019ve been there before;",
    "And it\u2019s better than this by a damsite",
    "\ufeff",
    "So me for the Yukon once more.",
    "There\u2019s gold, and it\u2019s haunting and haunting;",
    "It\u2019s luring me on as of old;",
    "Yet it isn\u2019t the gold that I\u2019m wanting",
    "So much as just finding the gold.",
    "It\u2019s the great, big, broad land \u2019way up yonder,",
    "It\u2019s the forests where silence has lease;",
    "It\u2019s the beauty that thrills me with wonder,",
    "It\u2019s the stillness that fills me with peace."

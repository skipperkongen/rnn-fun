    "It\u2019s fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant,",
    "With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want;",
    "To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass,",
    "Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass.",
    "It\u2019s bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,",
    "But it\u2019s quite another matter when you",
    "Pay the bill.",
    "It\u2019s great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent;",
    "To wear your glad rags always and to never save a cent;",
    "To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip;",
    "To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip;",
    "To know you\u2019re acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still,",
    "Till Nature calls a show-down, and you",
    "Pay the bill.",
    "Time has got a little bill \u2014 get wise while yet you may,",
    "For the debit side\u2019s increasing in a most alarming way;",
    "The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done,",
    "They\u2019re all put down; it\u2019s up to you to pay for every one.",
    "So eat, drink and be merry, have a good time if you will,",
    "But God help you when the time comes, and you",
    "Foot the bill."

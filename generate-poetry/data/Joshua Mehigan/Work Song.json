    "This fastening, unfastening, and heaving\u2014",
    "this is our life. Whose life is it improving?",
    "It topples some. Some others it will toughen.",
    "Work is the safest way to fail, and often",
    "the simplest way to love a son or daughter.",
    "We come. We carp. We\u2019re fired. We worry later.",
    "That man is strange. His calipers are shiny.",
    "His hands are black. For lunch he brings baloney,",
    "and, offered coffee, answers, \u201cThank you, no.\u201d",
    "That man, with nothing evil left to do",
    "and two small skills to stir some interest up,",
    "fits in the curtained corner of a shop.",
    "The best part of our life is disappearing",
    "into the john to sneak a smoke, or staring",
    "at screaming non-stop mills, our eyes unfocused,",
    "or standing judging whose sick joke is sickest.",
    "Yet nothing you could do could break our silence.",
    "We are a check. Do not expect a balance.",
    "That is a wrathful man becoming older,",
    "a nobody like us, turned mortgage holder.",
    "We stay until the bell. That man will stay",
    "ten minutes more, so no one can complain.",
    "Each day, by then, he\u2019s done exactly ten.",
    "Ten what, exactly, no one here can say."

    "The clear orange bottle was empty.",
    "It had been empty a day.",
    "It suddenly seemed so costly",
    "and uncalled for anyway.",
    "Two years had passed. They had passed",
    "more or less the way years should.",
    "Maybe he\u2019d changed. Or maybe",
    "the doctors had misunderstood.",
    "It was June. The enormous elm tree",
    "was green again, and the scent",
    "of hyacinth reached through the window",
    "and followed wherever he went.",
    "And the sky was the firmament!",
    "His life was never better.",
    "Each small white spotless cloud that passed",
    "was like a long-wished-for letter.",
    "But then he remembered his promise.",
    "It came like a mild cramp,",
    "and it sat there all day in the back of his mind",
    "like a gas bill awaiting a stamp.",
    "He saw three faces that Sunday,",
    "mother, sister, niece,",
    "all with the same kind, brown, scared eyes",
    "that brought him no peace.",
    "The sidewalk sparrows were peeping.",
    "His whole house smelled like a flower.",
    "But he remembered his promise.",
    "The drugstore said one hour.",
    "Back home again, he was tired.",
    "The label said caution, said warning.",
    "He left the clear orange bottle",
    "on the lip of the sink till morning.",
    "The insert said warning, said caution.",
    "The insert said constipation.",
    "It said insomnia, vivid dreams,",
    "and hypersalivation,",
    "and increased urination,",
    "and a spinning sensation.",
    "It also said night sweats, and",
    "agranulocytosis,",
    "and strongly suggested a full glass of water",
    "be drunk with all doses.",
    "The insert said all this,",
    "the insert he never read.",
    "But he didn\u2019t have to read it",
    "to know what it said.",
    "The bedroom was calm with moonlight",
    "and the breeze through the screen was cooling.",
    "Through the elm leaves the shivery light on the wall",
    "came like quicksilver pooling.",
    "But just before five, something woke him \u2014",
    "a close whisper \u2014 or maybe a far cry \u2014",
    "and the bedroom was queasy with light the color",
    "of lapis lazuli.",
    "He lay there listening hard",
    "till six, till seven, till eight ...",
    "At nine he remembered the bottle.",
    "But nine, nine was too late.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the Clozapine.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the pill.",
    "By ten he was feeling restless,",
    "with a whole day left to kill.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the Clozapine.",
    "\u201cYes, don\u2019t!\u201d cried the medication.",
    "And the bright yellow morning seemed suddenly edged",
    "with a shady fascination.",
    "Why should he go to his workplace?",
    "Who was his supervisor?",
    "He had a sickening feeling",
    "that he was becoming wiser.",
    "His room filled up with interest.",
    "He had begun to think!",
    "He thought of the knives in the kitchen",
    "and the bottles under the sink.",
    "He thought as he switched the stove on",
    "or stood at his shaving mirror,",
    "or reached for his belt in the wardrobe.",
    "Thinking made things clearer.",
    "Even the bedroom window,",
    "the open window full of sun,",
    "continually hinted",
    "at something that should be done.",
    "But he was crooked and useless.",
    "He was a piece of shit.",
    "And so, as everyone knew he would,",
    "he failed to go through with it.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the Clozapine.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the drug.",
    "Just then, the telephone rang.",
    "Just then, he ripped out the plug.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the Clozapine.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the poison.",
    "And the door of the house creaked open,",
    "and the cellar door lilted and murmured,",
    "and the garden gate groaned and yawned",
    "and let a little noise in.",
    "There, just outside his window,",
    "lurked life like a cheap cartoon.",
    "He shut the sash, locked it, and checked it,",
    "and checked it all afternoon.",
    "He lowered the blinds on that world,",
    "no longer an agent of it,",
    "but then, with one finger, pulled down a slat",
    "and set his eye above it.",
    "At first it was grimly amusing,",
    "at last it was grimly grim,",
    "to watch all those hunched, hurried people,",
    "who made like they weren\u2019t watching him.",
    "The neighbors were thinking out loud.",
    "They knew he was no fucking good.",
    "So he slumped on a stool in the corner",
    "like a bad little snaggletooth should.",
    "They called him a dirty pig, and laughed,",
    "and said he shouldn\u2019t exist.",
    "Sometimes they made a tsking sound,",
    "or oinked at him, or hissed.",
    "They hissed that he was to blame",
    "for everything, and everyone knew it,",
    "and that if he weren\u2019t such a pussy",
    "he\u2019d know what to do, and he\u2019d do it.",
    "He lay on his side on the rug",
    "unable to move at all",
    "except for his big right toe,",
    "which dug and dug at the wall,",
    "which dug at the wall,",
    "which dug.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the Clozapine.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the cure.",
    "And they begged him to sew his mouth shut",
    "just to make goddamn sure.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the Clozapine.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the poison.",
    "And the gate to the wicked city gaped,",
    "and the gates of the temple screamed and screamed,",
    "and the gates of the garden groaned and yawned,",
    "and the gates of the ziggurat gabbled in grief,",
    "and sucked all life\u2019s sorrows and joys in.",
    "His thoughts were advancing like wolves.",
    "He lay still for an hour and a half,",
    "then reared up onto his rickety legs",
    "like a newborn calf.",
    "Then rug",
    "hall",
    "stairs",
    "porch",
    "stoop",
    "street",
    "and the blacktop humanly warm",
    "on the soles of his naked feet.",
    "His walk was stiffened by fear,",
    "but it took him where he was going,",
    "into the terrible world",
    "of children and daffodils growing,",
    "and friendly people helloing,",
    "and the Super out doing the mowing,",
    "and the two old sisters out in wool sweaters with their wrinkled",
    "cheeks pinkly glowing,",
    "and the pretty lady who would give birth by Christmas barely",
    "showing but showing,",
    "and the policeman helping to keep the lazy afternoon traffic",
    "flowing,",
    "and time itself slowing,",
    "and none of them, none of them knowing",
    "that an odious axis was forming,",
    "that it would not be controlled,",
    "that schemes were afoot, that a foot",
    "was a thing for a jackboot to hold,",
    "that the street was a movie set,",
    "that it was not warm and sunny,",
    "that a creditor was calling",
    "who could not be paid with money,",
    "that the world was like a sliver",
    "of iron held in the hand,",
    "and his mind the lodestone above it",
    "that made it stir or stand,",
    "that the air was slowly changing",
    "to a color they didn\u2019t know,",
    "that he was a famous doctor",
    "on a television show.",
    "But what could he do? Even friends",
    "would take these facts for lies,",
    "and he couldn\u2019t tell who the enemies were,",
    "though he felt the hot breath of their eyes,",
    "so he kept his big mouth shut",
    "and tried to play along,",
    "and plowed down the street toward the coffeeshop",
    "as if nothing at all were wrong.",
    "He tried not to notice the numbers",
    "painted on garbage cans.",
    "He tried and he tried not to look",
    "at the black unmarked sedans.",
    "The coffeeshop smelled like coffee,",
    "but it felt different inside.",
    "A new waitress went by. She winked.",
    "He kept his eyes open wide.",
    "Everything screamed \u201cRun away!\u201d",
    "But he wasn\u2019t really there!",
    "So he stood by the gumball machines",
    "and smiled and tried not to stare.",
    "\u201cThe power is yours!\u201d said a T-shirt.",
    "\u201cLook for lightning!\u201d reported the weather.",
    "And the stranger who offered the Sports section said,",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s all there, Chief. Just put it together.\u201d",
    "Then wild-eyed out of the kitchen",
    "stormed a small, hard old man,",
    "shouting in a strange language",
    "and waving a frying pan,",
    "shoving him out the door",
    "and into the chattering street,",
    "shoving him, waving, shouting,",
    "and pointing at his feet,",
    "at his bare, gray feet.",
    "Then came the dark blue uniform,",
    "the badge glinting in the sun,",
    "and the belt jangling like a storm trooper\u2019s",
    "as the boots broke into a run.",
    "\u201cTake that!\u201d cried the patrolman.",
    "\u201cTake that!\u201d cried Johnny Law.",
    "Street, knee, neck \u2014",
    "cuffs, curb, jaw.",
    "And the flatfoot pushed him, bleeding,",
    "into the sleek cruiser,",
    "and he heard all the gawkers thinking",
    "that he was a pig and a loser,",
    "and his chin throbbed,",
    "and the handcuffs ate at his wrist,",
    "and he would be hacked into pieces soon",
    "and would not be missed.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the victim.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t take me!\u201d cried the threat.",
    "But the angry back of a head",
    "was the only response he could get.",
    "Lying on his side like a child",
    "at the end of a big day,",
    "he gazed up through the window",
    "and watched it all slip away.",
    "The little pen where they put him",
    "had a toilet but no stall.",
    "Here and there a message",
    "scarred the gloss-white wall.",
    "Time passed. But you couldn\u2019t tell it",
    "on the trapped fly ticking the ceiling,",
    "or the flickering light overhead,",
    "or the sore on his chin congealing,",
    "or on the sound of the other pigs in the other pens, squealing.",
    "When the men came, he was ready.",
    "He talked. They took it all down.",
    "And soon they were back in the cruiser,",
    "on their way across town.",
    "Then, into the mirrored building,",
    "over the waxed lobby floors,",
    "down miles of echoing hallways,",
    "through the heavy brown doors,",
    "into a humming beige room",
    "with a bed and a river view,",
    "and an outside lock, and jailers",
    "who wore white instead of blue.",
    "\u201cTake that,\u201d smiled the doctor.",
    "\u201cTake that,\u201d smiled the nurse.",
    "He pressed his lips still tighter,",
    "and things got worse and worse.",
    "\u201cPlease!\u201d threatened the nurse.",
    "\u201cPlease!\u201d growled the doctor.",
    "He raised his fists to cover his mouth,",
    "but the nurse was too close, and he clocked her.",
    "Now into the room came the big men,",
    "who did not clamor or shout,",
    "but pinned him with ease to the bed,",
    "strapped him down, and went out.",
    "And the doctor was there again, trailing",
    "a spider web of cologne,",
    "and the doctor told what would happen next,",
    "in an expert monotone,",
    "and the nurse took a needle",
    "and emptied it into his arm,",
    "and they both left, content",
    "that he could do no more harm,",
    "and he fought, and the straps cut his shoulders,",
    "and he gnawed at his lip, and it bled,",
    "and he held his bladder for three long hours,",
    "then shivered and pissed the bed.",
    "When the doctor came a fifth time,",
    "it was long past dawn.",
    "They\u2019d found him a room, said the doctor,",
    "gently restraining a yawn.",
    "The next two days were sleep,",
    "and words through a fine white mist.",
    "Then he woke inside a machine",
    "whose motion he couldn\u2019t resist:",
    "\u201cTick-tock,\u201d said the clock.",
    "\u201cCreak, creak,\u201d said the bed.",
    "\u201cDrip, drip,\u201d said the sink.",
    "\u201cThrob, throb,\u201d went his head.",
    "\u201cHo-hum,\u201d sighed the night nurse.",
    "\u201cHeh-heh,\u201d said the sicko.",
    "\u201cWhy? Why?\u201d screamed the patient.",
    "\u201cHowl, howl!\u201d cried the psycho.",
    "\u201cWolf! Wolf!\u201d cried the boy.",
    "\u201cGobble, gobble!\u201d sang the freaks.",
    "\u201cSa, sa!\u201d cried the king.",
    "\u201cTick-tock,\u201d went the weeks.",
    "\u201cBang, bang,\u201d said the tv.",
    "\u201cTeeter-totter,\u201d went his brain.",
    "\u201cClick, click,\u201d went the checkers.",
    "\u201cPitter-patter,\u201d went the rain.",
    "\u201cBring-bring,\u201d said the pay phone.",
    "\u201cSnip, snip,\u201d went Fate.",
    "\u201cJangle-jingle,\u201d went the keys.",
    "\u201cClank-clink,\u201d went the gate.",
    "\u201cBye-bye,\u201d said the nurse.",
    "\u201cBye-bye,\u201d said the guard.",
    "\u201cBar-bar,\u201d said the doctor.",
    "\u201cBaa-baa,\u201d said the lamb.",
    "\u201cMy, my,\u201d said his mother.",
    "\u201cBoohoo!\u201d cried Bo Peep.",
    "\u201cBow-wow,\u201d said the wolf.",
    "\u201cBaa-baa,\u201d said the sheep.",
    "In the car away from that place,",
    "the family had a pleasant chat.",
    "He seemed fine again, and humble,",
    "though his speech was oddly flat.",
    "He said that the halfway house",
    "where he would be residing",
    "was located on a quiet block and had",
    "green vinyl siding.",
    "There he met new people",
    "and watched the television,",
    "which did not watch him back",
    "or speak to him with derision,",
    "and he performed certain tasks,",
    "meant to teach certain skills,",
    "and he got small checks from the government",
    "to pay his enormous bills.",
    "Each night he fell asleep,",
    "and each morning he got up,",
    "and he washed down his medicine",
    "and squashed the paper cup,",
    "feeling, in all, much better,",
    "more in touch with common sense,",
    "and also slightly bored",
    "by the lack of consequence.",
    "And the church bells rang",
    "and a dinner bell tinkled",
    "and the school bell tolled",
    "and called all the good girls and boys in.",
    "And all of them brought all their toys in.",
    "And all of them swallowed their poison."

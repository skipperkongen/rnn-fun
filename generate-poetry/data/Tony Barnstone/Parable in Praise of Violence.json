    "Thanks for the violence. Thanks for Walt\u2019s rude muscle",
    "pushing through the grass, for tiny Gulliver crushed",
    "between the giant\u2019s breasts. Thanks for Moby\u2019s triangular hump",
    "and Ahab\u2019s castrated leg. Thanks for the harpoons.",
    "Thanks for this PBS history of the automatic pistol.",
    "The good machine is simple, few moving parts,",
    "an efficiency of what\u2019s preserved and what is wasted,",
    "so with each shot the recoil cocks the gun to shoot again,",
    "then recoil, cock and shoot again, recoil, cock,",
    "and so on till the target buys it, or your ammo\u2019s spent.",
    "Thanks for the poem, which is really a little pistol:",
    "load and cock, point and aim, then the trigger,",
    "the hammer, the powder, the discharge, the bullet,",
    "the target, the recoil, the crime. No smoking gun,",
    "just ballistics, caliber, powder marks, the question",
    ".",
    "My life is like a loaded gun, and when I aim it at you",
    "I hope to take off the top of your head,",
    "no safety on, no playing nice, just the spark,",
    "the flash, the damage, just red American",
    "cherry pie violence. So, thank you",
    "for the harpoon gun we aim at God and death",
    "and all the unknown world, and for the spear-stuck beast,",
    "rope ripping through torn hands, for what",
    "refuses to be caught and what we fathom only by",
    "riding the whale down into the deep, refusing to let go."

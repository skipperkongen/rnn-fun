    "\u201cI know kung fu.\u201d It won\u2019t bring back the world.",
    "5:15 a.m.: I wake from another dream,",
    "the same as every dream. A man builds a ship",
    "in my chest. Each of the sailors",
    "carries by her breast a picture of her sister.",

    "Beyond its sails there are no stars.",

    "5:15 a.m. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen me",
    "practicing my moves in the empty prison yard",
    "and wondered whether you were the dreamer",
    "conjuring me into existence from the bare",
    "desire to caress a phantom ship",
    "and my death the death of your desire."

    "The dragonflies again; the last time seeing them",
    "skim the river close",
    "to forgotten \u2014 their singing,",
    "their shimmer \u2014 now remembered, becoming so much",
    "flame;",
    "as tongues over the heads of the chosen in the child\u2019s picture",
    "book of Christ I learned by heart, descent and weight of after",
    "the fact, the gift",
    "the fork",
    "between hope and vanity, the river that eats",
    "itself turned mirror broken into",
    "light; the corpse",
    "between the beloved\u2019s good word",
    "and the beloved",
    "who having spoken was ever spoken",
    "into being, lies, unspeaking, and as with any heaviness that lowers",
    "then hovers, remains",
    "inconceivable; so the letter given in stone, perfection",
    "in fire;",
    "love; all",
    "love\u2019s failures; the winged animal",
    "drops to the earth and is there buried in a hole where it digs",
    "in the grit like the blade",
    "we left in the riverbed, adrift and cry-",
    "shaped in the memory, both",
    "that dim and that loud; though",
    "no accosting why it",
    "seems that way, everything ghost",
    "of itself or everything made",
    "of mythic proportion, the walker",
    "sinking from the face of the waters, the dragon I",
    "become when I talk to myself, what a belief",
    "is, terrifying",
    "and relentless; I\u2019ve never been",
    "able to tell the difference;",
    "the brute and the apparition",
    "in reflection speak at once \u2014 the rock and the rock\u2019s light \u2014",
    "so that now the insect thrums",
    "and it is surely",
    "a kind of tenderness, an ODing in secret, turning into while turning",
    "from the soul the animal raised",
    "and devoured in dream; imagine,",
    "the child\u2019s wished-for surface gives and ripples up",
    "to mouth",
    "the perfect imprint, saying \u201caircraft\u201d and there are aircraft, amen,",
    "the walker is surrounded by flight on all sides;",
    "the walker",
    "walks without wings; see,",
    "the recollection is flawless, turning wings of jewels;",
    "the recollection is absolute, swallows whole;",
    "echoes;",
    "and the dragon feasts; and the dragon flies again;"

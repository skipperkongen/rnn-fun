    "As soon as possible, I will confront the wren\u2019s",

    "smell of water too much for all of us.",
    "But first is lunch. The remains we\u2019ll scatter over",
    "the driveway away from the bricks. Wrens come,",
    "crusts from our dishes make drama. Then history.",

    "the time you forgot your legs no longer",
    "could recall how to stand\u2014then rose up straight and sang",
    "Probably I\u2019ve been thinking of that since August.",
    "The indelible wrens grate like shovels",
    "outside\u2014exhumed, one voice rises from wilderness,",
    "echoes,",
    "settles, rests",
    "\u2014then another, and,",
    "between them, the keep of an unerring quiet."

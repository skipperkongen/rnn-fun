    "O King of terrors, whose unbounded sway",
    "All that have life must certainly obey;",
    "The King, the Priest, the Prophet, all are thine,",
    "Nor would ev\u2019n God (in flesh) thy stroke decline.",
    "My name is on thy roll, and sure I must",
    "Increase thy gloomy kingdom in the dust.",
    "My soul at this no apprehension feels,",
    "But trembles at thy swords, thy racks, thy wheels;",
    "Thy scorching fevers, which distract the sense,",
    "And snatch us raving, unprepared, from hence;",
    "At thy contagious darts, that wound the heads",
    "Of weeping friends, who wait at dying beds.",
    "Spare these, and let thy time be when it will;",
    "My bus\u2019ness is to die, and thine to kill.",
    "Gently thy fatal scepter on me lay,",
    "And take to thy cold arms, insensibly, thy prey."

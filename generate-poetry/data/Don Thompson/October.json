    "I used to think the land",
    "had something to say to us,",
    "back when wildflowers",
    "would come right up to your hand",
    "as if they were tame.",
    "Sooner or later, I thought,",
    "the wind would begin to make sense",
    "if I listened hard",
    "and took notes religiously.",
    "That was spring.",
    "Now I\u2019m not so sure:",
    "the cloudless sky has a flat affect",
    "and the fields plowed down after harvest",
    "seem so expressionless,",
    "keeping their own counsel.",
    "This afternoon, nut tree leaves",
    "blow across them",
    "as if autumn had written us a long letter,",
    "changed its mind,",
    "and tore it into little scraps."

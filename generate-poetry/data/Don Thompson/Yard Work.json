    "My leaf blower lifted the blackbird\u2014",
    "wings still spread, weightless,",
    "floating on the loud, electric wind",
    "almost as if it were alive.",
    "Three or four times it flew,",
    "but fell again, sideslipped down",
    "like a kite with no string,",
    "so I gave up. . . I had work to do,",
    "and when the dust I raised",
    "had settled in that other world",
    "under the rose bushes, the ants",
    "came back to finish theirs."

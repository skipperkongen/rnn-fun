    "Wise emblem of our politic world,",
    "Sage snail, within thine own self curl\u2019d;",
    "Instruct me softly to make haste,",
    "Whilst these my feet go slowly fast.",
    "Compendious snail! thou seem\u2019st to me,",
    "Large Euclid\u2019s strict epitome;",
    "And in each diagram dost fling",
    "Thee from the point unto the ring;",
    "A figure now triangular,",
    "An oval now, and now a square;",
    "And then a serpentine dost crawl,",
    "Now a straight line, now crook\u2019d, now all.",
    "Preventing rival of the day,",
    "Th\u2019art up and openest thy ray,",
    "And ere the morn cradles the moon",
    "Th\u2019art broke into a beauteous noon.",
    "Then when the sun sups in the deep,",
    "Thy silver horns ere Cynthia\u2019s peep;",
    "And thou from thine own liquid bed",
    "New Phoebus heav\u2019st thy pleasant head.",
    "Who shall a name for thee create,",
    "Deep riddle of mysterious state?",
    "Bold Nature that gives common birth",
    "To all products of seas and earth,",
    "Of thee, as earthquakes, is afraid,",
    "Nor will thy dire deliv\u2019ry aid.",
    "Thou thine own daughter then, and sire,",
    "That son and mother art entire,",
    "That big still with thy self dost go,",
    "And liv\u2019st an aged embryo;",
    "That like the cubs of India,",
    "Thou from thyself a while dost play;",
    "But frighted with a dog or gun,",
    "In thine own belly thou dost run,",
    "And as thy house was thine own womb,",
    "So thine own womb concludes thy tomb.",
    "But now I must (analyz\u2019d king)",
    "Thy economic virtues sing;",
    "Thou great stay\u2019d husband still within,",
    "Thou, thee, that\u2019s thine dost discipline;",
    "And when thou art to progress bent,",
    "Thou mov\u2019st thy self and tenement,",
    "As warlike Scythians travell\u2019d, you",
    "Remove your men and city too;",
    "Then after a sad dearth and rain,",
    "Thou scatterest thy silver train;",
    "And when the trees grow nak\u2019d and old,",
    "Thou clothest them with cloth of gold,",
    "Which from thy bowels thou dost spin,",
    "And draw from the rich mines within.",
    "Now hast thou chang\u2019d thee saint; and made",
    "Thy self a fane that\u2019s cupola\u2019d;",
    "And in thy wreathed cloister thou",
    "Walkest thine own grey friar too;",
    "Strict, and lock\u2019d up, th\u2019art hood all o\u2019er,",
    "And ne\u2019er eliminat\u2019st thy door.",
    "On salads thou dost feed severe,",
    "And \u2019stead of beads thou dropp\u2019st a tear;",
    "And when to rest, each calls the bell,",
    "Thou sleep\u2019st within thy marble cell,",
    "Where in dark contemplation plac\u2019d,",
    "The sweets of nature thou dost taste;",
    "Who now with time thy days resolve,",
    "And in a jelly thee dissolve,",
    "Like a shot star, which doth repair",
    "Upward, and rarify the air."

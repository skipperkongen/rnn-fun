    "Amarantha sweet and fair",
    "Ah braid no more that shining hair!",
    "As my curious hand or eye",
    "Hovering round thee let it fly.",
    "Let it fly as unconfin\u2019d",
    "As its calm ravisher, the wind,",
    "Who hath left his darling th\u2019East,",
    "To wanton o\u2019er that spicy nest.",
    "Ev\u2019ry tress must be confest",
    "But neatly tangled at the best;",
    "Like a clue of golden thread,",
    "Most excellently ravelled.",
    "Do not then wind up that light",
    "In ribands, and o\u2019er-cloud in night;",
    "Like the sun in\u2019s early ray,",
    "But shake your head and scatter day.",
    "See \u2019tis broke! Within this grove",
    "The bower, and the walks of love,",
    "Weary lie we down and rest,",
    "And fan each other\u2019s panting breast.",
    "Here we\u2019ll strip and cool our fire",
    "In cream below, in milk-baths higher:",
    "And when all wells are drawn dry,",
    "I\u2019ll drink a tear out of thine eye,",
    "Which our very joys shall leave",
    "That sorrows thus we can deceive;",
    "Or our very sorrows weep,",
    "That joys so ripe, so little keep."

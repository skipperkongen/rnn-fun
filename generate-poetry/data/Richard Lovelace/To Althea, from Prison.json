    "He is, how Great should be,",
    "Enlarg\u00e8d Winds, that curl the Flood,",

    "Stone Walls do not a Prison make,",
    "Nor Iron bars a Cage;",

    "That for an Hermitage.",
    "If I have freedom in my Love,",
    "And in my soul am free,",
    "Angels alone that soar above,",
    "Enjoy such Liberty."

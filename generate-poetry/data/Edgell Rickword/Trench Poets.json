    "I knew a man, he was my chum,",
    "but he grew blacker every day,",
    "and would not brush the flies away,",
    "nor blanch however fierce the hum",
    "of passing shells; I used to read,",
    "to rouse him, random things from Donne\u2014",
    "like \u201cGet with child a mandrake-root.\u201d",
    "But you can tell he was far gone,",
    "for he lay gaping, mackerel-eyed,",
    "and stiff, and senseless as a post",
    "even when that old poet cried",
    "\u201cI long to talk with some old lover\u2019s ghost.\u201d",
    "I tried the Elegies one day,",
    "But he, because he heard me say:",
    "\u201cWhat needst thou have no more covering than a man?\u201d",
    "grinned nastily, and so I knew",
    "the worms had got his brains at last.",
    "There was one thing that I might do",
    "to starve the worms; I racked my head",
    "for healthy things and quoted",
    ".",
    "His grin got worse and I could see",
    "he sneered at passion\u2019s purity.",
    "He stank so badly, though we were great chums",
    "I had to leave him; then rats ate his thumbs."

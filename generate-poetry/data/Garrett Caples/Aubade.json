    "the desire to show is destruction",
    "in lessons forgot before learned",
    "no shrunken heads hang by wires",
    "no mourning songs of half-remembered",
    "shutters open the width of an eyelash",
    "it is enough for vision to run",
    "its finger along, for access to steal",
    "from forbidden shores the still-cold",
    "beams of night and pack them in ice",
    "but a child couldn\u2019t live here nonetheless",
    "in the morning is come a bell that summons",
    "a fortune that reads",
    "and the intended instructions",
    "which may not florish after all",
    "she leaves a painting outside her room",
    "and in the morning it\u2019s gone",
    "and not one word is spoke between them",
    "but her father carries it to his grave",
    "the desire to show is destruction",
    "and we are not hung with skins",
    "we must follow internal echoes",
    "commit ourselves to memory"

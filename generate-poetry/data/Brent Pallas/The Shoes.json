    "When they first came",
    "their mouths agape",
    "their bodies shining",
    "like beetles about to stir",
    "every edge poised",
    "for the multitude of steps",
    "some moment",
    "of leaping not yet taken",
    "their hides stiff",
    "shielding some tenderness",
    "within, warming",
    "to the creak of movement",
    "over penitent steps",
    "or dusty wastes, unyielding",
    "tasks or stony memorials",
    "of waiting",
    "through the heat of day's",
    "quiet middle, every icy",
    "threshold or soggy spring",
    "their heels flush with pavement,",
    "their soles flung aside only",
    "for love, all the tattered",
    "maps of their seams, every",
    "unforgiving rub."

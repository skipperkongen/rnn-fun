    "My mother likes a man who works. She likes",
    "my husband\u2019s muddy knees, grass stains on the cuffs.",
    "She loved my father, though when weekends came",
    "he\u2019d sleep till nine and would not lift",
    "his eyes up from the page to move the feet",
    "she\u2019d vacuum under. On Saturdays my husband",
    "digs the holes for her new roses,",
    "softening the clay with peat and compost.",
    "He changes bulbs she can no longer reach",
    "and understands the inside of her toaster.",
    "My father\u2019s feet would carry him from chair",
    "to bookshelf, back again till Monday came.",
    "My mother likes to tell my husband",
    "sit down in this chair and put your feet up."

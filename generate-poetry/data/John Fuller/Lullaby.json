    "Sleep little baby, clean as a nut,",
    "Your fingers uncurl and your eyes are shut.",
    "Your life was ours, which is with you.",
    "Go on your journey. We go too.",
    "The bat is flying round the house",
    "Like an umbrella turned into a mouse.",
    "The moon is astonished and so are the sheep:",
    "Their bells have come to send you to sleep.",
    "Oh be our rest, our hopeful start.",
    "Turn your head to my beating heart.",
    "Sleep little baby, clean as a nut,",
    "Your fingers uncurl and your eyes are shut."

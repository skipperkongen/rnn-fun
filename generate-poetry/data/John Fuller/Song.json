    "You don\u2019t listen to what I say.",
    "When I lean towards you in the car",
    "You simply smile and turn away.",
    "It\u2019s been like this most of the day,",
    "sitting and sipping, bar after bar:",
    "You don\u2019t listen to what I say.",
    "You squeeze a lemon from a tray,",
    "And if you guess how dear you are",
    "You simply smile and turn away.",
    "Beyond the hairline of the bay",
    "the steamers call that shore is far.",
    "You don\u2019t listen to what I say:",
    "Surely there\u2019s another way?",
    "The waiter brings a small guitar.",
    "You simply smile and turn away.",
    "Sometimes I think you are too gay,",
    "smiling and smiling, hour after hour.",
    "You don\u2019t listen to what I say.",
    "You simply smile and turn away."

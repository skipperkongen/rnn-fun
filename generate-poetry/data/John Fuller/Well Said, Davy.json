    "He went to the city and goosed all the girls",
    "With a stall on his finger for whittling the wills",
    "To a clause in his favour and Come to me Sally,",
    "One head in my chambers and one up your alley",
    "And I am as old as my master.",
    "I followed him further and lost all my friends,",
    "The grease still thick on his fistful of pens.",
    "I laced up his mutton and paddled his lake",
    "In the game of Get-off-me and Just-for-my-sake",
    "And I am as old as my master.",
    "I sang in his service a farewell to sorrow",
    "With rolled black stockings, the bone and the marrow.",
    "The Law was a devil to cheat as you pleased",
    "As we knelt on the backs of the city girls\u2019 knees",
    "And I am as old as my master.",
    "So back to the country where birds are squawking,",
    "With possets for pensions and witless talking",
    "Of walloped starvelings and soldiers\u2019 fortunes",
    "From his nodding bench in the smothered orchards",
    "And I am as old as my master.",
    "Age turns the cheek of a buried scandal",
    "In a nightmare of cheese and a quarter of candle.",
    "When the servant is privy he\u2019s good as a guest,",
    "The first to be carved to and last to be pressed",
    "And I am as old as my master.",
    "Country or city, no pleasure can last:",
    "It\u2019s farewell to the future and beckon the past.",
    "Though he that we drink with is sometimes a fool,",
    "A single grey tooth may furnish a smile",
    "And I am as old as my master."

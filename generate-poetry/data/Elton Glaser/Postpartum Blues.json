    "Soon the glass angel must be",
    "Wrapped and packed and put away,",
    "And this hard year swept out",
    "Like tinsel from the Christmas tree\u2014",
    "The end of December, aromatic",
    "In its homely smoke, and the thin limbs",
    "Of maple and ash, the pipecleaner pines,",
    "Brushing themselves against",
    "The cold carbons of evening.",
    "I've watched the ice turn",
    "Little knifeblades in the grass.",
    "Sly beneath them, the mole",
    "Knows what to do with dirt\u2014",
    "Shoulder it aside, crumb by claw,",
    "And build a city deep,",
    "A labyrinth of dark",
    "Under the stone and the root.",
    "I think I could live there.",
    "I think I could make",
    "A music of my own. Thinking",
    "Makes a music of its own.",
    "You can hear it when",
    "Some stray phrase stumbles down",
    "The rabbit hole, a few words",
    "That broke from the brain",
    "And won't go back, always",
    "One step ahead of the real.",
    "But what's in the way",
    "To the way in? God,",
    "That desperate explanation,",
    "Mentor and tormentor, giving us",
    "The duties of paradise,",
    "Obligations of the saved?",
    "And is my way in",
    "This abyss of the belly, where they",
    "Tied the first knot in my life?",
    "Even the virgin must have felt",
    "The postpartum blues, crazy enough",
    "To pin sweet curls in her hair,",
    "Shavings she picked up from",
    "The floor of the carpenter's shop.",
    "I think I can still hear",
    "The baby wailing. Or is that cry",
    "The dead beating on their graves",
    "For the earth to open\u2014",
    "And to let them out, or to let us in?"

    "Boston snowbound, Logan closed, snowplows",
    "and salt-trucks flashing yellow, drifts",
    "tall as a man some places, visibility poor,",
    "I sit by the window and watch the snow",
    "blow sideways north-northeast, hot cup",
    "in hand, robe over pajamas.",
    "You have made me to seek refuge",
    "and charged me to care for my brothers.",
    "How cruel. That could be You out there",
    "howling, cracking the trees, burying everything.",
    "What could I possibly want from You",
    "that would not undo the whole world as it is?"

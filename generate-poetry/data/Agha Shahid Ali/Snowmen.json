    "My ancestor, a man",
    "of Himalayan snow,",
    "came to Kashmir from Samarkand,",

    "His skeleton",
    "carved from glaciers, his breath",
    "arctic,",
    "he froze women in his embrace.",
    "His wife thawed into stony water,",
    "her old age a clear",
    "evaporation.",
    "This heirloom,",
    "his skeleton under my skin, passed",
    "from son to grandson,",
    "generations of snowmen on my back.",
    "They tap every year on my window,",
    "their voices hushed to ice.",
    "No, they won\u2019t let me out of winter,",
    "and I\u2019ve promised myself,",
    "even if I\u2019m the last snowman,",
    "that I\u2019ll ride into spring",
    "on their melting shoulders."

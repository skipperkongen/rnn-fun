    "We shall meet again, in Srinagar,",
    "by the gates of the Villa of Peace,",
    "our hands blossoming into fists",
    "till the soldiers return the keys",
    "and disappear. Again we\u2019ll enter",
    "our last world, the first that vanished",
    "in our absence from the broken city.",
    "We\u2019ll tear our shirts for tourniquets",
    "and bind the open thorns, warm the ivy",
    "into roses. Quick, by the pomegranate\u2014",
    "the bird will say\u2014Humankind can bear",
    "everything. No need to stop the ear",
    "to stories rumored in branches: We\u2019ll hear",
    "our gardener\u2019s voice, the way we did",
    "as children, clear under trees he\u2019d planted:",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s true, my death, at the mosque entrance,",
    "in the massacre, when the Call to Prayer",
    "opened the floodgates\u201d\u2014Quick, follow the silence\u2014",
    "\u201cand dawn rushed into everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d",
    "Will we follow the horned lark, pry",
    "open the back gate into the poplar groves,",
    "go past the search post into the cemetery,",
    "the dust still uneasy on hurried graves",
    "with no names, like all new ones in the city?",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s true\u201d (we\u2019ll hear our gardener",
    "again). \u201cThat bird is silent all winter.",
    "Its voice returns in spring, a plaintive cry.",
    "That\u2019s when it saw the mountain falcon",
    "rip open, in mid-air, the blue magpie,",
    "then carry it, limp from the talons.\u201d",
    "Pluck the blood: My words will echo thus",
    "at sunset, by the ivy, but to what purpose?",
    "In the drawer of the cedar stand,",
    "white in the verandah, we\u2019ll find letters:",
    "When the post offices died, the mailman",
    "knew we\u2019d return to answer them. Better",
    "if he\u2019d let them speed to death,",
    "blacked out by Autumn\u2019s Press Trust",
    "not like this, taking away our breath,",
    "holding it with love\u2019s anonymous",
    "scripts: \u201cSee how your world has cracked.",
    "Why aren\u2019t you here? Where are you? Come back.",
    "Is history deaf there, across the oceans?\u201d",
    "Quick, the bird will say. And we\u2019ll try",
    "the keys, with the first one open the door",
    "into the drawing room. Mirror after mirror,",
    "textiled by dust, will blind us to our return",
    "as we light oil lamps. The glass map of our country,",
    "still on the wall, will tear us to lace\u2014",
    "We\u2019ll go past our ancestors, up the staircase,",
    "holding their wills against our hearts. Their wish",
    "was we return\u2014forever!\u2014and inherit(Quick, the bird",
    "will say) that to which we belong, not like this\u2014",
    "to get news of our death after the world\u2019s.",

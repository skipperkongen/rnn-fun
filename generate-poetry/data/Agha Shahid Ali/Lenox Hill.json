    "The Hun so loved the cry, one falling elephant\u2019s,",
    "he wished to hear it again. At dawn, my mother",
    "heard, in her hospital-dream of elephants,",
    "sirens wail through Manhattan like elephants",
    "forced off Pir Panjal\u2019s rock cliffs in Kashmir:",
    "the soldiers, so ruled, had rushed the elephant,",
    ",",
    "said the Buddha. But not lifted from the universe,",
    "those prints vanished forever into the universe,",
    "though nomads still break news of those elephants",
    "as if it were just yesterday the air spread the dye",
    "(\u201cWar\u2019s annals will fade into night / Ere their story die\u201d),",
    "the punishing khaki whereby the world sees us die",
    "out, mourning you, O massacred elephants!",
    "Months later, in Amherst, she dreamt: She was, with dia-",
    "monds, being stoned to death. I prayed: If she must die,",
    "let it only be some dream. But there were times, Mother,",
    "while you slept, that I prayed, \"Saints, let her die.\"",
    "Not, I swear by you, that I wished you to die",
    "but to save you as you were, young, in song in Kashmir,",
    "and I, one festival, crowned Krishna by you, Kashmir",
    "listening to my flute. You never let gods die.",
    "Thus I swear, here and now, not to forgive the universe",
    "that would let me get used to a universe",
    "without you. She, she alone, was the universe",
    "as she earned, like a galaxy, her right not to die,",
    "defying the Merciful of the Universe,",
    "Master of Disease, \u201cin the circle of her traverse\u201d",
    "of drug-bound time. And where was the god of elephants,",
    "plump with Fate, when tusk to tusk, the universe,",
    "dyed green, became ivory? Then let the universe,",
    "like Paradise, be considered a tomb. Mother,",
    "they asked me,",
    "? I answered",
    ". What did they expect? For no verse",
    "sufficed except the promise, fading, of Kashmir",
    "and the cries that reached you from the cliffs of Kashmir",
    "(across fifteen centuries) in the hospital.",

    "How her breathing drowns out the universe",

    "story: his return (in a country far from Kashmir)",
    "to the jungle where each year, on the day his mother",
    "died, he touches with his trunk the bones of his mother.",

    "she tells me. I imagine her: a bride in Kashmir,",

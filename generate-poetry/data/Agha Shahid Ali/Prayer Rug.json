    "Those intervals",
    "between the day\u2019s",
    "five calls to prayer",
    "the women of the house",
    "pulling thick threads",
    "through vegetables",
    "rosaries of ginger",
    "of rustling peppers",
    "in autumn drying for winter",
    "in those intervals this rug",
    "part of Grandma\u2019s dowry",
    "folded",
    "so the Devil\u2019s shadow",
    "would not desecrate",
    "Mecca scarlet-woven",
    "with minarets of gold",
    "but then the sunset",
    "call to prayer",
    "the servants",
    "their straw mats unrolled",
    "praying or in the garden",
    "in summer on grass",
    "the children wanting",
    "the prayers to end",
    "the women\u2019s foreheads",
    "touching Abraham\u2019s",
    "silk stone of sacrifice",
    "black stone descended",
    "from Heaven",
    "the pilgrims in white circling it",
    "this year my grandmother",
    "also a pilgrim",
    "in Mecca she weeps",
    "as the stone is unveiled",
    "she weeps holding on",
    "to the pillars",
    "(for Begum Zafar Ali)"

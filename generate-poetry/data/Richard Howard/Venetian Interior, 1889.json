    "Stand to one side. No, over here with me:",
    "out of the light but out of darkness too,",
    "where everything that is not odd or old",
    "is gold and subjugates the shadows. There,",
    "now you will be no trouble and behold none\u2014",
    "anything",
    "trouble, at first glance,",
    "last chance to see what I say is worth a look.",
    "This whole palazzo is the property",
    "of a middle-aged and penniless dilettante,",
    "Pen Browning (Robert\u2019s son), who has made terms",
    "\u2014palatial terms, in fact\u2014with towering",
    "premises afforded by the tact",
    "of his New York heiress, Fannie Coddington",
    "Browning, dutiful daughter-in-law, doubtful wife.",
    "Yet who would not be full of doubts, perplexed",
    "at having to define Pen\u2019s talents and finance",
    "his tastes? Their Ca\u2019 Rezzonico itself",
    "is dubious. The ripened fruit of centuries,",
    "rat- and roach-infested, peeling, rank,",
    "withers with each tide that rots the piles,",
    "though apt withal to weather these tenants as well ...",
    "He is painting from the model:",
    "undressed of course but draped against the draft",
    "in a looping swathe of silver-printed stuff",
    "that seems to move, glistening over flesh\u2014",
    "it",
    "move! lapped in its silver mesh are coils",
    "of a python wrapped in loving torpor round",
    "the",
    "\u2019s undistracted torso.",
    "The afternoon is numb: Dryope sleeps",
    "in her pose, the python slips a little",
    "down the umber slope of her thigh, and Pen,",
    "spired, slaps a dashing curlicue",
    "across his canvas. \u201cI had the Jew come by",
    "with this brocaded velvet yesterday\u2014",
    "I bargained some old clothes against it, Fan,",
    "so you needn\u2019t ask how much it cost in dollars.\u201d",
    "To whom does Pen speak, his eyes intent, his hands",
    "\u201cworking busily\u201d? Beyond his \u201csubject,\u201d look",
    "past the unimposing",
    "look through",
    "the tufts of pampas grass extending up",
    "to the tufa vault whose patination casts",
    "a pall of watery splendor on the scene\u2014",
    "if you manage to overlook the sumptuous junk,",
    "jasper urns, a suit of Japanese armor,",
    "stuffed bears, on the divan bearskins too\u2014",
    "or in this atmosphere let me say",
    "on that very divan Robert Browning lolls,",
    "a short and foreshortened colossus with feet of clay",
    "but the hardest imaginable cranium, among",
    "his son\u2019s possessions slightly ill at ease",
    "though well bestowed on slippery pelts, and plays",
    "(against the wealthy Fannie\u2014see her white shawl?)",
    "at draughts with agate pieces, red and green,",
    "like a page from some old parchment of kings and queens.",
    "In approbation of his son\u2019s economies",
    "the old man smiles now\u2014but does she? The skull",
    "interfering with our view of Fannie is,",
    "I believe, or was the Mahdi\u2019s which Pen keeps",
    "beside his easel (Victorians could make",
    "anything into a tobacco jar). \u201cI took",
    "my pipe through Cannareggio on a long tramp",
    "yesterday morning, right into the Ghetto,",
    "looking for likely faces, which I found!",
    "Didn\u2019t you say, Father, a satisfactory Jew",
    "is worth a dozen Gentiles? The one who sold",
    "that velvet to me is sure to be ready by Spring:",
    "for",
    "you know, or",
    "at least ...\u201d",
    "Pen chatters on to charm the python, not",
    "Dryope or Fannie who look up",
    "only when the poet, roused, exclaims\u2014",
    "as rapt before himself as a child in front",
    "of the Christmas tree: \u201cA satisfactory Jew!",
    "Setting mere Rothschildsplay aside, Pen,",
    "I never saw but one in all my life:",
    "Dizzy, I mean\u2014the potent wizard himself,",
    "at Hampton Court a dozen years ago,",
    "murmuring at the Queen\u2019s ear like a wasp",
    "who hoped to buzz his way into the diamonds ...",
    "With that olive cast and those glowing-coal-black eyes",
    "and the mighty dome of his forehead (to be sure,",
    "no Christian temple), as unlike a living man",
    "as any waxwork at Madame Tussaud\u2019s:",
    "he had a face more mocking than a domino\u2014",
    "I would as soon have thought of sitting down",
    "to tea with Hamlet or Ahasuerus ...\u201d",
    "As if on cue, the poet\u2019s high voice fades,",
    "the lights on his tree go out. Yet we have seen",
    "enough and heard enough: the secret of losing",
    "listeners\u2014did Browning never learn?\u2014",
    "is to tell them everything. We lose details.",
    "The Mahdi\u2019s skull and Fannie\u2019s coincide ...",
    "The scene blurs and the sounds become no more",
    "than exaggerated silence. Stand with me",
    "another moment till our presence is",
    "sacrificed to transitions altogether.",
    "Time will not console\u2014at best it orders",
    "into a kind of seasonable chaos.",
    "Let me tell you, it will not take much",
    "longer than a medical prescription\u2014",
    "give you ingredients, no cure ...",
    "Visitors to the palazzo used to speak",
    "of the dangerous m\u00e9nage\u2014the menagerie!",
    "yet the Costa Rican python that cost Pen",
    "(or Fannie) sixteen pounds was the first to go,",
    "untempted by the rats of Rezzonico;",
    "followed Dryope underground,",
    "the girl carried off by a chill and buried",
    "at San Michele, the great daub interred",
    "in the cellars of the Metropolitan ...",
    "\u201cDear dead women, with such hair, too,\u201d",
    "we quote, and notice that hair is the first",
    "of ourselves to decay before\u2014last after\u2014death.",
    "In a year Robert Browning too was dead, immortal;",
    "in another, Fannie dropped her shawl and took",
    "the veil and vows of an Episcopalian nun;",
    "and Pen? Oh, Pen went on painting, of course\u2014",
    "in yellow chamois gloves,",
    "obese, oblivious, dithering into debt",
    "and an easy death. The sale of what we saw",
    "or saw through in Venice",
    "as they say,",
    "some thirty thousand pounds at Sotheby\u2019s.",
    "I told you: first glance is last chance.",
    "Darkness slides over the waters\u2014oil sludge",
    "spreading under, till even Venice dies,",
    "immortally immerded. Earth has no other way,",
    "our provisional earth, than to become",
    "invisible in us and rise again.",
    "Rezzonico ... Disraeli ... We realize our task.",
    "It is to print earth so deep in memory",
    "that a meaning reaches the surface. Nothing but",
    "darkness abides, darkness demanding not",
    "illumination\u2014not from the likes of us\u2014",
    "but only that we yield. And we yield."

    "Alas, my Purse! how lean and low!",
    "My silken Purse! what art thou now!",
    "One I beheld\u2014but stocks will fall\u2014",
    "When both thy ends had wherewithal.",
    "When I within thy slender fence",
    "My fortune placed, and confidence;",
    "A poet\u2019s fortune!\u2014not immense:",
    "Yet, mixed with keys, and coins among,",
    "Chinked to the melody of song.",
    "Canst thou forget, when, high in air,",
    "I saw thee fluttering at a fair?",
    "And took thee, destined to be sold,",
    "My lawful Purse, to have and hold?",
    "Yet used so oft to disembogue,",
    "No prudence could thy fate prorogue.",
    "Like wax thy silver melted down,",
    "Touch but the brass, and lo! \u2019twas gone:",
    "And gold would never with thee stay,",
    "For gold had wings, and flew away.",
    "Alas, my Purse! yet still be proud,",
    "For see the Virtues round thee crowd!",
    "See, in the room of paltry wealth,",
    "Calm Temperance rise, the nurse of health;",
    "And Self-Denial, slim and spare,",
    "And Fortitude, with look severe;",
    "And Abstinence, to leanness prone,",
    "And Patience, worn to skin and bone:",
    "Prudence and Foresight on thee wait,",
    "And Poverty lies here in state!",
    "Hopeless her spirits to recruit,",
    "For every Virtue is a mute.",
    "Well then, my Purse, thy Sabbaths keep;",
    "Now thou art empty, I shall sleep.",
    "No silver sounds shall thee molest,",
    "Nor golden dreams disturb my breast.",
    "Safe shall I walk with thee along,",
    "Amidst temptations thick and strong;",
    "Catched by the eye, no more shall stop",
    "At Wildey\u2019s toys, or Pinchbeck\u2019s shop;",
    "Nor cheapening Payne\u2019s ungodly books,",
    "Be drawn aside by pastry-cooks:",
    "But fearless now we both may go",
    "Where Ludgate\u2019s mercers bow so low;",
    "Beholding all with equal eye,",
    "Nor moved at\u2014\u201cMadam, what d\u2019ye buy?\u201d",
    "Away, far hence each worldly care!",
    "Nor dun nor pick-purse shalt thou fear,",
    "Nor flatterer base annoy my ear.",
    "Snug shalt thou travel through the mob,",
    "For who a poet\u2019s purse will rob?",
    "And softly sweet in garret high",
    "Will I thy virtues magnify;",
    "Outsoaring flatterers\u2019 stinking breath,",
    "And gently rhyming rats to death."

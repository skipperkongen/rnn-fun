    "Another dead mare waits",
    "in the shoals of some body",
    "of water, waits to be burden,",
    "borne into a foaming ocean,",
    "where it might become food",
    "for whales, or, simply empty",
    "signifier\u2014hair latched to the sea\u2019s undulation",
    "like Absalom\u2019s beauty",
    "caught in the playful branches",
    "of a tree desiring union,",
    "entanglement, thick confusion\u2014",
    "but not this mare;",
    "she does not get the luxury",
    "of a lyric\u2014a song that makes our own undoing",
    "or killing sweet even as we go down",
    "into the fire to rise as smoke.",
    "This horse must lie, eyes open,",
    "amongst the stones and fresh water",
    "crawfish in Money, Mississippi,",
    "listen to the men\u2019s boots break the water",
    "as they drop a black boy\u2019s body near her head,",
    "pick him up, only to let him fall again",
    "there: bent and eye-to-eye with her",
    "as though decaying is something",
    "that requires a witness",
    "\u2014as though the mare might say:",
    "the boy\u2019s neck finally snapped",
    "from the weight of the mill fan;",
    "he never looked at me again.",
    "Or the boy might say:",
    ". They part",
    "here\u2014the boy\u2019s body found",
    "in another man\u2019s arms, carried back",
    "to town, as the horse says nothing",
    "because horses don\u2019t speak, besides",
    "this one\u2019s dead."

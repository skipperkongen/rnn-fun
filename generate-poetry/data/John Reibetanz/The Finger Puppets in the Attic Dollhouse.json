    "If they, more petite",

    "have pillaged their robes\u2019 sparkled trim,",
    "stood tiptoe",
    "on the plumped felt tops",
    "of their thimble-sized footstools",
    "to scrutinize",
    "the worn fabric",
    "of this room\u2019s blue distances,",
    "would they locate",
    "the source of lightning bolts",
    "in our faces\u2019 wrinkled pleats",
    "and construe the stars\u2019",
    "dance from the tattered",
    "embroidery of our steps,",
    "or find in our seamless",
    "unravelling years",
    "the tissue of apocalypse?"

    "\u2018Are you asleep?\u2019",
    "Like a door that always opens",
    "on the same empty closet,",
    "the old jokey question",
    "you can never answer \u2018yes\u2019 to",
    "is a snap, in comparison",
    "to \u2018Where are you?\u2019",
    "Moving, wherever you are.",
    "Even your stillness on the back seat takes",
    "the bent of action, a kicking reach",
    "through swells and drifts of afghan.",
    "My live question mark,",
    "are they salt or sweet, the waters",
    "you riddle?",
    "Asking gets me as far",
    "as ladling water with a net.",
    "Though I can catch your small",
    "beached foot, and hear",
    "soft waves of breath, the mesh",
    "of senses isn\u2019t fine enough",
    "to land you now.",
    "When you come back,",
    "you\u2019ll rub the sand from your eyes",
    "and know nothing of where you\u2019ve been.",
    "Love is like that: the element",
    "we breathe and move through,",
    "untouchable and always",
    "there."

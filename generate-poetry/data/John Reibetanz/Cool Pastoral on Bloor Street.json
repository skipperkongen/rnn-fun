    "Consider the tragic fortitude",
    "of mannikins, the courage it takes",
    "under casual poses to do",
    "nothing interminably each day.",
    "To face unflinching (through sunlit glass",
    "that bars them from it) the rushing surf",
    "of life within reach where they must stand",
    "marooned on their islands\u2019 plastic turf,",
    "and not to cry out: more heroic",
    "than those Romans the lava rain stunned",
    "to statues\u2014misshaped by the panic",
    "that twisted their limbs, glazed with their pain",
    "in black rock\u2014friezes of agony.",
    "You would never know, from the relaxed",
    "swivel of this woman\u2019s wrist as she",
    "completes a backhand with her racket,",
    "that she will never take another",
    "swing, or from her smile that she has stood",
    "balanced here on one foot all summer",
    "like one of Dante\u2019s damned, and not cracked.",
    "\u2018Cracked\u2019 is my father\u2019s word for \u2018crazy,\u2019",
    "as in \u2018You\u2019d have to be cracked to pay",
    "that much for a pair of shoes.\u2019 He\u2019s not",
    "crazy, but he forgets, and today",
    "as we pay out his visit\u2019s hours",
    "strolling on Bloor, he thinks up the same",
    "questions again minutes after he\u2019s",
    "nodded and smiled at answers to them.",
    "Looking for things to look at and not",
    "think, I focus on another grove",
    "of mummers: headless, their necks poke out",
    "like worms from the smartly turned-over",
    "collars of turtlenecks and jackets.",
    "You can tell they\u2019ve also lost their arms",
    "from the way the sleeves plummet slackly",
    "off their shoulders\u2014although they, ashamed",
    "to show the mutilation, act cool",
    "and tuck the cuffs into their pockets.",
    "I look at my father\u2014hands trembling,",
    "head crazed like china with minute cracks",
    "through which years exit invisibly\u2014",
    "and must remind myself his show is",
    "kinder, the long-running comedy",
    "where he\u2019s played every part, from fresh-faced",
    "mooning lover to child-duped parent",
    "to doddering senex: still free now",
    "(while heart and limbs play their duet)",
    "to do a walk-on, ad lib, bow out.",
    "He sweats a little in the sunshine.",
    "Summer stock, lacking the tragic poise",
    "that freezes these actors in their scene,",
    "we move on towards a shadier place."

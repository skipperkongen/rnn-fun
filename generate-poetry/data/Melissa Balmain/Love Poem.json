    "The afternoon we left our first apartment,",
    "we scrubbed it down from ceiling to parquet.",
    "Who knew the place could smell like lemon muffins?",
    "It suddenly seemed nuts to move away.",
    "The morning someone bought our station wagon,",
    "it gleamed with wax and every piston purred.",
    "That car looked like a centerfold in",
    "Too late, we saw that selling was absurd.",
    "And then there was the freshly tuned piano",
    "we passed along to neighbors with a wince.",
    "We told ourselves we\u2019d find one even better;",
    "instead we\u2019ve missed its timbre ever since.",
    "So if, God help us, we are ever tempted",
    "to ditch our marriage when it\u2019s lost its glow,",
    "let\u2019s give the thing our finest spit and polish\u2014",
    "and, having learned our lesson, not let go."

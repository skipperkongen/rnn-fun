    "Their long skirts and high heels battled away:",
    "Depending on the ground\u2019s and breezes\u2019 whim,",
    "At times some stocking shone, low on the limb\u2014",
    "Too soon concealed!\u2014tickling our na\u00efvet\u00e9.",
    "At times, as well, an envious bug would bite",
    "Our lovelies\u2019 necks beneath the boughs, and we",
    "Would glimpse a flash\u2014white flash, ah! ecstasy!\u2014",
    "And glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight.",
    "Evening would fall, the autumn day would draw",
    "To its uncertain close: our belles would cling",
    "Dreamingly to us, cooing, whispering",
    "Lies that still set our souls trembling with awe."

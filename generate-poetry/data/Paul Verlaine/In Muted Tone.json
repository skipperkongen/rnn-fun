    "Gently, let us steep our love",
    "In the silence deep, as thus,",
    "Branches arching high above",
    "Twine their shadows over us.",
    "Let us blend our souls as one,",
    "Hearts\u2019 and senses\u2019 ecstasies,",
    "Evergreen, in unison",
    "With the pines\u2019 vague lethargies.",
    "Dim your eyes and, heart at rest,",
    "Freed from all futile endeavor,",
    "Arms crossed on your slumbering breast,",
    "Banish vain desire forever.",
    "Let us yield then, you and I,",
    "To the waftings, calm and sweet,",
    "As their breeze-blown lullaby",
    "Sways the gold grass at your feet.",
    "And, when night begins to fall",
    "From the black oaks, darkening,",
    "In the nightingale\u2019s soft call",
    "Our despair will, solemn, sing."

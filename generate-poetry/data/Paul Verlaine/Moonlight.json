    "Your soul is like a landscape fantasy,",
    "Where masks and Bergamasks, in charming wise,",
    "Strum lutes and dance, just a bit sad to be",
    "Hidden beneath their fanciful disguise.",
    "Singing in minor mode of life\u2019s largesse",
    "And all-victorious love, they yet seem quite",
    "Reluctant to believe their happiness,",
    "And their song mingles with the pale moonlight,",
    "The calm, pale moonlight, whose sad beauty, beaming,",
    "Sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees,",
    "And makes the marbled fountains, gushing, streaming\u2014",
    "Slender jet-fountains\u2014sob their ecstasies."

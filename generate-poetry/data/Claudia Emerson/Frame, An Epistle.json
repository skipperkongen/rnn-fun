    "Most of the things you made for me\u2014blanket-",
    "chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker\u2014I gave",

    "be reminded of the hours lost there,",

    "the tedious finishes. But I did keep",
    "the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors,",
    "most of these years it has been invisible,",
    "part of the wall, or defined by reflection\u2014",
    "safe\u2014because reflection, after all, does change.",
    "I hung it here in the front, dark hallway",
    "of this house you will never see, so that",
    "it might magnify the meager light,",
    "become a lesser, backward window. No one",
    "pauses long before it. But this morning,",
    "as I put on my overcoat, then straightened",
    "my hair, I saw outside my face its frame",
    "you made for me, admiring for the first",
    "time the way the cherry you cut and planed",
    "yourself had darkened, just as you said it would."

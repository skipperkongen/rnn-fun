    "It was fifty cents a game",
    "beneath exhausted ceiling fans,",
    "the smoke\u2019s old spiral. Hooded lights",
    "burned distant, dull. I was tired, but you",
    "insisted on one more, so I chalked",
    "the cue\u2014the bored blue\u2014broke, scratched.",
    "It was always possible",
    "for you to run the table, leave me",
    "nothing. But I recall the easy",
    "shot you missed, and then the way",
    "we both studied, circling\u2014keeping",
    "what you had left me between us."

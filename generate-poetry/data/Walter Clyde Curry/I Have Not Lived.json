    "Though half my years besiege the aged sun,",
    "I have not lived. My robust preparation",
    "Lags tardily behind fit consummation,",
    "Droops sweatily in courses just begun.",
    "Oh, I have loved and lusted with the best,",
    "Plucked momentary music from the senses;",
    "I\u2019ve kissed a lip or two with fair pretenses",
    "And wept for softness of a woman\u2019s breast.",
    "My mind rebounds to nether joys and pain,",
    "Toying with filth and pharisaic leaven;",
    "I know the lift up sundry peaks to heaven,",
    "And every rockless path to hell again.",
    "I wait the hour when gods have more to give",
    "Than husks and bare insatiate will to live."

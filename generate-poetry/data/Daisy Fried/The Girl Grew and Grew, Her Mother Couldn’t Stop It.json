    "The girl grew and grew, her mother couldn\u2019t stop it; it terrorized.",
    "What would the finger-dance do? Kindergarten art a buffet of markers,",
    "gluings of stuffs to seasonally-keyed paper, Elmer\u2019s pools drying clear.",
    "A stapling and testing of cylinders versus spheres versus cubes",
    "for kinetic and entropic possibilities, stuffing balled newspaper",
    "into paper-bag dragons, two sweet silver elephants with heads too small",
    "and trunks too long, situated off-center, snuffling flowers. And silver rain.",
    "And 16 silver hearts stacked vertically and strips of masking tape, colored",
    "in reverse rainbow. Unnamable tendrils diffusing to scribbles. A bird.",
    "Another bird, more rain, peace signs, a horse with sideways-flowing mane,",
    "and knowledge: that the sky\u2019s full of black-struck",
    "s and",
    "s, drifting",
    "clouds; that her kitty cats watch sunsets; sky doesn\u2019t reach",
    "down to meet the earth; mother shrinks to the size of a penis."

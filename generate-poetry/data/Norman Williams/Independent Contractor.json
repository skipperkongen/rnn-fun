    "Forty degrees; the threat of rain. That time of fall",
    "When we are most inclined to end it all.",
    "Denim-jacketed, with a faded sweatshirt hood,",
    "He draws his plane along a length of wood,",
    "Then takes a chisel to a cornice piece",
    "With two light taps. His movements never cease;",
    "His cracked and callused hands, in gloves with fingers cut,",
    "Rub up for warmth, then start like hares hawked by his thought.",
    "He knows no other work; wants none. He learned this from",
    "His father\u2014brace and auger, bob and plumb\u2014",
    "The same way he learned how to hunt or take a beating:",
    "Not by words but by a look, and by repeating",
    "Mutely each grimace, wince, set of the jaw.",
    "His job is more than workmanlike. No flaw",
    "Or gap offends the eye. Each post and bull-nose stair",
    "Seems proof of love\u2014if love is proved by excess care."

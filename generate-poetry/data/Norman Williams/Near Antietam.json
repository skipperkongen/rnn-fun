    "Shunning the British tourist bus, we walk,",
    "My child and I, the West Woods where, like dogs",
    "Who know their death is due, the wounded took",
    "Themselves to give up hope. The horror begs",
    "Imagining\u2014the soldiers hauling limbs",
    "Hacked off or messmates dead, and everywhere,",
    "Mixed with the summer scent of swelling plums,",
    "A stench of putrid flesh and burning hair.",
    "Here Lee was turned. That night the forest filled",
    "With muttered names of loved ones left, and cries",
    "From mangled soldiers pleading to be killed.",
    "Seeing my distant look, my daughter tries",
    "My sleeve: \u201cWhat is it, what?\u201d she asks, and I",
    "Say \u201cnothing, nothing\u201d\u2014though \u201cnothing\u201d is a lie."

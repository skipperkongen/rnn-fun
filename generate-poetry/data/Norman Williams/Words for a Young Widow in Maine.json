    "The sinew of the hickory that grips",
    "The axe, the rasp of salt against the skin,",
    "Or rockbound earth that shines the steel plough",
    "In spring, are thought along our coast to lend",
    "A native character, though none can match",
    "The force of grief: compare the fisherman\u2019s",
    "Scored cheeks; the ligaments that rope the necks",
    "Of lumberjacks; or the farmer\u2019s gnarled wrist\u2014",
    "Compare these with the widow\u2019s fisted look,",
    "Then judge who has the most to bear. Think of",
    "The ghost that each night slips between her sheets",
    "Or of the sudden joy of being alone",
    "Which troubles her for weeks. And you, who thought",
    "Him mean, or too devoted to his drink,",
    "Consider how the common fingerstones,",
    "Bathed in the tidal slabs, grow luminous."

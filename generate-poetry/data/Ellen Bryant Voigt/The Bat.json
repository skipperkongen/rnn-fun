    "Reading in bed, full of sentiment",
    "for the mild evening and the children",
    "asleep in adjacent rooms, hearing them",
    "cry out now and then the brief reports",
    "of sufficient imagination, and listening",
    "at the same time compassionately",
    "to the scrabble of claws, the fast treble",
    "in the chimney\u2014",
    "then it was out,",
    "not a trapped bird",
    "beating at the seams of the ceiling,",
    "but a bat lifting toward us, falling away.",
    "large brain, a choice of weapons\u2014",
    "Shuddering, in the lit hall",
    "we swung repeatedly against",
    "its rising secular face",
    "until it fell; then",
    "shoveled it into the yard for the cat",
    "who shuttles easily between two worlds."

    "In the still morning when you move",
    "toward me in sleep for love,",
    "I dream of",
    "an island where long-stemmed cranes,",
    "serious weather vanes,",
    "turn slowly on one",
    "foot. There the dragonfly folds",
    "his mica wings and rides",
    "the tall reed",
    "close as a handle. The hippo yawns,",
    "nods to thick pythons,",
    "slack and drowsy, who droop down",
    "like untied sashes",
    "from the trees. The brash",
    "hyenas do not cackle",
    "and run but lie with their paws",
    "on their heads like dogs.",
    "The lazy crow\u2019s caw",
    "falls like a sigh. In the field",
    "below, the fat moles build",
    "their dull passage with an old",
    "instinct that needs",
    "no light or waking; its slow beat",
    "turns the hand in sleep",
    "as we turn toward each other",
    "in the ripe air of summer,",
    "before the change of weather,",
    "before the heavy drop",
    "of the apples."

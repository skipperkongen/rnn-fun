    "The eagle floats and glides,",
    "circling the burnished aspen,",
    "then takes the high pines",
    "with a flash of underwing.",
    "As surely as the eagle sails",
    "toward the bay\u2019s open curve,",
    "as surely as he swoops and seizes",
    "the struggling fish, pulling",
    "it from an osprey\u2019s beak;",
    "so too, autumn descends,",
    "to steal the glistening",
    "summer from our open hands."

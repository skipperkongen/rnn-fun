    "O those years! The green light of morning",
    "and the still unswept pavements of pleasure\u2014",
    "summer yelled from every surface of the city",
    "and supped at a horn",
    "refilled from above.",
    "Silent hour. Watery colors",
    "of a pale green eye\u2019s diluted stream",
    "pictures in that magic green, glass dances,",
    "shepherds and streams, a dome, pigeons\u2014",
    "woven, dispatched, shining, faded\u2014",
    "mutable clouds of happiness!",
    "So you faced the day: the font",
    "without bubbles, dawdling",
    "buildings and staircases; the houses",
    "locked up, it was for you to create",
    "the morning, early jasmine,",
    "its yelps, its incipient aboriginal",
    "stream\u2014still without end\u2014O those years!",
    "Something unquenchable in the heart,",
    "complement to heaven and earth;",
    "playing to you from reeds and gardens,",
    "evening storms",
    "drenched the brassy umbels,",
    "darkly they burst, taut with seeds,",
    "and sea and strands,",
    "wimpled with tents,",
    "full of burning sand,",
    "weeks bronzing, tanning everything",
    "to pelts for kisses landing",
    "indiscriminately like cloudbursts",
    "and soon over!",
    "Even then",
    "a weight overhead",
    "grapes bunching",
    "you pulled down the boughs and let them bounce up,",
    "only a few berries",
    "if you wanted",
    "first\u2014",
    "not yet so bulging and overhung with",
    "plate-sized fruit,",
    "old heavy grape flesh\u2014",
    "O those years!",
    "Dark days of spring,",
    "unyielding murk in the leaves;",
    "drooping lilacs, barely looking up",
    "narcissus color, and smelling strongly of death,",
    "loss of content,",
    "untriumphant sadness of the unfulfilled.",
    "And in the rain",
    "falling on the leaves,",
    "I hear an old forest song,",
    "from forests I crossed",
    "and saw again, but I didn\u2019t return",
    "to the hall where they were singing,",
    "the keys were silent,",
    "the hands were resting somewhere",
    "apart from the arms that held me,",
    "moved me to tears,",
    "hands from the eastern steppes,",
    "long since trampled and bloody\u2014",
    "only the forest song",
    "in the rain",
    "dark days of spring",
    "the everlasting steppes."

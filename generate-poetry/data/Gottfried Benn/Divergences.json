    "One says: please no inner life,",
    "manners by all means, but nothing affective,",

    "those cerebralized",
    "city-Styxes",
    "when my little prince",
    "pokes his chubby little legs through the bars of his cot",
    "it melts my heart, it was like that with Otto Ernst,",
    "and it\u2019s no different now",
    "the contraries are not easy to reconcile",
    "but when you survey the provinces",
    "the inner life",
    "has it by a neck."

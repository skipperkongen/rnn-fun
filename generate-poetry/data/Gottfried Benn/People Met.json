    "I have met people who,",
    "asked after their names,",
    "shyly\u2014as if they had no title",
    "to an appellation all to themselves\u2014",
    "replied \u201cFr\u00e4ulein Christian\u201d and added:",
    "\u201clike the first name,\u201d they wanted to make it easy for the other,",
    "not a difficult name like \u201cPopiol\u201d or \u201cBabendererde\u201d\u2014",
    "\u201clike the first name\u201d\u2014please, don\u2019t burden your memory overmuch!",
    "I have met people who",
    "grew up in a single room with their parents",
    "and four brothers and sisters, and studied at night",
    "with their fingers in their ears at the kitchen table,",
    "and grew up to be beautiful and self-possessed as duchesses\u2014",
    "and innerly gentle and hard-working as Nausicaa,",
    "clear-browed as angels.",
    "I have often asked myself and never found an answer",
    "whence kindness and gentleness come,",
    "I don\u2019t know it to this day, and now must go myself."

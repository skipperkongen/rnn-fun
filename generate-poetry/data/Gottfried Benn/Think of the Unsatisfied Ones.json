    "When despair\u2014",
    "you who enjoyed great triumphs",
    "and walked with confidence and the memory",
    "of many gifts of delirium and dawns",
    "and unexpected",
    "turns\u2014",
    "when despair wants you in its grip,",
    "and threatens you from some unfathomable depth",
    "with destruction",
    "and the guttering out of your flame:",
    "then think of the unsatisfied ones,",
    "with their migraine-prone temples and introverted dispositions,",
    "loyal to a few memories",
    "that held out little hope,",
    "who still bought flowers,",
    "and with a smile of not much luminosity",
    "confided secret desires",
    "to their small-scale heavens",
    "that were soon to be extinguished."

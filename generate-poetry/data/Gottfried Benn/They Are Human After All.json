    "as the waiter steps up to a table",
    "out of sight of you,",
    "reserved, corner table\u2014",
    "they too are thin-skinned and pleasure-seeking,",
    "with their own feelings and their own sufferings.",
    "You\u2019re not so all alone",
    "in your mess, your restlessness, your shakes,",
    "they too will be full of doubt, dither, shilly-shallying,",
    "even if it\u2019s all about making deals,",
    "the universal-human",
    "albeit in its commercial manifestations,",
    "but present there too.",
    "Truly, the grief of hearts is ubiquitous",
    "and unending,",
    "but whether they were ever in love",
    "(outwith the awful wedded bed)",
    "burning, athirst, desert-parched",
    "for the nectar of a faraway",
    "mouth,",
    "sinking, drowning",
    "in the impossibility of a union of souls\u2014",
    "you won\u2019t know, nor can you",
    "ask the waiter,",
    "who\u2019s just ringing up",
    "another bock,",
    "always avid for coupons",
    "to quench a thirst of another nature,",
    "though also deep."

    "That quality of the great boxers",
    "to be able to stand there",
    "and take shots,",
    "gargle with firewater,",
    "encounter intoxication",
    "at sub- and supra-atomic levels,",
    "to leave one\u2019s sandals at the crater\u2019s lip",
    "like Empedocles, and descend,",
    "not say: I\u2019ll be back,",
    "not think: fifty-fifty,",
    "to vacate molehills",
    "when dwarves want space to grow,",
    "to dine alone,",
    "indivisible,",
    "and able to renounce your victory\u2014",
    "a hymn to that man."

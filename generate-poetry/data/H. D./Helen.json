    "All Greece hates",
    "the still eyes in the white face,",

    "All Greece reviles",
    "the wan face when she smiles,",
    "hating it deeper still",

    "and past ills.",
    "Greece sees unmoved,",
    "God\u2019s daughter, born of love,",
    "the beauty of cool feet",
    "and slenderest knees,",
    "could love indeed the maid,",
    "only if she were laid,",
    "white ash amid funereal cypresses."

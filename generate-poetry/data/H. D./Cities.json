    "Can we believe\u2014by an effort",
    "comfort our hearts:",
    "it is not waste all this,",
    "not placed here in disgust,",
    "street after street,",
    "each patterned alike,",
    "no grace to lighten",
    "a single house of the hundred",
    "crowded into one garden-space.",
    "Crowded\u2014can we believe,",
    "not in utter disgust,",
    "in ironical play\u2014",
    "but the maker of cities grew faint",
    "with the beauty of temple",
    "and space before temple,",
    "arch upon perfect arch,",
    "of pillars and corridors that led out",
    "to strange court-yards and porches",
    "where sun-light stamped",
    "hyacinth-shadows",
    "black on the pavement.",
    "That the maker of cities grew faint",
    "with the splendour of palaces,",
    "paused while the incense-flowers",
    "from the incense-trees",
    "dropped on the marble-walk,",
    "thought anew, fashioned this\u2014",
    "street after street alike.",
    "For alas,",
    "he had crowded the city so full",
    "that men could not grasp beauty,",
    "beauty was over them,",
    "through them, about them,",
    "no crevice unpacked with the honey,",
    "rare, measureless.",
    "So he built a new city,",
    "ah can we believe, not ironically",
    "but for new splendour",
    "constructed new people",
    "to lift through slow growth",
    "to a beauty unrivalled yet\u2014",
    "and created new cells,",
    "hideous first, hideous now\u2014",
    "spread larve across them,",
    "not honey but seething life.",
    "And in these dark cells,",
    "packed street after street,",
    "souls live, hideous yet\u2014",
    "O disfigured, defaced,",
    "with no trace of the beauty",
    "men once held so light.",
    "Can we think a few old cells",
    "were left\u2014we are left\u2014",
    "grains of honey,",
    "old dust of stray pollen",
    "dull on our torn wings,",
    "we are left to recall the old streets?",
    "Is our task the less sweet",
    "that the larvae still sleep in their cells?",
    "Or crawl out to attack our frail strength:",
    "You are useless. We live.",
    "We await great events.",
    "We are spread through this earth.",
    "We protect our strong race.",
    "You are useless.",
    "Your cell takes the place",
    "of our young future strength.",
    "Though they sleep or wake to torment",
    "and wish to displace our old cells\u2014",
    "thin rare gold\u2014",
    "that their larve grow fat\u2014",
    "is our task the less sweet?",
    "Though we wander about,",
    "find no honey of flowers in this waste,",
    "is our task the less sweet\u2014",
    "who recall the old splendour,",
    "await the new beauty of cities?"

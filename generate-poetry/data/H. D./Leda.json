    "Where the slow river",
    "meets the tide,",
    "a red swan lifts red wings",
    "and darker beak,",
    "and underneath the purple down",
    "of his soft breast",
    "uncurls his coral feet.",
    "Through the deep purple",
    "of the dying heat",
    "of sun and mist,",
    "the level ray of sun-beam",
    "has caressed",
    "the lily with dark breast,",
    "and flecked with richer gold",
    "its golden crest.",
    "Where the slow lifting",
    "of the tide,",
    "floats into the river",
    "and slowly drifts",
    "among the reeds,",
    "and lifts the yellow flags,",
    "he floats",
    "where tide and river meet.",
    "Ah kingly kiss\u2014",
    "no more regret",
    "nor old deep memories",
    "to mar the bliss;",
    "where the low sedge is thick,",
    "the gold day-lily",
    "outspreads and rests",
    "beneath soft fluttering",
    "of red swan wings",
    "and the warm quivering",
    "of the red swan's breast."

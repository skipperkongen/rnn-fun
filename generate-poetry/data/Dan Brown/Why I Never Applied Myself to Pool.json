    "Not that I lacked an eye entirely,",
    "But give me an oblique enough kiss",
    "To visualize, and my eye said \u201cSee ya later.\u201d",
    "A little practice might have sharpened it,",
    "But what was needed here was not as much",
    "A sharper as a higher order eye,",
    "A whole other orb altogether."

    "The week in August you come home,",
    "adult, professional, aloof,",
    "we roast and carve the fatted calf",
    "\u2014in our case home-grown pig, the chine",
    "garlicked and crisped, the applesauce",
    "hand-pressed. Hand-pressed the greengage wine.",
    "Nothing is cost-effective here.",
    "The peas, the beets, the lettuces",
    "hand sown, are raised to stand apart.",
    "The electric fence ticks like the slow heart",
    "of something we fed and bedded for a year,",
    "then killed with kindness\u2019s one bullet",
    "and paid Jake Mott to do the butchering.",
    "In winter we lure the birds with suet,",
    "thaw lungs and kidneys for the cat.",
    "Darlings, it\u2019s all a circle from the ring",
    "of wire that keeps the raccoons from the corn",
    "to the gouged pine table that we lounge around,",
    "distressed before any of you was born.",
    "Benign and dozy from our gluttonies,",
    "the candles down to stubs, defenses down,",
    "love leaking out unguarded the way",
    "juice dribbles from the fence when grounded",
    "by grass stalks or a forgotten hoe,",
    "how eloquent, how beautiful you seem!",
    "Wearing our gestures, how wise you grow,",
    "ballooning to overfill our space,",
    "the almost-parents of your parents now.",
    "So briefly having you back to measure us",
    "is harder than having let you go."

    "The roasting alive of rabbis",
    "in the ardor of the Crusades",
    "went unremarked in",
    "the Holy Roman Empire to 1918,",
    "open without prerequisite",
    "when I was an undergraduate.",
    "While reciting the Sh\u2019ma in full",
    "expectation that their souls",
    "would waft up to the bosom",
    "of the Almighty the rabbis burned,",
    "pious past the humming extremes",
    "of pain. And their loved ones with them.",
    "Whole communities tortured and set aflame",
    "in Christ\u2019s name",
    "while chanting Hear, O Israel.",
    "Why?",
    "Why couldn\u2019t the rabbis recant,",
    "kiss the Cross, pretend?",
    "Is God so simple that He can\u2019t",
    "sort out real from sham?",
    "Did He want",
    "these fanatic autos-da-f\u00e9, admire",
    "the eyeballs popping,",
    "the corpses shrinking in the fire?",
    "We live in an orderly",
    "universe of discoverable laws,",
    "writes an intelligent alumna",

    "Bliss is belief,",
    "agnostics always say",
    "a little condescendingly",
    "as befits mandarins who function",
    "on a higher moral plane.",
    "Consider our contemporary",
    "Muslim kamikazes",
    "hurling their explosives-",
    "packed trucks through barriers.",
    "Isn\u2019t it all the same?",
    "They too die cherishing the fond",
    "certitude of a better life beyond.",
    "We walk away from twenty-two",
    "graphic centuries of kill-the-jew",
    "and hail, of all things, a Mercedes",
    "taxi. The driver is Yemeni,",
    "loves rock music and hangs",
    "each son\u2019s picture\u2014three so far\u2014",
    "on tassels from his rearview mirror.",
    "I do not tell him that in Yemen",

    "illustrated on the Museum screen.",
    "When his parents came",
    "to the Promised Land, they entered",
    "the belly of an enormous",

    "they would live or die.",
    "No matter. As it was written,",
    "the Messiah had drawn nigh.",
    "I do not ask, who tied",
    "the leaping ram inside the thicket?",
    "Who polished, then blighted the apple?",
    "Who loosed pigs in the Temple,",
    "set tribe against tribe",
    "and nailed man in His pocket?",
    "But ask myself, what would",
    "I die for and reciting what?",
    "Not for Yahweh, Allah, Christ,",
    "those patriarchal fists",
    "in the face. But would",
    "I die to save a child?",
    "Rescue my lover? Would",
    "I run into the fiery barn",
    "to release animals,",
    "singed and panicked, from their stalls?",
    "Bliss is belief, but where\u2019s",
    "the higher moral plane I roost on?",
    "This narrow plank given to splinters.",
    "No answers. Only questions."

    "When the wind",
    "turns and asks, in my father\u2019s voice,",
    "I know three things. One:",
    "I\u2019m never finished answering to the dead.",
    "Two: A man is four winds and three fires.",
    "And the four winds are his father\u2019s voice,",
    "his mother\u2019s voice . . .",
    "Or maybe he\u2019s seven winds and ten fires.",
    "And the fires are seeing, hearing, touching,",
    "dreaming, thinking . . .",
    "Or is he the breath of God?",
    "When the wind turns traveler",
    "and asks, in my father\u2019s voice,",
    "I remember three things.",
    "One: A father\u2019s love",
    "is milk and sugar,",
    "two-thirds worry, two-thirds grief, and what\u2019s left over",
    "is trimmed and leavened to make the bread",
    "the dead and the living share.",
    "And patience? That\u2019s to endure",
    "the terrible leavening and kneading.",
    "And wisdom? That\u2019s my father\u2019s face in sleep.",
    "When the wind",
    "asks,",
    "I know it\u2019s only me",
    "reminding myself",
    "a flower is one station between",
    "earth\u2019s wish and earth\u2019s rapture, and blood",
    "was fire, salt, and breath long before",
    "it quickened any wand or branch, any limb",
    "that woke speaking. It\u2019s just me",
    "in the gowns of the wind,",
    "or my father through me, asking,",
    "asking,",
    "Strange. A troubled father. A happy son.",
    "The wind with a voice. And me talking to no one."

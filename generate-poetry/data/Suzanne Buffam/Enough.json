    "I am wearing dark glasses inside the house",
    "To match my dark mood.",

    "Surely the Greeks had a word for this.",
    "Now surely the Germans do.",
    "The more words a person knows",
    "To describe her private sufferings",
    "The more distantly she can perceive them.",
    "I repeat the names of all the cities I\u2019ve known",
    "And watch an ant drag its crooked shadow home.",
    "What does it mean to love the life we\u2019ve been given?",
    "To act well the part that\u2019s been cast for us?",
    "A train whistles through the far hills.",
    "One day I plan to be riding it."

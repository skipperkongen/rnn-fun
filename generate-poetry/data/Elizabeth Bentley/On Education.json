    "When infant Reason first exerts her sway,",
    "And new-formed thoughts their earliest charms display;",
    "Then let the growing race employ your care",
    "Then guard their opening minds from Folly\u2019s snare;",
    "Correct the rising passions of their youth,",
    "Teach them each serious, each important truth;",
    "Plant heavenly virtue in the tender breast,",
    "Destroy each vice that might its growth molest;",
    "Point out betimes the course they should pursue;",
    "Then with redoubled pleasure shall you view",
    "Their reason strengthen as their years increase,",
    "Their virtue ripen and their follies cease;",
    "Like corn sown early in the fertile soil,",
    "The richest harvest shall repay your toil."

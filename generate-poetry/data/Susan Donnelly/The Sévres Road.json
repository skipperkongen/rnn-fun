    "It might have always been meant",
    "that they walked completely away,",
    "this man on horse, woman with basket.",
    "With their backs to us and the painter,",
    "they are so private. But like those stories",
    "where children step right into a picture",
    "and, looking over their shoulders,",
    "see the consoling frame,",
    "these two would know the way home",
    "like the palms of their hands, the routine",
    "so ordinary it most encloses,",
    "no need for thought, only motion",
    "and the full sensation of sun",
    "on your flesh, along the usual road."

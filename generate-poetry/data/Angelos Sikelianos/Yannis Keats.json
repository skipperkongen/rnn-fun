    "You\u2019d meet me on the broad and shining shore",
    "Of Pylos, so I\u2019d planned,",
    "With Mentor\u2019s tall ship pulled up on the beach",
    "Snug in the sand.",
    "We would be bound, as those who sailed with the gods,",
    "In the winged friendship of youth,",
    "And would take our seats in the stone thrones that Time",
    "And custom had made smooth",
    "And meet that man who still in the third generation",
    "Reigned serene, a sage",
    "Whose tales of travels and holy decrees had ripened",
    "In his mind with age\u2014",
    "At dawn, we\u2019d attend the sacrifice to the gods,",
    "The ritual slaughters",
    "Of the three-year-old heifers, and hear the single cry",
    "That rose from his three daughters",
    "When the axe thwacked, and the black-fringed, slow-rolling eye",
    "Drowned in a swoon",
    "Of darkness, and the gilt horns were rendered idle,",
    "A hazy half moon.",
    "My love imagined you, as a sister her brother,",
    "In your virginal bath,",
    "How Polycaste rinsed your naked body and dressed you",
    "In a robe of fine cloth.",
    "I thought to prod you a little with my foot",
    "As dawn was about to break:",
    "No time to lose! Awake!",
    "And to spend all day in the talk that comes and goes,",
    "Or silence, when no one spoke,",
    "While we drove the horses who were always leaning one way",
    "Or another against the yoke,",
    "But most of all I wanted to see your eyes,",
    "Your deer-like eyes, behold",
    "The palace of Menelaus, and forget themselves",
    "In bronze and the gleam of gold,",
    "Unwavering gaze, sinking the sight so deep,",
    "You\u2019d never remember",
    "The figured silver, the ivory, gilded or white,",
    "The heavy amber,",
    "And I thought that I would say in a hushed voice",
    "Leaning close to your ear,",

    "\u2022",
    "So brightly I saw you; but what grassy roads",
    "Have led me to your tomb!",
    "And the blazing roses with which I strew your grave",
    "And make all Rome abloom,",
    "Light the way unto your golden songs",
    "As though they were the brave,",
    "Armed bodies that turn to dust before one\u2019s eyes",
    "In an ancient, new-breached grave,",
    "And all the worthy treasure of Mycenae,",
    "The golden plunder",
    "I thought to lay before you\u2014goblet, sword,",
    "And diadem\u2014past wonder,",
    "A mask on your dead beauty like the mask",
    "That covered the face",
    "Of the king of the Achaeans\u2014all gold, all artifice,",
    "Hammered upon Death\u2019s trace."

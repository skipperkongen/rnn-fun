    "Our oneness is the wrestlers\u2019, fierce and close,",

    "For soul with soul does battle evermore",
    "Till love be trust.",

    "Each is but each;",
    "Never the very hidden spirit of thee",
    "My life doth reach;",

    "Kisses and speech.",
    "Ah! wrestle closelier! we draw nearer so",
    "Than any bliss",
    "Can bring twain souls who would be whole and one,",
    "Too near to kiss:",
    "To be one thought, one voice before we die,\u2014",
    "Wrestle for this."

    "As Ann came in one summer\u2019s day,",
    "She felt that she must creep,",
    "So silent was the clear cool house,",
    "It seemed a house of sleep.",
    "And sure, when she pushed open the door,",
    "Rapt in the stillness there,",
    "Her mother sat, with stooping head,",
    "Asleep upon a chair;",
    "Fast\u2014fast asleep; her two hands laid",
    "Loose-folded on her knee,",
    "So that her small unconscious face",
    "Looked half unreal to be:",
    "So calmly lit with sleep\u2019s pale light",
    "Each feature was; so fair",
    "Her forehead\u2014every trouble was",
    "Smoothed out beneath her hair.",
    "But though her mind in dream now moved,",
    "Still seemed her gaze to rest\u2014",
    "From out beneath her fast-sealed lids,",
    "Above her moving breast\u2014",
    "On Ann; as quite, quite still she stood;",
    "Yet slumber lay so deep",
    "Even her hands upon her lap",
    "Seemed saturate with sleep.",
    "And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread",
    "Stole over her, and then,",
    "On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod,",
    "And tiptoed out again."

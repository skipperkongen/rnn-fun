    "Dark frost was in the air without,",
    "The dusk was still with cold and gloom,",
    "When less than even a shadow came",
    "And stood within the room.",
    "But of the three around the fire,",
    "None turned a questioning head to look,",
    "Still read a clear voice, on and on,",
    "Still stooped they o\u2019er their book.",
    "The children watched their mother\u2019s eyes",
    "Moving on softly line to line;",
    "It seemed to listen too\u2014that shade,",
    "Yet made no outward sign.",
    "The fire-flames crooned a tiny song,",
    "No cold wind stirred the wintry tree;",
    "The children both in Fa\u00ebrie dreamed",
    "Beside their mother\u2019s knee.",
    "And nearer yet that spirit drew",
    "Above that heedless one, intent",
    "Only on what the simple words",
    "Of her small story meant.",
    "No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind,",
    "No memory her bosom stirred,",
    "Nor dreamed she, as she read to two,",
    "\u2019Twas surely three who heard.",
    "Yet when, the story done, she smiled",
    "From face to face, serene and clear,",
    "A love, half dread, sprang up, as she",
    "Leaned close and drew them near."

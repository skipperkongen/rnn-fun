    "See this house, how dark it is",
    "Beneath its vast-boughed trees!",
    "Not one trembling leaflet cries",
    "To that Watcher in the skies\u2014",
    "\u2018Remove, remove thy searching gaze,",
    "Innocent of heaven\u2019s ways,",
    "Brood not, Moon, so wildly bright,",
    "On secrets hidden from sight.\u2019",
    "\u2018Secrets,\u2019 sighs the night-wind,",
    "\u2018Vacancy is all I find;",
    "Every keyhole I have made",
    "Wails a summons, faint and sad,",
    "No voice ever answers me,",
    "Only vacancy.\u2019",
    "\u2018Once, once \u2026 \u2019 the cricket shrills,",
    "And far and near the quiet fills",
    "With its tiny voice, and then",
    "Hush falls again.",
    "Mute shadows creeping slow",
    "Mark how the hours go.",
    "Every stone is mouldering slow.",
    "And the least winds that blow",
    "Some minutest atom shake,",
    "Some fretting ruin make",
    "In roof and walls. How black it is",
    "Beneath these thick boughed trees!"

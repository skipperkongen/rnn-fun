    "Winter is fallen early",
    "On the house of Stare;",
    "Birds in reverberating flocks",
    "Haunt its ancestral box;",
    "Bright are the plenteous berries",
    "In clusters in the air.",
    "Still is the fountain\u2019s music,",
    "The dark pool icy still,",
    "Whereupon a small and sanguine sun",
    "Floats in a mirror on,",
    "Into a West of crimson,",
    "From a South of daffodil.",
    "\u2019Tis strange to see young children",
    "In such a wintry house;",
    "Like rabbits\u2019 on the frozen snow",
    "Their tell-tale footprints go;",
    "Their laughter rings like timbrels",
    "\u2019Neath evening ominous:",
    "Their small and heightened faces",
    "Like wine-red winter buds;",
    "Their frolic bodies gentle as",
    "Flakes in the air that pass,",
    "Frail as the twirling petal",
    "From the briar of the woods.",
    "Above them silence lours,",
    "Still as an arctic sea;",
    "Light fails; night falls; the wintry moon",
    "Glitters; the crocus soon",
    "Will open grey and distracted",
    "On earth\u2019s austerity:",
    "Thick mystery, wild peril,",
    "Law like an iron rod:\u2014",
    "Yet sport they on in Spring\u2019s attire,",
    "Each with his tiny fire",
    "Blown to a core of ardour",
    "By the awful breath of God."

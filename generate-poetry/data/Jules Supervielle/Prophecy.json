    "One day the Earth will be",
    "just a blind space turning,",
    "night confused with day.",
    "Under the vast Andean sky",
    "there\u2019ll be no more mountains,",
    "not a rock or ravine.",
    "Only one balcony will remain",
    "of all the world\u2019s buildings,",
    "and of the human mappa mundi,",
    "limitless sorrow.",
    "In place of the Atlantic Ocean,",
    "a little saltiness in the air,",
    "and a fish, flying and magical",
    "with no knowledge of the sea.",
    "In a car of the 1900s (no road",
    "for its wheels) three girls",
    "of that time, pressing onwards",
    "like ghosts in the fog.",
    "They\u2019ll peer through the door",
    "thinking they\u2019re nearing Paris",
    "when the odor of the sky",
    "grips them by the throat.",
    "Instead of a forest",
    "there\u2019ll be one bird singing,",
    "which nobody will ever place,",
    "or prefer, or even hear.",
    "Except for God, who listening out,",
    "proclaims it a goldfinch."

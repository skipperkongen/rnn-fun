    "I make my tour",
    "of the garden waiting room",
    "where the tall trees",
    "wander among the corpses.",
    "I might go past",
    "the last resting place",
    "of Sir John Soane",
    "in his stone telephone kiosk,",
    "or the wooden bench",
    "where the Beatles sat",
    "on their \u201cMad Day Out\u201d",
    "July 28th, 1968.",
    "The body of J.C. Bach,",
    "\u201cThe English Bach,\u201d",
    "lies somewhere near here,",
    "lost to the Railway in 1865.",
    "A plaque remembers him",
    "as Queen Charlotte\u2019s music tutor,",
    "who collaborated with someone",
    "and died young.",
    "Perhaps Jerry Cruncher got him,",
    "or perhaps he survived",
    "and is strolling with his friend",
    "in the fields beneath.",
    "I drag my feet",
    "through the backsliding seasons",
    "towards a gate in the wall",
    "with its timetable of opening hours.",
    "Needles have the sudden beauty",
    "of a first line.",
    "They\u2019re always new and surprising",
    "as they burst from their paper covering.",
    "They sing as they hit the air.",
    "You catch sight of them",
    "out of the corner of your eye,",
    "glinting softly to themselves",
    "as they contemplate their next move.",
    "What they\u2019re suggesting is inspired,",
    "but a certain sadness",
    "attends their description",
    "of what is going on.",
    "You don\u2019t know whether to look away,",
    "or accept what they\u2019re saying.",
    "If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll feel a pop",
    "as one of them enters your fistula",
    "and a cool feeling of recognition",
    "spreads up through your arm.",
    "Every few minutes someone\u2019s alarm goes off",
    "because of a blood clot",
    "or a sudden fall in pressure,",
    "then the first two notes of Ferde Grof\u00e9\u2019s",
    "\u201cOn the Trail\u201d goes clip-clopping",
    "down the Grand Canyon of the ward.",
    "Now the first two notes of the song",
    "are joined by the same two notes",
    "from a neighboring machine,",
    "then another two, and another,",
    "till the whole hopeless blind herd",
    "is clip-clopping off into the sunset."

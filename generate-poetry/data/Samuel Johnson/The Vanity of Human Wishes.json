    "Let observation with extensive view,",
    "Survey mankind, from China to Peru;",
    "Remark each anxious toil, each eager strife,",
    "And watch the busy scenes of crowded life;",
    "Then say how hope and fear, desire and hate,",
    "O\u2019erspread with snares the clouded maze of fate,",
    "Where wav\u2019ring man, betray\u2019d by vent\u2019rous pride",
    "To tread the dreary paths without a guide,",
    "As treach\u2019rous phantoms in the mist delude,",
    "Shuns fancied ills, or chases airy good.",
    "How rarely reason guides the stubborn choice,",
    "Rules the bold hand, or prompts the suppliant voice,",
    "How nations sink, by darling schemes oppress\u2019d,",
    "When vengeance listens to the fool\u2019s request.",
    "Fate wings with ev\u2019ry wish th\u2019 afflictive dart,",
    "Each gift of nature, and each grace of art,",
    "With fatal heat impetuous courage glows,",
    "With fatal sweetness elocution flows,",
    "Impeachment stops the speaker\u2019s pow\u2019rful breath,",
    "And restless fire precipitates on death.",
    "But scarce observ\u2019d the knowing and the bold,",
    "Fall in the gen\u2019ral massacre of gold;",
    "Wide-wasting pest! that rages unconfin\u2019d,",
    "And crowds with crimes the records of mankind,",
    "For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws,",
    "For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws;",
    "Wealth heap\u2019d on wealth, nor truth nor safety buys,",
    "The dangers gather as the treasures rise.",
    "Let hist\u2019ry tell where rival kings command,",
    "And dubious title shakes the madded land,",
    "When statutes glean the refuse of the sword,",
    "How much more safe the vassal than the lord,",
    "Low sculks the hind beneath the rage of pow\u2019r,",
    "And leaves the wealthy traitor in the Tow\u2019r,",
    "Untouch\u2019d his cottage, and his slumbers sound,",
    "Tho\u2019 confiscation\u2019s vultures hover round.",
    "The needy traveller, serene and gay,",
    "Walks the wild heath, and sings his toil away.",
    "Does envy seize thee? crush th\u2019 upbraiding joy,",
    "Increase his riches and his peace destroy,",
    "New fears in dire vicissitude invade,",
    "The rustling brake alarms, and quiv\u2019ring shade,",
    "Nor light nor darkness bring his pain relief.",
    "One shews the plunder, and one hides the thief.",
    "Yet still one gen\u2019ral cry the skies assails,",
    "And gain and grandeur load the tainted gales,",
    "Few know the toiling statesman\u2019s fear or care,",
    "Th\u2019 insidious rival and the gaping heir.",
    "Once more, Democritus, arise on earth,",
    "With cheerful wisdom and instructive mirth,",
    "See motley life in modern trappings dress\u2019d,",
    "And feed with varied fools th\u2019 eternal jest:",
    "Thou who couldst laugh where want enchain\u2019d caprice,",
    "Toil crush\u2019d conceit, and man was of a piece;",
    "Where wealth unlov\u2019d without a mourner died;",
    "And scarce a sycophant was fed by pride;",
    "Where ne\u2019er was known the form of mock debate,",
    "Or seen a new-made mayor\u2019s unwieldy state;",
    "Where change of fav\u2019rites made no change of laws,",
    "And senates heard before they judg\u2019d a cause;",
    "How wouldst thou shake at Britain\u2019s modish tribe,",
    "Dart the quick taunt, and edge the piercing gibe?",
    "Attentive truth and nature to decry,",
    "And pierce each scene with philosophic eye.",
    "To thee were solemn toys or empty show,",
    "The robes of pleasure and the veils of woe:",
    "All aid the farce, and all thy mirth maintain,",
    "Whose joys are causeless, or whose griefs are vain.",
    "Such was the scorn that fill\u2019d the sage\u2019s mind,",
    "Renew\u2019d at ev\u2019ry glance on humankind;",
    "How just that scorn ere yet thy voice declare,",
    "Search every state, and canvas ev\u2019ry pray\u2019r.",
    "Unnumber\u2019d suppliants crowd Preferment\u2019s gate,",
    "Athirst for wealth, and burning to be great;",
    "Delusive Fortune hears th\u2019 incessant call,",
    "They mount, they shine, evaporate, and fall.",
    "On ev\u2019ry stage the foes of peace attend,",
    "Hate dogs their flight, and insult mocks their end.",
    "Love ends with hope, the sinking statesman\u2019s door",
    "Pours in the morning worshiper no more;",
    "For growing names the weekly scribbler lies,",
    "To growing wealth the dedicator flies,",
    "From every room descends the painted face,",
    "That hung the bright Palladium of the place,",
    "And smok\u2019d in kitchens, or in auctions sold,",
    "To better features yields the frame of gold;",
    "For now no more we trace in ev\u2019ry line",
    "Heroic worth, benevolence divine:",
    "The form distorted justifies the fall,",
    "And detestation rids th\u2019 indignant wall.",
    "...",
    "When first the college rolls receive his name,",
    "The young enthusiast quits his ease for fame;",
    "Through all his veins the fever of renown",
    "Spreads from the strong contagion of the gown;",
    "O\u2019er Bodley\u2019s dome his future labours spread,",
    "And Bacon\u2019s mansion trembles o\u2019er his head.",
    "Are these thy views? proceed, illustrious youth,",
    "And virtue guard thee to the throne of Truth!",
    "Yet should thy soul indulge the gen\u2019rous heat,",
    "Till captive Science yields her last retreat;",
    "Should Reason guide thee with her brightest ray,",
    "And pour on misty Doubt resistless day;",
    "Should no false Kindness lure to loose delight,",
    "Nor Praise relax, nor Difficulty fright;",
    "Should tempting Novelty thy cell refrain,",
    "And Sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain;",
    "Should Beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart,",
    "Nor claim the triumph of a letter\u2019d heart;",
    "Should no disease thy torpid veins invade,",
    "Nor Melancholy\u2019s phantoms haunt thy shade;",
    "Yet hope not life from grief or danger free,",
    "Nor think the doom of man revers\u2019d for thee:",
    "Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,",
    "And pause awhile from letters, to be wise;",
    "There mark what ills the scholar\u2019s life assail,",
    "Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail.",
    "See nations slowly wise, and meanly just,",
    "To buried merit raise the tardy bust.",
    "If dreams yet flatter, once again attend,",
    "Hear Lydiat\u2019s life, and Galileo\u2019s end.",
    "Nor deem, when learning her last prize bestows",
    "The glitt\u2019ring eminence exempt from foes;",
    "See when the vulgar \u2018scape, despis\u2019d or aw\u2019d,",
    "Rebellion\u2019s vengeful talons seize on Laud.",
    "From meaner minds, tho\u2019 smaller fines content",
    "The plunder\u2019d palace or sequester\u2019d rent;",
    "Mark\u2019d out by dangerous parts he meets the shock,",
    "And fatal Learning leads him to the block:",
    "Around his tomb let Art and Genius weep,",
    "But hear his death, ye blockheads, hear and sleep.",
    "...",
    "Enlarge my life with multitude of days,",
    "In health, in sickness, thus the suppliant prays;",
    "Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know,",
    "That life protracted is protracted woe.",
    "Time hovers o\u2019er, impatient to destroy,",
    "And shuts up all the passages of joy:",
    "In vain their gifts the bounteous seasons pour,",
    "The fruit autumnal, and the vernal flow\u2019r,",
    "With listless eyes the dotard views the store,",
    "He views, and wonders that they please no more;",
    "Now pall the tasteless meats, and joyless wines,",
    "And Luxury with sighs her slave resigns.",
    "Approach, ye minstrels, try the soothing strain,",
    "And yield the tuneful lenitives of pain:",
    "No sounds alas would touch th\u2019 impervious ear,",
    "Though dancing mountains witness\u2019d Orpheus near;",
    "Nor lute nor lyre his feeble pow\u2019rs attend,",
    "Nor sweeter music of a virtuous friend,",
    "But everlasting dictates crowd his tongue,",
    "Perversely grave, or positively wrong.",
    "The still returning tale, and ling\u2019ring jest,",
    "Perplex the fawning niece and pamper\u2019d guest,",
    "While growing hopes scarce awe the gath\u2019ring sneer,",
    "And scarce a legacy can bribe to hear;",
    "The watchful guests still hint the last offence,",
    "The daughter\u2019s petulance, the son\u2019s expense,",
    "Improve his heady rage with treach\u2019rous skill,",
    "And mould his passions till they make his will.",
    "Unnumber\u2019d maladies his joints invade,",
    "Lay siege to life and press the dire blockade;",
    "But unextinguish\u2019d Av\u2019rice still remains,",
    "And dreaded losses aggravate his pains;",
    "He turns, with anxious heart and crippled hands,",
    "His bonds of debt, and mortgages of lands;",
    "Or views his coffers with suspicious eyes,",
    "Unlocks his gold, and counts it till he dies.",
    "But grant, the virtues of a temp\u2019rate prime",
    "Bless with an age exempt from scorn or crime;",
    "An age that melts in unperceiv\u2019d decay,",
    "And glides in modest innocence away;",
    "Whose peaceful day Benevolence endears,",
    "Whose night congratulating Conscience cheers;",
    "The gen\u2019ral fav\u2019rite as the gen\u2019ral friend:",
    "Such age there is, and who could wish its end?",
    "Yet ev\u2019n on this her load Misfortune flings,",
    "To press the weary minutes\u2019 flagging wings:",
    "New sorrow rises as the day returns,",
    "A sister sickens, or a daughter mourns.",
    "Now kindred Merit fills the sable bier,",
    "Now lacerated Friendship claims a tear.",
    "Year chases year, decay pursues decay,",
    "Still drops some joy from with\u2019ring life away;",
    "New forms arise, and diff\u2019rent views engage,",
    "Superfluous lags the vet\u2019ran on the stage,",
    "Till pitying Nature signs the last release,",
    "And bids afflicted worth retire to peace.",
    "But few there are whom hours like these await,",
    "Who set unclouded in the gulfs of fate.",
    "From Lydia\u2019s monarch should the search descend,",
    "By Solon caution\u2019d to regard his end,",
    "In life\u2019s last scene what prodigies surprise,",
    "Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise?",
    "From Marlb\u2019rough\u2019s eyes the streams of dotage flow,",
    "And Swift expires a driv\u2019ler and a show.",
    "The teeming mother, anxious for her race,",
    "Begs for each birth the fortune of a face:",
    "Yet Vane could tell what ills from beauty spring;",
    "And Sedley curs\u2019d the form that pleas\u2019d a king.",
    "Ye nymphs of rosy lips and radiant eyes,",
    "Whom Pleasure keeps too busy to be wise,",
    "Whom Joys with soft varieties invite,",
    "By day the frolic, and the dance by night,",
    "Who frown with vanity, who smile with art,",
    "And ask the latest fashion of the heart,",
    "What care, what rules your heedless charms shall save,",
    "Each nymph your rival, and each youth your slave?",
    "Against your fame with fondness hate combines,",
    "The rival batters and the lover mines.",
    "With distant voice neglected Virtue calls,",
    "Less heard and less, the faint remonstrance falls;",
    "Tir\u2019d with contempt, she quits the slipp\u2019ry reign,",
    "And Pride and Prudence take her seat in vain.",
    "In crowd at once, where none the pass defend,",
    "The harmless freedom, and the private friend.",
    "The guardians yield, by force superior plied;",
    "By Int\u2019rest, Prudence; and by Flatt\u2019ry, Pride.",
    "Now Beauty falls betray\u2019d, despis\u2019d, distress\u2019d,",
    "And hissing Infamy proclaims the rest.",
    "Where then shall Hope and Fear their objects find?",
    "Must dull Suspense corrupt the stagnant mind?",
    "Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate,",
    "Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate?",
    "Must no dislike alarm, no wishes rise,",
    "No cries attempt the mercies of the skies?",
    "Enquirer, cease, petitions yet remain,",
    "Which Heav\u2019n may hear, nor deem religion vain.",
    "Still raise for good the supplicating voice,",
    "But leave to Heav\u2019n the measure and the choice.",
    "Safe in his pow\u2019r, whose eyes discern afar",
    "The secret ambush of a specious pray\u2019r.",
    "Implore his aid, in his decisions rest,",
    "Secure whate\u2019er he gives, he gives the best.",
    "Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires,",
    "And strong devotion to the skies aspires,",
    "Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind,",
    "Obedient passions, and a will resign\u2019d;",
    "For love, which scarce collective man can fill;",
    "For patience, sov\u2019reign o\u2019er transmuted ill;",
    "For faith, that panting for a happier seat,",
    "Counts death kind Nature\u2019s signal of retreat:",
    "These goods for man the laws of Heav\u2019n ordain,",
    "These goods he grants, who grants the pow\u2019r to gain;",
    "With these celestial wisdom calms the mind,",
    "And makes the happiness she does not find."

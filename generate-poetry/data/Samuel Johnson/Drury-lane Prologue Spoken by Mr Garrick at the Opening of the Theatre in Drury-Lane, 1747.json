    "When Learning\u2019s triumph o\u2019er her barb\u2019rous foes",
    "First rear\u2019d the stage, immortal Shakespear rose;",
    "Each change of many-colour\u2019d life he drew,",
    "Exhausted worlds, and then imagin\u2019d new:",
    "Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,",
    "And panting Time toil\u2019d after him in vain:",
    "His pow\u2019rful strokes presiding Truth impress\u2019d,",
    "And unresisted Passion storm\u2019d the breast.",
    "Then Jonson came, instructed from the school,",
    "To please in method, and invent by rule;",
    "His studious patience, and laborious art,",
    "By regular approach essay\u2019d the heart;",
    "Cold Approbation gave the ling\u2019ring bays,",
    "For those who durst not censure, scarce could praise.",
    "A mortal born he met the general doom,",
    "But left, like Egypt\u2019s kings, a lasting tomb.",
    "The Wits of Charles found easier ways to fame,",
    "Nor wish\u2019d for Jonson\u2019s art, or Shakespear\u2019s flame,",
    "Themselves they studied, as they felt, they writ,",
    "Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit.",
    "Vice always found a sympathetic friend;",
    "They pleas\u2019d their age, and did not aim to mend.",
    "Yet bards like these aspir\u2019d to lasting praise,",
    "And proudly hop\u2019d to pimp in future days.",
    "Their cause was gen\u2019ral, their supports were strong,",
    "Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long;",
    "Till Shame regain\u2019d the post that Sense betray\u2019d,",
    "And Virtue call\u2019d Oblivion to her aid.",
    "Then crush\u2019d by rules, and weaken\u2019d as refin\u2019d,",
    "For years the pow\u2019r of tragedy declin\u2019d;",
    "From bard, to bard, the frigid caution crept,",
    "Till Declamation roar\u2019d, while Passion slept.",
    "Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread,",
    "Philosophy remain\u2019d, though Nature fled.",
    "But forc\u2019d at length her ancient reign to quit,",
    "She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit:",
    "Exulting Folly hail\u2019d the joyful day,",
    "And pantomime, and song, confirm\u2019d her sway.",
    "But who the coming changes can presage,",
    "And mark the future periods of the stage?\u2014",
    "Perhaps if skill could distant times explore,",
    "New Behns, new Durfoys, yet remain in store.",
    "Perhaps, where Lear has rav\u2019d, and Hamlet died,",
    "On flying cars new sorcerers may ride.",
    "Perhaps, for who can guess th\u2019 effects of chance?",
    "Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance.",
    "Hard is his lot, that here by Fortune plac\u2019d,",
    "Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste;",
    "With ev\u2019ry meteor of caprice must play,",
    "And chase the new-blown bubbles of the day.",
    "Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice,",
    "The stage but echoes back the public voice.",
    "The drama\u2019s laws the drama\u2019s patrons give,",
    "For we that live to please, must please to live.",
    "Then prompt no more the follies you decry,",
    "As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die;",
    "\u2019Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence",
    "Of rescu\u2019d Nature, and reviving Sense;",
    "To chase the charms of Sound, the pomp of Show,",
    "For useful Mirth, and salutary Woe;",
    "Bid scenic Virtue form the rising age,",
    "And Truth diffuse her radiance from the stage."

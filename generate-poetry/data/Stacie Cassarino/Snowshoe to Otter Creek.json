    "I\u2019m mapping this new year\u2019s vanishings:",
    "lover, yellow house, the knowledge of surfaces.",
    "This is not a story of return.",
    "There are times I wish I could erase",
    "the mind\u2019s lucidity, the difficulty of Sundays,",
    "my fervor to be touched",
    "by a woman two Februarys gone. What brings the body",
    "back, grieved and cloven, tromping these woods",
    "with nothing to confide in? New snow reassumes",
    "the circleting trees, the bridge above the creek",
    "where I stand like a stranger to my life.",
    "There is no single moment of loss, there is",
    "an amassing. The disbeliever sleeps at an angle",
    "in the bed. The orchard is a graveyard.",
    "Is this the real end? Someone shoveling her way out",
    "with cold intention? Someone naming her missing?"

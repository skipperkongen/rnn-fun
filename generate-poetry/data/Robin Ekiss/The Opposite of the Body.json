    "Of the face in general, let me say it\u2019s a house",
    "built by men and lived in by their dreams.",
    "When you\u2019ve been plucking eyes",
    "out of the floorboards as long as I have,",
    "you\u2019ll see this, just as you\u2019d see",
    "the patience it requires",
    "to render an eyebrown, half an hour",
    "and an understanding of architecture.",
    "When you see your body,",
    "think its opposite: not the bridge,",
    "but its lighted face reflecting the water,",
    "some other city as seen from a ship\u2014",
    "your forehead, once ponderous,",
    "now light as umbrellas\u2014",
    "still not beautiful enough to make time stop.",
    "The pleasure in being a woman\u2019s",
    "knowing everything\u2019s borrowed",
    "and can\u2019t be denied,",
    "as when you take apart a clock,",
    "there\u2019s always another inside."

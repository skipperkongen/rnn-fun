    "Thomas Edison loved a doll",
    "with a tiny phonograph inside",
    "because he made her speak.",
    "Is there any other reason",
    "to love a woman? Did she say",
    "or something equally demure?",
    "It\u2019s hard to be sure how he feels",
    "when he holds me, I fall apart.",
    "I\u2019m projecting here. He didn\u2019t feel",
    "her first transgression",
    "was in having no expression.",
    "Ren\u00e9 Descartes, too, traveled alone",
    "with a doll-in-a-box",
    "he called his daughter.",
    "... is it better to be silent",
    "and wait for everything",
    "we were promised?",
    "Or should we love them back,",
    "the way a train loves its destination,",
    "as if we have the machinery necessary for it?"

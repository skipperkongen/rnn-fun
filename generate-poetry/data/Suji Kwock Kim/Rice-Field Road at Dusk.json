    "In the village it\u2019s the season of dried grass,",
    "the smell of burned dirt,",
    "gaslight glinting through blackened stubble.",

    "brushing insects away from my face,",
    "remembering old Namdong who was buried yesterday.",

    "I must change whatever it was I was",
    "when the old man was alive.",
    "I keep looking at the rice-fields, glinting in the dark.",
    "Blasted by mildew, more withered than last year \u2014",
    "how much work and love it must have taken.",
    "In autumn, no matter how bad the harvest,",
    "how big the debts \u2014",
    "no thought of leaving here, no thought of rest.",
    "As life goes on, time isn\u2019t the largest thing to think of,",
    "it\u2019s the smallest.",
    "Growing, going",
    "in drought or monsoon, mold or blight \u2014",
    "what is the rice if not alive?"

    "One marriage, three children, the usual hero-to-hump tale",
    "of jobs in alternating altitudes, stories of unrequited joy.",
    "Fresh identities, dramas unseen. Too much of dawn",
    "going dark, making for a rich meal of dread, when contemplating",
    "love above the brim.",
    "You also should talk about dealings with heavy weather",
    "and one-night agonies, as if descending permanently",
    "into a single distinction. It boils to skin",
    "and plain whim, or any fabrication sufficient",
    "to implicate the act.",
    "Just then, something glimpsed from a taxi careening",
    "through Paris, afterimages of a lost father\u2019s face",
    "becomes a tree in the park, tall, rustling with allusions,",
    "or was it simply cool air stealing across your face\u2014",
    "that isolation again?"

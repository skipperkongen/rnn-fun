    "1.",
    "In the land of milk and cream delivered early",
    "and daily, and always in glass bottles, we care",
    "about good grooming and, of course, news",
    "of slurs and curs ... Can it really be that home",
    "becomes a place to be stranded?",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t see a single storm cloud",
    "anywhere in the sky, but I can sure smell rain,\u201d",
    "out on the edge of Crawfordsville, Indiana,",
    "where the answers and questions become identical",
    "as evil twins.",
    "2.",
    "Basketball ghosts bounce and sweat again",
    "in that second-floor gym in the middle of July\u2014",
    "that never-to-be-forgotten home",
    "of the first-ever Boys State Championship.",
    "Rusty jump shots and long-ago corner hooks",
    "rim out in a stream of dusted sunlight.",
    "\u201cJust to play the game, don\u2019t you know,",
    "you know, no matter how much the sacrifice ... \u201d",
    "How searing afternoon\u2019s vagueness now,",
    "dreamed in a daylong haze of headache pills",
    "downed at the General Lew Wallace Motor Lodge:",
    "how the arc of the ball rises",
    "to echoes of split-jump cheers",
    "in lubricated air, when phantom bodies",
    "strive and leap and go prostrate",
    "to that squeak of rubber on polished wood\u2014",
    "in a game of shirts and skins.",
    "3.",
    "You can only wonder how Ezra Pound dissected his time here,",
    "among tractors and proctors and temples of antebellum style,",
    "as he cooed sweet Greek in the ear",
    "of his secular Madonna ... Just now, two pigeons",
    "greet first daylight on the Green of Wabash College.",
    "Something to be said for being scandalized silly,",
    "and in more than one language",
    "when life becomes holier than the Crusades.",
    "And what\u2019s more\u2014didactic passions",
    "eventually drive you insane, thinks young EP, so what?",
    "Sew buttons, ha!",
    "And make it new always ... and always",
    "leave the door cracked open, a light on,",
    "and one foot on the floor.",
    "4.",
    "\u201cThe meatloaf here\u2019s not very good,\u201d",
    "warns waitress Lucy, a pretty girl",
    "with a tooth missing. Indifferently,",
    "day proceeds utterly.",
    "Off Country Road X-10, out by Carcus Creek,",
    "driving past Minnie Betts\u2019s florist shop",
    "and what\u2019s left of the old city jail,",
    "you figure each small detail adds",
    "glory to any story.",
    "\u201cRelax,\u201d says Elton Bidwell,",
    "the county\u2019s dead-buzzard collector,",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll take care of us all",
    "when we com\u2019 on home.\u201d",
    "5.",
    "The town goes dark in a killer storm.",
    "Collective forgetting and forgiving",
    "occurs. But safety comes in many forms.",
    "In this vast black you get to thinking",
    "about giddy joys and little sorrows,",
    "the curse of full employment at minimum wage,",
    "and those conspicuous professors\u2014",
    "their bowties and braces speaking to the ages",
    "and marking moments of learned unworthiness.",
    "Maybe, it\u2019s vacuum-packed fear",
    "in a stage-managed town. Time to guess",
    "what\u2019s behind each tiny crime and local leer,",
    "at once rancorous and baffling. Strangers",
    "need not apply. A few lights click on",
    "at the Shortstop Grille. These cruel weathers",
    "turn asphalt slick. The old intramurals begin again.",
    "6.",
    "Early Sunday morning and a drunken Elton Bidwell",
    "is strung like a scarecrow on his front porch swing,",
    "deposited by Grand Wizards from the Odd Fellows Lodge bar",
    "late last night\u2014reminder to those devoted folks",
    "heading up Church Street with songbooks in hand,",
    "that home sure proves just another place to be stranded."

    "There, in the aftermath, was the voice of a man \u2014",
    "once the sweet, screwed-up boy whose hooded,",
    "jessed spirit I tried to possess with the ruthlessness",
    "I mistook for power. Here he was on NPR,",
    "so gentle, so familiar with devastation,",
    "his timbre woke the teenage falconer in me",
    "who once saw his kindness as weakness,",

    "and less aware of love than fear."

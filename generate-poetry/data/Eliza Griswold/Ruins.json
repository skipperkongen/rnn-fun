    "The dead man on the Congo road",
    "was missing an ear,",
    "which had either been eaten",
    "or someone was wearing it",
    "around his neck.",
    "The dead man looked like this. No, that.",
    "Here\u2019s a flock of tourists",
    "in matching canvas hats.",
    "This year will take from me",
    "the hardened person",
    "who I longed to be.",
    "I am healing by mistake.",
    "Rome is also built on ruins."

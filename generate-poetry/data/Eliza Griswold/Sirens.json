    "My transgressions pile against the garden wall",
    "(built when Rome began to weaken, scarred",
    "by a cannonball.) I gossiped; I snubbed",
    "a dinner guest. I watch until the wall writhes",
    "with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows",
    "and the odd librarian. I\u2019ve begun to be depleted",
    "by your absence; one of love\u2019s worst symptoms.",
    "For years, I\u2019d had the sense to hold myself apart.",
    "I\u2019ve been here long enough to kill",
    "two mint plants and a lavender,",
    "then resurrect their better part.",
    "I\u2019d like to let you die on the vine.",
    "Not you, the You I Dream,",
    "who follows through on waking.",
    "See how the watcher sees the storm",
    "but doesn\u2019t get wet. Be that.",
    "Be what?",
    "Be wiser than the heart."

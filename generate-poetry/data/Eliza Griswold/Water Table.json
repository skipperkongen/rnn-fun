    "My earliest wish was not to exist,",
    "to burst in the backyard",
    "without violence,",
    "no blood, no fleshy bits,",
    "mute button pressed",
    "alone behind the rectory",
    "where no one would see me.",
    "This wasn\u2019t a plea to be found",
    "or mourned for, but to be unborn",
    "into the atmosphere. To hang",
    "in the humid air, as ponds vent upward",
    "from the overheated earth,",
    "rise until they freeze",
    "and crystallize, then drop",
    "into the aquifer."

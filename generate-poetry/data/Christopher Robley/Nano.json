    "In an air-conditioned trailer, three geeks",
    "barely beyond boyhood fist-bump and high-five",
    "at a job well done. With the click of a key a dozen",
    "soundless screens flutter. Now in the shallow",
    "of a cave near the Khyber Pass, a stack of glow sticks",
    "activated in the blast steeps the darkness green:",
    "two cans of pineapple; a mangled can of beets",
    "bleeding juice; some boy streaked black, his burns",
    "wrapped in torn canvas tent \u00adflaps. He must hear the",
    "cyborg beetle\u2019s brains buzz like a circuit-\u00adbent keyboard",
    "above his Pashto prayers. But we know enough to",
    "leave the live feed low,",

    "Our weapon : witnessing \u2014 : wired that way.",
    "Somewhere in Texas or California or Kentucky",
    "Taco Bell is on the table where too the kill list rests",

    "like an origami acorn nestled sharply in the heart."

    "No",
    "he is not an urn singer",
    "nor does he carry on rapport",
    "with negative forces within extinction",
    "he is the brush fire singer",
    "who projects from his heart",
    "the sound of insidious subduction",
    "of blank anomaly as posture",
    "of opaque density as ash",
    "he",
    "distanced from prone ventriloqual stammer",
    "from flesh",
    "& habit",
    "& drought",
    "the performer",
    "part poltergeist & Orisha",
    "part broken in-cellular dove",
    "part glance from floating Mongol bastions",
    "where the spires are butane",
    "where their photographic fractals are implanted with hypnosis",
    "because he allegedly embodies",
    "a green necrotic umber",
    "more like a vertical flash or a farad",
    "posing like a tempest in a human chromium palace",
    "therefore his sound",
    "a dazed simoom in a gauntlet",
    "a blizzard of birds burned at the touch of old maelstroms",
    "because he gives off the odour of storms",
    "this universal Orisha",
    "like a sun that falls from a compost of dimness",
    "out of de-productive hydrogen sums",
    "out of lightless fissures which boil outside the planet",
    "yes",
    "he sings at a certain pitch",
    "which has evolved beyond the potter\u2019s field",
    "beyond a tragic hummingbird\u2019s cirrhosis",
    "surmounting primeval flaw",
    "surmounting fire which forms in irreplaceable disjunction",
    "under certain formations of the zodiac he is listless",
    "he intones without impact",
    "his synodic revelations no longer of the law",
    "of measured palpable destinations",
    "because he sings in such a silence",
    "that even the Rishis can\u2019t ignore",
    "as though",
    "the hollow power which re-arises from nothingness",
    "perpetually convinces",
    "like a vacuum which splits within the spinning arc of an",
    "intangible solar candle",
    "such power can never be confusedly re-traced",
    "because",
    "it adumbrates & blazes",
    "like a glossary of suns",
    "so that each viral drill",
    "each forge",
    "casts a feeling",
    "which in-saturates a pressure",
    "bringing to distance a hidden & elided polarity",
    "like a subjective skill",
    "corroded & advanced",
    "he sings",
    "beyond the grip of a paralytic nexus",
    "where blood shifts",
    "beyond the magnet of volume",
    "where the nerves no longer resonate",
    "inside an octagonal maze",
    "stung at its source by piranhas"

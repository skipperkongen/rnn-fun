    "With the body of a morbid hanging doll",
    "my aura burns",
    "by shifts",
    "by ambles",
    "by mirages",
    "by the sun in its primordial morass",
    "summoned from a spectral locust feast",
    "through electric bartering grammes",
    "living",
    "as if a spectrum had been transmogrified",
    "across the sum of exploded solar windows",
    "amidst motions of viral infamy",
    "of sudden discharge pontoons",
    "of magical lyncean sails above ships of pure vitrescence",
    "enthralled",
    "by empty Minoan game dogs",
    "debating oxygen as form",
    "debating menace as ideal",
    "as one listens to fire",
    "in dense eruptional gullet",
    "in hanging hydrogen mirrors",
    "so that each image is shifted",
    "back & forth",
    "between gales & the apparition of gales",
    "so that",
    "unicorns from \u00c7atal H\u00fcy\u00fck",
    "cease to condense as forms of the earth",
    "but take on the body of enigma as transparence",
    "as blackened meteor in abstraction",
    "the sun no longer quantified",
    "by strange calendrical posses",
    "but becomes",
    "balletic differential",
    "which ceases to quarrel",
    "with the magic of fragment as schism",
    "as mist",
    "as a power cast before oasis",
    "because the game dogs",
    "the unicorn mirrors",
    "spun as a wakeless ocular thirst",
    "as a conjured distance",
    "evolved from the force of a clarified activity",
    "like darkened water as shock",
    "as scale which looms as humidity",
    "then the eyes always focused",
    "as pleas for hushed exhibits"

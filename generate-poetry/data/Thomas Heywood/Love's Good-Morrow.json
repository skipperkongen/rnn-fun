    "Wake from thy nest, Robin Redbreast,",
    "Sing birds in every furrow;",
    "And from each hill, let music shrill",
    "Give my fair love good-morrow!",
    "Blackbird and thrush in every bush,",
    "Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!",
    "You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,",
    "Sing my fair love good-morrow;",
    "To give my love good-morrow,",
    "Sing birds in every furrow."

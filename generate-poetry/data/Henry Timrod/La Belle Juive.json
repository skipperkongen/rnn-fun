    "Is it because your sable hair",
    "Is folded over brows that wear",
    "At times a too imperial air;",
    "Or is it that the thoughts which rise",
    "In those dark orbs do seek disguise",
    "Beneath the lids of Eastern eyes;",
    "That choose whatever pose or place",
    "May chance to please, in you I trace",
    "The noblest women of your race?",
    "The crowd is sauntering at its ease,",
    "And humming like a hive of bees\u2014",
    "You take your seat and touch the keys.",
    "I do not hear the giddy throng;",
    "The sea avenges Israel\u2019s wrong,",
    "And on the wind floats Miriam\u2019s song!",
    "You join me with a stately grace;",
    "Music to Poesy gives place;",
    "Some grand emotion lights your face.",
    "At once I stand by Mizpeh\u2019s walls;",
    "With smiles the martyred daughter falls,",
    "And desolate are Mizpeh\u2019s halls!",
    "Intrusive babblers come between;",
    "With calm, pale brow and lofty mien,",
    "You thread the circle like a queen!",
    "Then sweeps the royal Esther by;",
    "The deep devotion in her eye",
    "Is looking \u201cIf I die, I die!\u201d",
    "You stroll the garden\u2019s flowery walks;",
    "The plants to me are grainless stalks,",
    "And Ruth to old Naomi talks.",
    "Adopted child of Judah\u2019s creed,",
    "Like Judah\u2019s daughters, true at need,",
    "I see you mid the alien seed.",
    "I watch afar the gleaner sweet;",
    "I wake like Boaz in the wheat,",
    "And find you lying at my feet!",
    "My feet! Oh! if the spell that lures",
    "My heart through all these dreams endures,",
    "How soon shall I be stretched at yours!"

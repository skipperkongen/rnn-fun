    "I should be dumb before thee, feathered sage!",
    "And gaze upon thy phiz with solemn awe,",
    "But for a most audacious wish to gauge",
    "The hoarded wisdom of thy learned craw.",
    "Art thou, grave bird! so wondrous wise indeed?",
    "Speak freely, without fear of jest or gibe\u2014",
    "What is thy moral and religious creed?",
    "And what the metaphysics of thy tribe?",
    "A Poet, curious in birds and brutes,",
    "I do not question thee in idle play;",
    "What is thy station? What are thy pursuits?",
    "Doubtless thou hast thy pleasures\u2014what are",
    "Or is\u2019t thy wont to muse and mouse at once,",
    "Entice thy prey with airs of meditation,",
    "And with the unvarying habits of a dunce,",
    "To dine in solemn depths of contemplation?",
    "There may be much\u2014the world at least says so\u2014",
    "Behind that ponderous brow and thoughtful gaze;",
    "Yet such a great philosopher should know,",
    "It is by no means wise to think always.",
    "And, Bird, despite thy meditative air,",
    "I hold thy stock of wit but paltry pelf\u2014",
    "Thou show\u2019st that same grave aspect everywhere,",
    "And wouldst look thoughtful, stuffed, upon a shelf.",
    "I grieve to be so plain, renowned Bird\u2014",
    "Thy fame\u2019s a flam, and thou an empty fowl;",
    "And what is more, upon a Poet\u2019s word",
    "I\u2019d say as much, wert thou Minerva\u2019s owl.",
    "So doff th\u2019 imposture of those heavy brows;",
    "They do not serve to hide thy instincts base\u2014",
    "And if thou must be sometimes munching",
    "Munch it, O Owl! with less profound a face."

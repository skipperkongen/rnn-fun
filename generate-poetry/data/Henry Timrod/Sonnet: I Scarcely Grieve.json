    "I scarcely grieve, O Nature! at the lot",
    "That pent my life within a city\u2019s bounds,",
    "And shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds.",
    "Perhaps I had not learned, if some lone cot",
    "Had nursed a dreamy childhood, what the mart",
    "Taught me amid its turmoil; so my youth",
    "Had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth.",
    "Here, too, O Nature! in this haunt of Art,",
    "Thy power is on me, and I own thy thrall.",
    "There is no unimpressive spot on earth!",
    "The beauty of the stars is over all,",
    "And Day and Darkness visit every hearth.",
    "Clouds do not scorn us: yonder factory\u2019s smoke",
    "Looked like a golden mist when morning broke."

    "I thank you, kind and best beloved friend,",
    "With the same thanks one murmurs to a sister,",
    "When, for some gentle favor, he hath kissed her,",
    "Less for the gifts than for the love you send,",
    "Less for the flowers, than what the flowers convey;",
    "If I, indeed, divine their meaning truly,",
    "And not unto myself ascribe, unduly,",
    "Things which you neither meant nor wished to say,",
    "Oh! tell me, is the hope then all misplaced?",
    "And am I flattered by my own affection?",
    "But in your beauteous gift, methought I traced",
    "Something above a short-lived predilection,",
    "And which, for that I know no dearer name,",
    "I designate as love, without love\u2019s flame."

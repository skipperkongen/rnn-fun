    "It may be through some foreign grace,",
    "And unfamiliar charm of face;",
    "It may be that across the foam",
    "Which bore her from her childhood\u2019s home,",
    "By some strange spell, my Katie brought,",
    "Along with English creeds and thought\u2014",
    "Entangled in her golden hair\u2014",
    "Some English sunshine, warmth, and air!",
    "I cannot tell\u2014but here to-day,",
    "A thousand billowy leagues away",
    "From that green isle whose twilight skies",
    "No darker are than Katie\u2019s eyes,",
    "She seems to me, go where she will,",
    "An English girl in England still;",
    "I meet her on the dusty street,",
    "And daisies spring about her feet;",
    "Or, touched to life beneath her tread,",
    "An English cowslip lifts its head;",
    "And, as to do her grace, rise up",
    "The primrose and the buttercup!",
    "I roam with her through fields of cane,",
    "And seem to stroll an English lane,",
    "Which, white with blossoms of the May,",
    "Spreads its green carpet in her way!",
    "As fancy wills, the path beneath",
    "Is golden gorse, or purple heath:",
    "And now we hear in woodlands dim",
    "Their unarticulated hymn,",
    "Now walk through rippling waves of wheat,",
    "Now sink in mats of clover sweet,",
    "Or see before us from the lawn",
    "The lark go up to greet the dawn!",
    "All birds that love the English sky",
    "Throng round my path when she is by:",
    "The blackbird from a neighboring thorn",
    "With music brims the cup of morn,",
    "And in a thick, melodious rain",
    "The mavis pours her mellow strain!",
    "But only when my Katie\u2019s voice",
    "Makes all the listening woods rejoice",
    "I hear\u2014with cheeks that flush and pale\u2014",
    "The passion of the nightingale!",
    "Anon the pictures round her change,",
    "And through an ancient town we range,",
    "Whereto the shadowy memory clings",
    "Of one of England\u2019s Saxon kings,",
    "And which to shrine his fading fame",
    "Still keeps his ashes and his name.",
    "Quaint houses rise on either hand,",
    "But still the airs are fresh and bland,",
    "As if their gentle wings caressed",
    "Some new-born village of the West.",
    "A moment by the Norman tower",
    "We pause; it is the Sabbath hour!",
    "And o\u2019er the city sinks and swells",
    "The chime of old St. Mary\u2019s bells,",
    "Which still resound in Katie\u2019s ears",
    "As sweet as when in distant years",
    "She heard them peal with jocund din",
    "A merry English Christmas in!",
    "We pass the abbey\u2019s ruined arch,",
    "And statelier grows my Katie\u2019s march,",
    "As round her, wearied with the taint",
    "Of Transatlantic pine and paint,",
    "She sees a thousand tokens cast",
    "Of England\u2019s venerable Past!",
    "Our reverent footsteps lastly claims",
    "The younger chapel of St. James,",
    "Which though, as English records run,",
    "Not old, had seen full many a sun,",
    "Ere to the cold December gale",
    "The sullen Pilgrim spread his sail.",
    "There Katie in her childish days",
    "Spelt out her prayers and lisped her praise,",
    "And doubtless, as her beauty grew,",
    "Did much as other maidens do\u2014",
    "Across the pews and down the aisle",
    "Sent many a beau-bewildering smile,",
    "And to subserve her spirit\u2019s need",
    "Learned other things beside the creed!",
    "There, too, to-day her knee she bows,",
    "And by her one whose darker brows",
    "Betray the Southern heart that burns",
    "Beside her, and which only turns",
    "Its thoughts to Heaven in one request,",
    "Not all unworthy to be blest,",
    "But rising from an earthlier pain",
    "Than might beseem a Christian fane.",
    "Ah! can the guileless maiden share",
    "The wish that lifts that passionate prayer?",
    "Is all at peace that breast within?",
    "Good angels! warn her of the sin!",
    "Alas! what boots it? who can save",
    "A willing victim of the wave?",
    "Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt?",
    "Or gather wine when wine is spilt?",
    "We quit the holy house and gain",
    "The open air; then, happy twain,",
    "Adown familiar streets we go,",
    "And now and then she turns to show,",
    "With fears that all is changing fast,",
    "Some spot that\u2019s sacred to her Past.",
    "Here by this way, through shadows cool,",
    "A little maid, she tripped to school;",
    "And there each morning used to stop",
    "Before a wonder of a shop",
    "Where, built of apples and of pears,",
    "Rose pyramids of golden spheres;",
    "While, dangling in her dazzled sight,",
    "Ripe cherries cast a crimson light,",
    "And made her think of elfin lamps,",
    "And feast and sport in fairy camps,",
    "Whereat, upon her royal throne",
    "(Most richly carved in cherry-stone),",
    "Titania ruled, in queenly state,",
    "The boisterous revels of the f\u00eate!",
    "\u2019T was yonder, with their \u201chorrid\u201d noise,",
    "Dismissed from books, she met the boys,",
    "Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls,",
    "Glanced slightly at her sunny curls,",
    "And laughed and leaped as reckless by",
    "As though no pretty face were nigh!",
    "But\u2014here the maiden grows demure\u2014",
    "Indeed she\u2019s not so",
    "sure,",
    "That in a year, or haply twain,",
    "Few looked who failed to look again,",
    "And sooth to say, I little doubt",
    "(Some azure day, the truth will out!)",
    "That certain baits in certain eyes",
    "Caught many an unsuspecting prize;",
    "And somewhere underneath these eaves",
    "A budding flirt put forth its leaves!",
    "Has not the sky a deeper blue,",
    "Have not the trees a greener hue,",
    "And bend they not with lordlier grace",
    "And nobler shapes above the place",
    "Where on one cloudless winter morn",
    "My Katie to this life was born?",
    "Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour",
    "When love to sight gave keener power,",
    "And lovers looked for special boons",
    "In brighter flowers and larger moons.",
    "But wave the foliage as it may,",
    "And let the sky be ashen gray,",
    "Thus much at least a manly youth",
    "May hold\u2014and yet not blush\u2014as truth:",
    "If near that blessed spot of earth",
    "Which saw the cherished maiden\u2019s birth",
    "No softer dews than usual rise,",
    "And life there keeps its wonted guise,",
    "Yet not the less that spot may seem",
    "As lovely as a poet\u2019s dream;",
    "And should a fervid faith incline",
    "To make thereof a sainted shrine,",
    "Who may deny that round us throng",
    "A hundred earthly creeds as wrong,",
    "But meaner far, which yet unblamed",
    "Stalk by us and are not ashamed.",
    "So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll",
    "Ends at this portal, while you roll",
    "Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray",
    "That may recall some vanished day,",
    "I\u2014let them jeer and laugh who will\u2014",
    "Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!",
    "So strongly sometimes on the sense",
    "These fancies hold their influence,",
    "That in long well-known streets I stray",
    "Like one who fears to lose his way.",
    "The stranger, I, the native, she,",
    "Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea;",
    "And changing place, and mixing times,",
    "I walk in unfamiliar climes!",
    "These houses, free to every breeze",
    "That blows from warm Floridian seas,",
    "Assume a massive English air,",
    "And close around an English square;",
    "While, if I issue from the town,",
    "An English hill looks greenly down,",
    "Or round me rolls an English park,",
    "And in the Broad I hear the Larke!",
    "Thus when, where woodland violets hide,",
    "I rove with Katie at my side,",
    "It scarce would seem amiss to say,",
    "\u201cKatie! my home lies far away,",
    "Beyond the pathless waste of brine,",
    "In a young land of palm and pine!",
    "There, by the tropic heats, the soul",
    "Is touched as if with living coal,",
    "And glows with such a fire as none",
    "Can feel beneath a Northern sun,",
    "Unless\u2014my Katie\u2019s heart attest!\u2014",
    "\u2019T is kindled in an English breast!",
    "Such is the land in which I live,",
    "And, Katie! such the soul I give.",
    "Come! ere another morning beam,",
    "We\u2019ll cleave the sea with wings of steam;",
    "And soon, despite of storm or calm,",
    "Beneath my native groves of palm,",
    "Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride,",
    "The Southron and his English bride!\u201d"

    "You could whistle me home from anywhere",
    "in the neighborhood; avenues away,",
    "I\u2019d pick out your clear, alternating pair",
    "of notes, the signal to quit my child\u2019s play",
    "and run back to our house for supper,",
    "or a Saturday trip to the hardware store.",
    "Unthrottled, wavering in the upper",
    "reaches, your trilled summons traveled farther",
    "than our few blocks. I\u2019ve learned too, how your heart\u2019s",
    "radius extends, though its beat",
    "has stopped. Still, some days a sudden fear darts",
    "through me, whether it\u2019s my own city street",
    "I hurry across, or at a corner in an unknown",
    "town: the high, vacant air arrests me\u2014"

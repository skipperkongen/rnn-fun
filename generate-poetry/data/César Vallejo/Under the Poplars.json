    "Like priestly imprisoned poets,",

    "On the hills, the flocks of Bethlehem",

    "The ancient shepherd, who shivers",
    "at the last martyrdoms of light,",
    "in his Easter eyes has caught",
    "a purebred flock of stars.",
    "Formed in orphanhood, he goes down",
    "with rumors of burial to the praying field,",
    "and the sheep bells are seasoned with shadow.",
    "It survives, the blue warped",
    "In iron, and on it, pupils shrouded,",
    "A dog etches its pastoral howl."

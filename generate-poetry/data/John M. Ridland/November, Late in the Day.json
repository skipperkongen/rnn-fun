    "So this is aging: the bare sun, skinned,",
    "palely bucking the dark wind,",
    "slides through the glass, crawls on the carpet,",
    "climbs the footboard, lies crosswise on the blanket,",
    "a spoiled dog waiting to be fed.",
    "Not now, dear warmth. The kindling\u2019s in the shed,",
    "too far to fetch. Those two great logs that close",
    "together to make fire, repose",
    "apart, an old couple reminiscing",
    "on conflagrations they\u2019re now missing:",
    "how every sunny Saturday afternoon,",
    "Hey, diddle-diddle, the dish ran away with the spoon.",
    "Not yet, dear spoon. Some hotter day, dear dish.",
    "No tidbits now. Instead, let\u2019s make a wish,",
    "and boil fresh water for the small teapot",
    "to keep it piping hot."

    "I'm working on my poems and working with",
    "my fingers not my head. Because my fingers",
    "are the farthest stretching things from me.",
    "Look at the tree. Like its longest branch",
    "I touch the evening's quiet breathing. Sounds",
    "of rain. The crackling heat from other trees.",
    "The tree points everywhere. The branches can't",
    "reach to their roots though. Growing longer they",
    "grow weaker also. Can't make use of water.",
    "Rain falls. But I'm working with these farthest stretching",
    "things from me. Along my fingertips bare shoots",
    "of days then years unfurl in the cold air."

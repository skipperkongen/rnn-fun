    "A furnace in my father\u2019s voice; I prayed for the coal stove\u2019s",
    "roses, a cruise ship lit like a castle",
    "on fire in the harbor we never walked,",
    "father and son, father drifting down",
    "the ferned hell his shanty shone, where,",
    "inside, in my head, the lamp was the lamp.",
    "The market, the park, the library not a soul",
    "but grandmother\u2019s morning wash lifting toward heaven,",
    "the barrister sun punished my sister, I stared at my hand",
    "in a book, the horizon declined in my mouth.",
    "My little earthshaker, visored in placenta,",
    "wonder of wonders, tremulous in amniotic",
    "shield, ensouled already, father in the veritable",
    "night, without house or harbor,",
    "soon sea in a voice will harrow",
    "a scorpion\u2019s blaze in me, to the marrow."

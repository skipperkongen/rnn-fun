    "Brailed up from birth, these obdurate, obituary corners",
    "of second life the hospital light ravened solstice",
    "blessed with a caesarean and now we have a republic,",
    "the bread under arm, water-bearer of the sea: Cetus, Christ.",
    "After the blackbird I put on my herringbone jacket,",
    "the feather hummed gargoyles bearing down buildings,",
    "rain scowled down,",
    "and",
    "as I hurried",
    "up Eager Street; Thursday, I remember the white stone",
    "in the flask and wild asterisks hissing; Thursdays, falling",
    "at noon, at Cathedral Street, blackbirds falling quietly at Biddle Street."

    "On the platter set out in the center of the Maty\u00f3-embroidered tablecloth",
    "was the syringe. And around it was silence. My father",
    "gazed at my mother, and she back at him. Slowly,",
    "faltering, he began to speak. I was seized by",
    "an unusual shuddering. I recall that he used the word",
    ",",
    "and that if I consented to the injected dose,",
    "we could all fall asleep. We would stay together",
    "for all time. And evade the uncertainty in mortifying",
    "desperation. A fifteen-year-old\u2019s desire to live",
    "cried out in me: \u201cNo!\u201d To which",
    "my father stated: \u201cIf you want to live, then",
    "we too must keep on living, because we can\u2019t leave you",
    "by yourself.\u201d My father was the village doctor. I grew up",
    "with no siblings. My mother\u2019s sister lived next door,",
    "with her husband and two children, Nelly and Gyurika.",
    "In the evenings I prayed: \u201cMerciful Lord of mine,",
    "My eyes have closed, but thine, yet still are open, father mine,",
    "Watch over me as I recline.\u201d Then this: \u201cIn one God",
    "I believe, in one homeland I believe, in the eternal",
    "divine truth I believe, in Hungary\u2019s re-",
    "surrection I believe. Amen.\u201d Gyuri could not study in Pest,",
    "he went to Br\u00fcnn. Later, not even there. Then the family",
    "sent him to Toulouse. My mind could not comprehend. Then",
    "one of uncle Vilmos\u2019s servants murdered him with six ax-blows.",
    "He screamed crazed into the courtyard: \u201cThat\u2019s what",
    "the stinking Jew deserved!\u201d I found him, his head smashed open.",
    "I ran to my father, who didn\u2019t even believe it. And one after",
    "the other, the horrors came. Nelly lived in \u00dajvid\u00e9k",
    "with her husband. Uncle Ern\u0151 was in the middle of shaving when",
    "Hungarians broke into the flat. They were looking for the family.",
    "The nanny quickly threw a quilt onto six-month-old Tomika,",
    "they didn\u2019t notice him. Peterke was out with Nelly. Uncle Ern",
    "was executed on the ice of the Danube. Nelly did not recover.",
    "She knitted pullovers, each more beautiful than the next, so as not",
    "to feel the pain. She went to Pest to learn a trade,",
    "so she could support her children. That\u2019s how it was when",
    "nineteen-forty-four came. On March 15, one of my teachers said,",
    "\u201cYou remain seated,\u201d while the class sang the Anthem,",
    "\u201cand be quiet.\u201d On the day of the nineteenth, the Germans",
    "invaded. From then on, it was obligatory to wear the star.",
    "Through the intervention of the medical officer and the Lord Lieutenant, my father",
    "could have stayed out. I had to move to the ghetto with my mother. My",
    "father said \u201cThe family should stay together.\u201d All up and down",
    "our street they stood, to bid farewell. Father acknowledged",
    "them, but already he was just waiting",
    "for the end. He had aged by decades. Then the injection,",
    "the one I already spoke of, turned up on the table with the",
    "Maty\u00f3 embroidery. We sat in the evening underneath the open sky",
    "before being loaded onto the freight cars. The doctor from the next village",
    "drank mercury chloride with his wife. Despite my father\u2019s stomach lavage,",
    "they succumbed by the morning. There were eighty of us in the wagon.",
    "An expectant mother gave birth on the way. But with no water, my father",
    "could not save them. There were those who went mad in the freight cars.",
    "My father taught me always to say \u201cIch will",
    "arbeiten.\u201d On the seventh of July the train stopped. Father read",
    "the plaque, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and said, \u201cWe are",
    "lost!\u201d Megaphones blared, \u201cLeave your packages",
    "in the wagons, they will be brought to you later. Special vehicles",
    "are coming for the sick and the elderly, just remain sitting,\u201d",
    "they repeated, \u201ceverything will be fine. Men exit",
    "the wagon to the left, women to the right.\u201d As farewell,",
    "my papa said, \u201cAlways be my clever, my obedient, my good",
    "little girl... \u201d That is how we parted for eternity. Tomika and Peterke",
    "were squeezing my hand tightly, but my mother said, \u201cDon\u2019t",
    "you want to sit down? We can walk. Come... \u201d",
    "We moved forward in a column of five rows. The bulbs of the searchlights",
    "blinded us in the eyes. A German officer, legs wide apart. He stood there",
    "somewhere far away. Sent us to the right. Had to get undressed",
    "in a room. Then they sent us into another, and the iron door slammed,",
    "bolted shut. Screaming, I pounded on it again and again. We truly",
    "were lost, as last I understood.... Turning around, the others",
    "already shaved bald. I didn\u2019t recognize anyone.",
    "They stood there like sheep. Upon their skin, the writing of gooseflesh."

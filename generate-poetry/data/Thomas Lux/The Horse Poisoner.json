    "No one knew why horses were dying \u2014 two from two farms over,",
    "one in town, three at the poor farm (not in great shape,",
    "anyway, so no",
    "concern at first), then the mayor\u2019s son\u2019s pony,",
    "then three stalls in a row",
    "at the local sulky track. The vet sent blood to the State Police,",
    "who sent it to Boston for \u201cfurther analysis.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, two more died.",
    "One so old it was no surprise,",
    "and another mistaken for a deer and shot.",
    "Some people wanted to make a connection,",
    "but the errant hunter was cousin to the sheriff",
    "and was known as too dim to pull off",
    "a string of horse poisonings.",
    "There were no more suspicious deaths",
    "in the county for two months. Then three, lying down",
    "next to each other, seen first by my cousin Freddy",
    "at dawn in the town square.",
    "He delivered newspapers.",
    "Horses rarely lie down flat",
    "unless they\u2019re sick, or dead.",
    "Test results came back",
    "from Boston and, Freddy said, also the Feds.",
    "Inconclusive, though each necropsy",
    "showed that the poison",
    "was delivered with the aid of a carrot",
    "or a sugar cube",
    "a carrot."

    "It\u2019s the little towns I like",
    "with their little mills making ratchets",
    "and stanchions, elastic web,",
    "spindles, you",
    "name it. I like them in New England,",
    "America, particularly-providing",
    "bad jobs good enough to live on, to live in",
    "families even: kindergarten,",
    "church suppers, beach umbrellas ... The towns",
    "are real, so fragile in their loneliness",
    "a flood could come along",
    "(and floods have) and cut them in two,",
    "in half. There is no mayor,",
    "the town council\u2019s not prepared",
    "for this, three of the four policemen",
    "are stranded on their roofs ... and it doesn\u2019t stop",
    "raining. The mountain",
    "is so thick with water parts of it just slide",
    "down on the heifers\u2014soggy, suicidal\u2014",
    "in the pastures below. It rains, it rains",
    "in these towns and, because",
    "there\u2019s no other way, your father gets in a rowboat",
    "so he can go to work."

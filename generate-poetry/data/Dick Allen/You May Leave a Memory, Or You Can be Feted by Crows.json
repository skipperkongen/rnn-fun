    "Three years, Huang Gongwang",
    "worked on his famous handscroll,",
    "As he put successive applications of ink to paper",
    "over the \u201cone burst of creation,\u201d his original design,",
    "it is said he often sang like a tree frog",
    "and danced on his old bare feet.",
    "One day, he adds one hemp fiber stroke,",
    "the next a moss dot.",
    "What patience he had,",
    "like a cat who comes back season after season to a mole\u2019s tunnel.",
    "Honors may go to others.",
    "Riches may go to others.",
    "Huang Gongwang has one great job to do.",
    "And he sings like a tree frog,",
    "and he dances on old bare feet."

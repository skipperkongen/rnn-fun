    "Make your strokes thus:",
    ":",
    "as a cloud that slowly drifts across the horizon;",
    ": as an ancient but strong vine stem;",
    ": a falling rock;",
    "and learn to master",
    "an apricot kernel, a dewdrop, the new moon,",
    "the wave rising and falling",
    "Do these",
    "while holding your arm out above the paper",
    "like the outstretched leg of a crane.",
    "The strength of your hand",
    "will give the stroke its bone.",
    "But for real accomplishment, it would be well",
    "if you would go to live solitary in a forest silence,",
    "or beside a river flowing serenely.",
    "It might also be useful",
    "to look down a lonesome road,",
    "and for the future",
    "to stare into the gray static of a television screen,",
    "or when lost in a video game",
    "to accept you may never reach the final level,",
    "where the dragon awaits, guarding the pot of gold,",
    "and that you\u2019ve left no footprints, not a single one,",
    "despite all your adventures,",
    "anyone following you could ever follow."

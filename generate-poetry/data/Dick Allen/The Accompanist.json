    "I\u2019ve always worried about you\u2014the man or woman",
    "at the piano bench,",
    "night after night receiving only such applause",
    "as the singer allows:",
    "for my accompanist. At concerts,",
    "as I watch your fingers on the keys,",
    "and how swiftly, how excellently",
    "you turn sheet music pages,",
    "track the singer\u2019s notes, cover the singer\u2019s flaws,",
    "I worry about whole lifetimes,",
    "most lifetimes",
    "lived in the shadows of reflected fame;",
    "but then the singer\u2019s voice dies",
    "and there are just your last piano notes,",
    "not resentful at all,",
    "carrying us to the end, into those heartfelt cheers",
    "that spring up in little patches from a thrilled audience",
    "like sudden wildflowers bobbing in a rain",
    "of steady clapping. And I\u2019m on my feet, also,",
    "clapping and cheering for the singer, yes,",
    "but, I think, partially likewise for you",
    "half-turned toward us, balanced on your black bench,",
    "modest, utterly well-rehearsed,",
    "still playing the part you\u2019ve made yours."

    "For thunder and lightning",
    "But ominous as a closed fist",
    "And what it will bring",
    "Nearing us, growing larger,",
    "Is completely unknown.",
    "The spot on the sun.",
    "All is turned toward it. It rides",
    "The brow of the mind.",
    "Soon, it will shadow one cliff",
    "And a small coastal shrine.",
    "Do your work well. Behold",
    "The work yet to be done."

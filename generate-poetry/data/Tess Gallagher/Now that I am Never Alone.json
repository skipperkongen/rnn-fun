    "In the bath I look up and see the brown moth",
    "pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips",
    "against the white wall. I heat up",
    "the water, running as much hot in as I can stand.",
    "These handfuls over my shoulder\u2014how once",
    "he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped",
    "a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring",
    "we were drinking from. Beautiful mischief",
    "that stills a moment so I can never look",
    "back. Only now, brightest now, and the water",
    "never hot enough to drive that shiver out.",
    "But I remember solitude\u2014no other",
    "presence and each thing what it was. Not this raw",
    "fluttering I make of you as you have made of me",
    "your watch-fire, your killing light."

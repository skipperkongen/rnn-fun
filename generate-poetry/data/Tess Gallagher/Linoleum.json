    "There are the few we hear of",
    "like Christ, who, with divine grace,",
    "made goodness look easy, had",
    "a following to draw near, gave up",
    "the right things and saw to it",
    "that sinners got listened to.",
    "Sharpening my failures, I remember",
    "the Jains, the gentle swoosh",
    "of their brooms on a dirt path",
    "trodden by children and goats, each",
    "thoughtful step taken in peril of",
    "an ant\u2019s life or a fat grub hidden",
    "under a stick. In the car-wash,",
    "thinking of yogis under a tree",
    "plucking hair by hair the head",
    "of an initiate, I feel at least",
    "elsewhere those able for holiness\u2014",
    "its signs and rigors\u2014are at work.",
    "Ignominiously, I am here, brushes",
    "clamped, soap and water pulsing",
    "against my car. (A good sign too,",
    "those asylums for old and diseased",
    "animals.) My car is clean",
    "and no one has had to",
    "lift a finger. The dead",
    "bugs have been gushed away into a soup",
    "of grit and foam\u2014the evidence",
    "not subterranean, not streaming along",
    "the asphalt in sunlight so dazzling",
    "I attend the birth-moment of",
    "the word",
    "I care about the bugs and not",
    "in this life will I do enough towards",
    "my own worth in the memory",
    "of them. I appreciate the Jains,",
    "their atonements for my neglect,",
    "though I understand it makes poor farmers",
    "of them, and good we all",
    "don\u2019t aspire to such purity so",
    "there\u2019s somebody heartless enough to",
    "plow the spuds.",
    "Early on in admiration, I put off",
    "knowledge, and so delayed reading about",
    "the Jains\u2014not to lose",
    "solace. But in the County Library,",
    "turning a page, I meet them as",
    "the wealthiest moneylenders",
    "in Western India. Reading on,",

    "exceeds vices\u2014just four",
    "of those: anger, pride, illusion and",
    "greed. The emphasis clearly on",
    "striving. I write them down",
    "in the corner of a map",
    "of Idaho: forbearance, indulgence,",
    "straightforwardness, purity,",
    "veracity, restraint, freedom from",
    "attachment to anything, poverty",
    "and chastity.",
    "Choosing, getting into the car to",
    "get to the supermarket, hearing",
    "over engine noise the bright agonies",
    "of birds, the radio news with the child",
    "nailed into a broom-closet for",
    "twenty-four hours by parents who",
    "in straightforwardness sacrificed",
    "forbearance, I feel a longing",
    "for religion, for doctrine swift",
    "as a broom to keep the path",
    "clear. Later, alone in the kitchen",
    "with the groceries, I read the list",
    "again. Overwhelmed by the loneliness",
    "of the saints, I take up my broom",
    "and begin where I stand,",
    "with linoleum."

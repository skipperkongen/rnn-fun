    "From narrow provinces",
    "of fish and bread and tea,",
    "home of the long tides",
    "where the bay leaves the sea",

    "the bay coming in,",
    "the bay not at home;",
    "where, silted red,",

    "in burning rivulets;",
    "on red, gravelly roads,",
    "down rows of sugar maples,",
    "past clapboard farmhouses",
    "and neat, clapboard churches,",
    "bleached, ridged as clamshells,",
    "past twin silver birches,",
    "through late afternoon",
    "a bus journeys west,",
    "the windshield flashing pink,",
    "pink glancing off of metal,",
    "brushing the dented flank",
    "of blue, beat-up enamel;",

    "on bushes in a pasture.",
    "The passengers lie back.",
    "Snores. Some long sighs.",
    "A dreamy divagation",
    "begins in the night,",
    "a gentle, auditory,",
    "slow hallucination....",
    "In the creakings and noises,",
    "an old conversation",

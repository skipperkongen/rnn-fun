    "When you found me there was nothing beautiful about me.",
    "I wasn\u2019t even human",
    "just a mongrel",
    "kicked out into the snow on Maundy Thursday",
    "when all the world was sorrow,",
    "when old girls\u2019 hands were raw as they cracked",
    "the ice on their birdbaths,",
    "when the priest wept in Saint Jude the Apostle",
    "as he knelt to wash the feet of an altar boy.",
    "I was filth,",
    "running away from God knows what,",
    "my haunches sore with bruises,",
    "my spine knuckling the ruin of my coat.",
    "Running through the town",
    "away from the horses",
    "who bowed their heads to the donkey-bite,",
    "away from the boy in the bus shelter",
    "who turned from me",
    "to receive a snowflake",
    "like a wafer on his tongue.",
    "Lord help me",
    "I did things I would once",
    "have been ashamed of.",
    "Now no one would come near me,",
    "they feared",
    "the hunger that gnawed and whined in my bones,",
    "the hurt I would carry into their houses.",
    "Only you dared follow",
    "upon the track",
    "of my bloodied paw prints in the ice,",
    "where the trees held snow in their arms",
    "like winding sheets.",
    "You came for me there",
    "close, low,",
    "calling a name that was not mine.",
    "Calling",
    "as the tongues of the church bells rang mute.",
    "At your scent on the air,",
    "I shot",
    "through the woods \u2014 a gray cry \u2014",
    "so raw only the dusk could touch me",
    "but you were patient,",
    "waited",
    "through the dense muffled hours",
    "until darkness dropped and I sank into the midden",
    "behind the factory",
    "and the chimneys cast a wreath of ash upon me.",
    "You touched me then,",
    "when I was nothing but dirt,",
    "took off your glove and laid your palm upon my throat,",
    "slipped the loop of the rope,",
    "lifted me",
    "into your arms and carried me home",
    "along the first path.",
    "In the banks the foxes barked",
    ".",
    "The blizzard tumbled upon us like confetti",
    "and I, little bitch, blue bruise,",
    "saw myself in your eyes:",
    "a bride."

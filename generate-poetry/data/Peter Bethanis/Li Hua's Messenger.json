    "In a hut far from the village",
    "Li Hua bends over his canvas",
    "like an insect.",
    "He is so deliberate,",
    "each stroke is a spider's legs",
    "fighting the current.",
    "There is a war in his veins,",
    "a battle of desires.",
    "He is jealous of Li Po",
    "whose pictures glide",
    "like the moon over dark water.",
    "I do not wish",
    "to disturb him",
    "as he tries to make art",
    "in this time of death,",
    "so I will wait,",
    "like a fly on the tip of a stick,",
    "until he is finished."

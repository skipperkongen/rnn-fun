    "If the body is primal, if the body is performed,",
    "if the body is a city made of matches,",
    "something the self burns as it retreats,",
    "if death is a victory, if death is a cascade,",
    "if death is the moment when the pianist rises",
    "from the piano and the piano plays on,",
    "if you are a theater, if you are the wandering",
    "troupe, if you have checked, lost traveler,",
    "into the softest of hotels, if you already existed,",
    "in endless repetitions, like an echo which,",
    "biopsied, grows to completion, like the flames",
    "on a candelabra, not just born from a single",
    "match, but wavering in the tip before it\u2019s",
    "struck, the whole hive singularized, a queen",
    "subject to her ovaries, if the same horses",
    "grazing in me are grazing in you, if the body",
    "is a field written in hoofprints, the whole",
    "ghostly herd passing through, then I\u2019ll meet you",
    "where the generations end, where the last gene",
    "evaporates, my invisible, my twin...And",
    "Fortinbras enters, followed closely by the wind."

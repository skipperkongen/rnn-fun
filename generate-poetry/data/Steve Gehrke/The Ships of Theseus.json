    "The answer of course is that the ship",
    "doesn\u2019t exist, that \u201cship\u201d",
    "is an abstraction, a conception,",
    "an imaginary tarp thrown",
    "across the garden of the real.",
    "The answer is that the cheap",
    "peasantry of things toils all day",
    "in the kingdom of language,",
    "every ship like a casket",
    "of words:",
    "mast steps. The answer",
    "is to wake again to the banality",
    "of things, to wade toward",
    "the light inside the plasma",
    "of ideas. But each plank",
    "is woven from your mother\u2019s",
    "hair. The blade of each oar",
    "contains the shadow of",
    "a horse. The answer",
    "is that the self is the glue between",
    "the boards, the cartilage",
    "that holds a world together,",
    "that self is the wax in",
    "the stenographer\u2019s ears,",
    "that there is nothing the mind",
    "won\u2019t sacrifice, each",
    "another goat tossed into",
    "the lava of our needs.",
    "The answer is that this is just",
    "another poem about divorce,",
    "about untombing the mattress",
    "from the sofa, your body",
    "laid out on the bones of the",
    "double-jointed frame, about",
    "separation, rebuilding, about",
    "your daughter\u2019s missing",
    "teeth. Each time you visit",
    "now you find her partially",
    "replaced, more sturdily",
    "jointed, the weathered joists",
    "of her childhood being stripped",
    "away. New voice. New hair.",
    "The answer is to stand there",
    "redrawing the constellation",
    "of the word",
    "in",
    "your brain while she tries",
    "to understand exactly who",
    "you are, and breathes out",
    "girl after girl into the entry-",
    "way, a fog of strangers that",
    "almost evaporates when",
    "you say each other\u2019s",
    "names. Almost, but not quite.",
    "Let it be enough. Already,",
    "a third ship moves",
    "quietly toward you in the night."

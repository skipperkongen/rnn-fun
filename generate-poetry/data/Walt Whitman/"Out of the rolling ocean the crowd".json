    "Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,",
    "Whispering,",
    "I have travell\u2019d a long way merely to look on you to touch you,",
    "For I could not die till I once look\u2019d on you,",
    "For I fear\u2019d I might afterward lose you.",
    "Now we have met, we have look\u2019d, we are safe,",
    "Return in peace to the ocean my love,",
    "I too am part of that ocean, my love, we are not so much separated,",
    "Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect!",
    "But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,",
    "As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse forever;",
    "Be not impatient \u2013 a little space \u2013 know you I salute the air, the ocean and the land,",
    "Every day at sundown for your dear sake, my love."

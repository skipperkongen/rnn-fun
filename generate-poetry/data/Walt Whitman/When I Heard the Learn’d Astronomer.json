    "When I heard the learn\u2019d astronomer,",
    "When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,",
    "When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,",
    "When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,",
    "How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,",
    "Till rising and gliding out I wander\u2019d off by myself,",
    "In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,",
    "Look\u2019d up in perfect silence at the stars."

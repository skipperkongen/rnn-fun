    "1",
    "An old man bending I come among new faces,",
    "Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,",
    "Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,",
    "(Arous\u2019d and angry, I\u2019d thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,",
    "But soon my fingers fail\u2019d me, my face droop\u2019d and I resign\u2019d myself,",
    "To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)",
    "Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,",
    "Of unsurpass\u2019d heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)",
    "Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,",
    "Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?",
    "What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,",
    "Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?",
    "2",
    "O maidens and young men I love and that love me,",
    "What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,",
    "Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover\u2019d with sweat and dust,",
    "In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush of successful charge,",
    "Enter the captur\u2019d works\u2014yet lo, like a swift running river they fade,",
    "Pass and are gone they fade\u2014I dwell not on soldiers\u2019 perils or soldiers\u2019 joys,",
    "(Both I remember well\u2014many of the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)",
    "But in silence, in dreams\u2019 projections,",
    "While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,",
    "So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,",
    "With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,",
    "Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)",
    "Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,",
    "Straight and swift to my wounded I go,",
    "Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,",
    "Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground,",
    "Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof\u2019d hospital,",
    "To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,",
    "To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,",
    "An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,",
    "Soon to be fill\u2019d with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill\u2019d again.",
    "I onward go, I stop,",
    "With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,",
    "I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,",
    "One turns to me his appealing eyes\u2014poor boy! I never knew you,",
    "Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.",
    "3",
    "On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)",
    "The crush\u2019d head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)",
    "The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I examine,",
    "Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life struggles hard,",
    "(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!",
    "In mercy come quickly.)",
    "From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,",
    "I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,",
    "Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv\u2019d neck and side falling head,",
    "His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody stump,",
    "And has not yet look\u2019d on it.",
    "I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,",
    "But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,",
    "And the yellow-blue countenance see.",
    "I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,",
    "Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive,",
    "While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.",
    "I am faithful, I do not give out,",
    "The fractur\u2019d thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,",
    "These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame.)",
    "4",
    "Thus in silence in dreams\u2019 projections,",
    "Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,",
    "The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,",
    "I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,",
    "Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,",
    "(Many a soldier\u2019s loving arms about this neck have cross\u2019d and rested,",
    "Many a soldier\u2019s kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)"

    "O, Death! a black and pierceless pall",
    "Hangs round thee, and the future state;",
    "No eye may see, no mind may grasp",
    "That mystery of fate.",
    "This braid, which now alternate throbs",
    "With swelling hope and gloomy fear;",
    "This heart, with all the changing hues,",
    "That mortal passions bear\u2014",
    "This curious frame of human mould,",
    "Where unrequited cravings play,",
    "This brain, and heart, and wondrous form",
    "Must all alike decay.",
    "The leaping blood will stop its flow;",
    "The hoarse death-struggle pass; the cheek",
    "Lay bloomless, and the liquid tongue",
    "Will then forget to speak.",
    "The grave will tame me; earth will close",
    "O\u2019er cold dull limbs and ashy face;",
    "But where, O, Nature, where shall be",
    "The soul\u2019s abiding place?",
    "Will it e\u2019en live? For though its light",
    "shine till from the body torn;",
    "Then, when the oil of life is spent,",
    "Still shall the taper burn?",
    "O, powerless is this struggling brain",
    "To rend the mighty mystery;",
    "In dark, uncertain awe it waits",
    "The common doom, to die."

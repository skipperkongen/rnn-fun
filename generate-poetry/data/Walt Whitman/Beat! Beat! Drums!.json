    "Beat! beat! drums!\u2014blow! bugles! blow!",
    "Through the windows\u2014through doors\u2014burst like a ruthless force,",
    "Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,",
    "Into the school where the scholar is studying,",
    "Leave not the bridegroom quiet\u2014no happiness must he have now with his bride,",
    "Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,",
    "So fierce you whirr and pound you drums\u2014so shrill you bugles blow.",
    "Beat! beat! drums!\u2014blow! bugles! blow!",
    "Over the traffic of cities\u2014over the rumble of wheels in the streets;",
    "Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,",
    "No bargainers\u2019 bargains by day\u2014no brokers or speculators\u2014would they continue?",
    "Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?",
    "Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?",
    "Then rattle quicker, heavier drums\u2014you bugles wilder blow.",
    "Beat! beat! drums!\u2014blow! bugles! blow!",
    "Make no parley\u2014stop for no expostulation,",
    "Mind not the timid\u2014mind not the weeper or prayer,",
    "Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,",
    "Let not the child\u2019s voice be heard, nor the mother\u2019s entreaties,",
    "Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,",
    "So strong you thump O terrible drums\u2014so loud you bugles blow."

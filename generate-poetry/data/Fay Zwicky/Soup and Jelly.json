    "\u201cFeed Fred and sit with him",
    "and mind he doesn\u2019t walk about.",
    "He falls. Tell him his ute is safe",
    "back home. Thinks someone\u2019s pinched it,",
    "peers around the carpark all the time.",
    "His family brought him in it and",
    "he thinks it\u2019s gone.",
    "He was a farmer once . . .\u201d",
    "I take the tray. The ice-cream\u2019s almost",
    "melted round the crumbled orange jelly",
    "and the soup\u2019s too hot. I know",
    "I\u2019ll have to blow on it.",
    "Hunched, trapped behind a tray,",
    "he glances sideways, face as brown",
    "and caverned as the land itself,",
    "long thin lips droop ironic",
    "at the corners, gaunt nose.",
    "The blue and white pajamas cage",
    "the restless rangy legs.",
    "In and out they go, the feet",
    "in cotton socks feeling for the ground.",
    "\u201cAre you a foreigner?\u201d",
    "\u201cNot exactly. Just a little sunburnt,\u201d",
    "and I put the jelly down. I musn\u2019t feel",
    "a thing: my smile has come unstuck.",
    "I place a paper napkin on his lap. He winces.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re a foreigner all right,\u201d he says.",
    "\u201cOK,\u201d I say. What\u2019s one displacement more or less,",
    "wishing I were a hearty flat-faced Fenian",
    "with a perm and nothing doing in the belfry.",
    "Someone like his mother. Or a wife who",
    "spared him the sorrow of himself.",
    "Now he grabs the spoon. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d",
    "\u201cRight,\u201d I say, \u201cYou go ahead. Just ask me",
    "if you want some help.\u201d The tone\u2019s not right.",
    "I watch the trembling progress of the spoon",
    "for what seems years, paralysed with pity",
    "for his pride.",
    "How does a dark-faced woman give a man called Fred",
    "who cropped a farm and drove a battered ute",
    "a meal of soup and jelly?",
    "Outside the window, clouds are swelling",
    "into growing darkness and there\u2019s a man",
    "hard on his knees planting something in the rain."

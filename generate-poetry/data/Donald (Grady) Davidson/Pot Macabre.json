    "\u201cPress out an opiate juice",
    "From berries culled in prick of June-time heat;",
    "Pound nettles in a cruse",
    "Of crimson sard till mixing is complete;",
    "And strain the brew through bags of sarcenet,",
    "Mumbling the runes that crazed Sir Dagonet.\u201d",
    "So spoke the slobbering witch,",
    "Wagging her shaky head incessantly;",
    "Then, with an agile twitch",
    "Stove oddly crackling through the briery.",
    "I caught the swish of her broomstick up to the moon,",
    "And her tattered skirt afloat like a black balloon.",
    "Old Witch, whither art gone?",
    "Hopped off to the well like Chick-o\u2019-my-Craney-Crow?",
    "Here\u2019s work for thy dudgeon,",
    "A brew and a bake for a devilish calico!",
    "What\u2019s but a kettle ready for mad ferment,",
    "Black mouth a-grin at me, the innocent!",
    "I pressed and pounded duly,",
    "And sat to watch the slop at bubble slow;",
    "Fed coals with knots unruly",
    "Of thornbush boles till pot-legs stood aglow.",
    "And thrice the pot gave forth a piggish grunt,",
    "And thrice a bellowing as of hounds on hunt.",
    "A great red swine sprang out,",
    "With bristling gleams as bright as Freyr\u2019s boar;",
    "Then, at his grubbing snout,",
    "Two black dogs leaped, two white-fanged lusts for gore.",
    "They three made hideous noise through brush and dew\u2014",
    "Trembling I stooped and strained the mulling brew.",
    "And there was born a girl",
    "Within a sudden mist wizardry,",
    "And came some faint pipes\u2019 thirl,",
    "While she danced, with lips turned sly, and beckoned me,",
    "And we danced mad till night\u2019s low-burning wick",
    "Snuffed out, hearing like us the Old Hag\u2019s stick."

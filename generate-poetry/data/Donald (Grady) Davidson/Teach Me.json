    "Teach me, old World, your passion of slow change,",
    "Your calm of stars, watching the turn of earth,",
    "Patient of man, and never thinking strange",
    "The mad red crash of each new system\u2019s birth.",
    "Teach me, for I would know your beauty\u2019s way",
    "That waits and changes with each changing sun,",
    "No dawn so fair but promises a day",
    "Of other perfectness than men have won.",
    "Teach me, old World, not as vain men have taught,",
    "\u2014Unpatient song, nor words of hollow brass,",
    "Nor men\u2019s dismay whose powerfullest thought",
    "Is woe that they and worlds alike must pass.",
    "Nothing I learn by any mortal rule;",
    "Teach me, old World, I would not be man\u2019s fool."

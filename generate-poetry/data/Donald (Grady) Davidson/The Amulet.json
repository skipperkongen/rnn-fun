    "Thou twist of gold, woven so curiously,",
    "Be filled with warmth and urgent tenderness,",
    "And cool not on her throat\u2019s white nakedness,",
    "Like metal death, but burn insistently,",
    "Reminding her of me!",
    "To save her from the serpent\u2019s little eye",
    "I set a stone of blue chalcedony",
    "Within a cunning loop\u2014so it shall be",
    "Aware and mindful when her lashes lie",
    "Untaught of danger nigh.",
    "To keep her from the dragon\u2019s hungry tooth",
    "In seven laps the quorls were subtly twined;",
    "From seven rivers grains of gold were mined,",
    "Hammered by black elves\u2019 mauls, and tempered sooth",
    "In hissing brews uncouth.",
    "So lie within my satchel, Amulet,",
    "With many another dull and boughten thing,",
    "Till I am done with all my wandering",
    "And fix thee pendant on the carcanet",
    "Around her white neck set.",
    "For I have graven some small incantation",
    "In feathery lines upon this rounded wire\u2014",
    "King Solomon made such for his desire,",
    "And Sheba\u2019s throat was warm for subjugation",
    "Hearing the King\u2019s translation."

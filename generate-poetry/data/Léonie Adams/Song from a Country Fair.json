    "When tunes jigged nimbler than the blood",
    "And quick and high the bows would prance",
    "And every fiddle string would burst",
    "To catch what\u2019s lost beyond the string,",
    "While half afraid their children stood,",
    "I saw the old come out to dance.",
    "The heart is not so light at first,",
    "But heavy like a bough in spring."

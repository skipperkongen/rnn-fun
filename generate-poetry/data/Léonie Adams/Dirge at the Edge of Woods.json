    "Gold shed upon suckling gold,",
    "The time of the bole blackens,",
    "Of the dark mounted through dapple,",
    "While in the sealed apple",
    "The seed cradled toward cold.",
    "A gold on gold spent,",
    "Put by from an elm in its years",
    "Now its gilded of days,",
    "Over turf\u2019s dishevelment;",
    "Where all which is green sickens,",
    "All the fresh shall be sere.",
    "All which is green sickens,",
    "And it is but for a time",
    "Those embered veinings blaze",
    "A year\u2019s delirium;",
    "Or neared of other space,",
    "Unportioned azure shall close",
    "One of more, and which is,",
    "One which goes.",
    "Let the little pupils that will,",
    "Of vision, gaze for salt",
    "To whet their gazing, wit",
    "In one weather is high",
    "From burrow and lair, by",
    "Nether providences\u2019 default",
    "An all\u2019s accrued.",
    "And apposite, beyond",
    "Such primer beholdings, has",
    "Its long accounting known",
    "The beetle\u2019s morsel thus",
    "Was rich, and the slug\u2019s bed on",
    "The oak\u2019s generations, deep",
    "Over the lark\u2019s bones.",
    "In slough of Edens fast",
    "Wit in one weather shall stand,",
    "While millennia nibble at",
    "The sensual apple",
    "Toppled it net,",
    "Plenty in the palm of the hand,",
    "And the fallen not fallen, not lost",
    "From out its certitude\u2014",
    "For our unbeggaring",
    "Has been gross. Few and late",
    "To cherish an immoderate",
    "Wish, hope\u2019s calculus,",
    "Love\u2019s hope; few to miss,",
    "From natural tally thrust,",
    "In the lime-girdled space",
    "Of choice, where alone",
    "Man can abandon what",
    "Is only his own;",
    "And in cold and tarrying",
    "Their rearisers sleep:",
    "While to the granite cheek",
    "Light\u2019s purples bring",
    "Infinite their ministering,",
    "And past our finial",
    "And ragged crests, to keep",
    "Time\u2019s ambient stood,",
    "Propose horizons from",
    "Their shadowy quarries; while,",
    "In an unwandered wood,",
    "Or under the indifferent foot,",
    "Is let fall, let fall a fruit,",
    "Through eternal leisures down,",
    "For but time\u2019s unravelling."

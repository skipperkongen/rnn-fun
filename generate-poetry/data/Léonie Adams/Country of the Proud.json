    "A fall over rock,",
    "Metal answering to water,",
    "Is the seal of this spot;",
    "A land trodden by music",
    "And the tune forgot.",
    "Of a region savage,",
    "The territory that was broken,",
    "Silver gushed free;",
    "And earth holy, earth meek shall receive it",
    "In humility.",
    "This, not dwelt in, this haunted,",
    "The country of the proud,",
    "Is curdling to stone,",
    "And careless of the feet of the waters",
    "As they glance from it down."

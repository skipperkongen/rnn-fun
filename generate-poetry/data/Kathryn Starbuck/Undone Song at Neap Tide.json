    "When the sun and moon were in quadrature, when",
    "the garden had become a wilderness and the clock refused to strike",
    "When the old year died and the sand walked into",
    "the sea with the neap tide",
    "When you had been too long away and your old snowblue footprints",
    "clotted and hesitated in the clay",
    "When the worry of this undone song unsung so long",
    "so loud my head I went inside and under to let the flood run free"

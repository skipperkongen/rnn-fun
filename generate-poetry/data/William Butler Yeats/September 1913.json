    "What need you, being come to sense,",
    "But fumble in a greasy till",
    "And add the halfpence to the pence",
    "And prayer to shivering prayer, until",
    "You have dried the marrow from the bone;",
    "For men were born to pray and save:",
    "Romantic Ireland\u2019s dead and gone,",
    "It\u2019s with O\u2019Leary in the grave.",
    "Yet they were of a different kind,",
    "The names that stilled your childish play,",
    "They have gone about the world like wind,",
    "But little time had they to pray",
    "For whom the hangman\u2019s rope was spun,",
    "And what, God help us, could they save?",
    "Romantic Ireland\u2019s dead and gone,",
    "It\u2019s with O\u2019Leary in the grave.",
    "Was it for this the wild geese spread",
    "The grey wing upon every tide;",
    "For this that all that blood was shed,",
    "For this Edward Fitzgerald died,",
    "And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,",
    "All that delirium of the brave?",
    "Romantic Ireland\u2019s dead and gone,",
    "It\u2019s with O\u2019Leary in the grave.",
    "Yet could we turn the years again,",
    "And call those exiles as they were",
    "In all their loneliness and pain,",
    "You\u2019d cry, \u2018Some woman\u2019s yellow hair",
    "Has maddened every mother\u2019s son\u2019:",
    "They weighed so lightly what they gave.",
    "But let them be, they\u2019re dead and gone,",
    "They\u2019re with O\u2019Leary in the grave."

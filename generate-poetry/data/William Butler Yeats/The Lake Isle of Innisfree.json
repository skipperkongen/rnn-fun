    "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,",
    "And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;",
    "Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,",
    "And live alone in the bee-loud glade.",
    "And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,",
    "Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;",
    "There midnight\u2019s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,",
    "And evening full of the linnet\u2019s wings.",
    "I will arise and go now, for always night and day",
    "I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;",
    "While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,",
    "I hear it in the deep heart\u2019s core."

    "I met the Bishop on the road",
    "And much said he and I.",
    "`Those breasts are flat and fallen now",
    "Those veins must soon be dry;",
    "Live in a heavenly mansion,",
    "Not in some foul sty.'",
    "`Fair and foul are near of kin,",
    "And fair needs foul,' I cried.",
    "'My friends are gone, but that's a truth",
    "Nor grave nor bed denied,",
    "Learned in bodily lowliness",
    "And in the heart's pride.",
    "`A woman can be proud and stiff",
    "When on love intent;",
    "But Love has pitched his mansion in",
    "The place of excrement;",
    "For nothing can be sole or whole",
    "That has not been rent.'"

    "Just seen, running, and silver-gray",
    "along the top tube of a fence between myrtles and me,",
    "too slinky for a bird and even at this distance",
    "unmistakably a quadruped and",
    "nimble, some sort of unspoiled animal, but which?",
    "It ran as if away",
    "from a threat, peril was everywhere,",
    "a footsole crunches it, it is mangled",
    "by a tire\u2019s treads, hawk scoops it, turkey buzzard",
    "pecks at it, no speech mitigates its pains,",
    "even the cat fools with it, until, inedible,",
    "it is kicked into the gutter. There she goes,",
    "the slinky silver-gray Atalanta of reptiles",
    "vanishes in no time, for the wind",
    "whisks from her feet such tenuous gusts of air \u2014",
    "brisk now where turnpikes stretch their webs,",
    "and not forever can an earthiness",
    "so sweet as this propel such grace.",
    "She\u2019ll have got to the mantis eggs by now,",
    "at each gulp of hatchling",
    "she slowly blinks with satisfaction."

    "Knives and forks, print, street signs.",
    "Then, his mind made up, he laid about,",
    "Sank immense nets into the cultural acid.",
    "When we winched them back in, on fingertips,",
    "They rippled with rainbows\u2014herring and sprat",
    "He could fling, raw, in the teeth",
    "Of",
    ", God rot it. Ah, no God:",
    "So to invoke the impact of quanta on quanta",
    "And extirpate for keeps the German cabbage,",
    "His fingers, subject to whim, and rounded",
    "Like objects in a metephor, made good the feeble",
    "Peering eyes. Each tip housed a labyrinth,",
    "Circling in or out, from ivories an octopod",
    "Pressed the torrent of a tune. From Cretan pots",
    "Their gestures, snaking out, apprehended,",
    "Turn on turn, a tumbril in the stars.",

    "Brainwaves, on a page one trouser leg",
    "Segregated from his knee. What a joy,",
    "At long last, to know the knower not deceived",
    "But disobedient, at his word. Underneath",
    "The creams of language here\u2019s a tongue can taste",
    "A universe, cyclopic, but propulsive, alien",
    "To a species blocked by self-torment,",
    "To shopping, authority\u2014all the cockahoop",
    "Engines of flesh not fuelled by despair.",
    "When Nietzche, squinting, trimmed his fingernails,",
    "Did he care for suchlike slighter things?",
    "To a turning pot a potter\u2019s fingers do not cling."

    "I swear that I would not go back",
    "To pole the glass fishpools where the rough breath lies",
    "That built the Earth \u2013 there, under the heavy trees",
    "With their bark that\u2019s full of grocer\u2019s spice,",
    "Moves, thirstily, to drink the thought \u2013 would I",
    "Go back to run my boat",
    "On the brown rain that made it slippery,",
    "Return to ignorance, and be the wildfowl",
    "Thrown about by the dark water seasons",
    "With an ink-storm of dark moods against my soul,",
    "Only the breath of God that stirs",
    "Scent-kitchens of refreshing trees,",
    "And the shabby green cartilage of play upon my knees.",
    "To hold a Universe made out of breath,",
    "Slippery as fish with their wet mortar made of mirrors",
    "I laid a grip of glass upon my youth.",
    "To a Universe unreal as breath \u2013 although I use",
    "The great muscle of my heart",
    "To thirst like a drunkard for the scent-storm of the trees."

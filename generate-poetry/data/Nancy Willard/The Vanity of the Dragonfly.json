    "The dragonfly at rest on the doorbell\u2014",
    "too weak to ring and glad of it,",
    "but well mannered and cautious,",
    "thinking it best to observe us quietly",
    "before flying in, and who knows if he will find",
    "the way out? Cautious of traps, this one.",
    "A winged cross, plain, the body straight",
    "as a thermometer, the old glass kind",
    "that could kill us with mercury if our teeth",
    "did not respect its brittle body. Slim as an eel",
    "but a solitary glider, a pilot without bombs",
    "or weapons, and wings clear and small as a wish",
    "to see over our heads, to see the whole picture.",
    "And when our gaze grazes over it and moves on,",
    "the dragonfly changes its clothes,",
    "sheds its old skin, shriveled like laundry,",
    "and steps forth, polished black, with two",
    "circles buttoned like epaulettes taking the last space",
    "at the edge of its eyes."

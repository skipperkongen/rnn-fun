    "Most afternoons, I\u2019d run laps through Parc Brassens",
    "where grows the second smallest vineyard",
    "I have ever seen, and where those silver,",
    "pruned-back stalks looked blunt,",
    "strung-out on wires, and mostly dead",
    "all winter. That was how I saw them.",
    "That\u2019s all I expected. Even in the cold,",
    "I\u2019d see a guy my age there, once a week,",
    "playing his guitar. He\u2019d sit next to the bench",
    "where I\u2019d be stretching. He rarely spoke\u2014",
    "just to ask if I\u2019d like a song\u2014",
    "until the week before I left for good.",
    "I was sitting at the top of a hill",
    "about a hundred feet away from where",
    "if you stand tiptoe you can see the Eiffel Tower.",
    "He sat too close to me. We spoke of many things.",
    "Then he suggested we go at it right there,",
    "on the ground, under the sun. This is how",
    "one lives who knows that she will die:",
    "rolling in the arms of anyone when she can\u2014",
    "rolling in the arms of a musician\u2014aware",
    "that no one cares much what we do",
    "in little knolls behind reedy forsythia,",
    "in the middle of a Tuesday, in the middle",
    "of living. And I would know now",
    "how he felt, and the ground against me,",
    "and whether he was rough or sweet.",
    "And what is possible would widen every hour.",
    "Oh, but me, I thought I was immortal."

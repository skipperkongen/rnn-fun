    "Turning the corner, we discovered it",
    "just as the old wrought-iron lamps went on\u2014",
    "a quiet, tree-lined street, only one block long",
    "resting between the noisy avenues.",
    "The streetlamps splashed the shadows of the leaves",
    "across the whitewashed brick, and each tall window",
    "glowing through the ivy-decked facade",
    "promised lives as perfect as the light.",
    "Walking beneath the trees, we counted all",
    "the high black doors of houses bolted shut.",
    "And yet we could have opened any door,",
    "entered any room the evening offered.",
    "Or were we deluded by the strange",
    "equations of the light, the vagrant wind",
    "searching the trees, that we believed this brief",
    "conjunction of our separate lives was real?",
    "It seemed that moment lingered like a ghost,",
    "a flicker in the air, smaller than a moth,",
    "a curl of smoke flaring from a match,",
    "haunting a world it could not touch or hear.",
    "There should have been a greeting or a sign,",
    "the smile of a stranger, something beyond",
    "the soft refusals of the summer air",
    "and children trading secrets on the steps.",
    "Traffic bellowed from the avenue.",
    "Our shadows moved across the street\u2019s long wall,",
    "and at the end what else could I have done",
    "but turn the corner back into my life?"

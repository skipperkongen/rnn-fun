    "California night. The Devil\u2019s wind,",
    "the Santa Ana, blows in from the east,",
    "raging through the canyon like a drunk",
    "screaming in a bar.",
    "The air tastes like",
    "a stubbed-out cigarette. But why complain?",
    "The weather\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t breathe.",
    "Just lean back on the sweat-stained furniture,",
    "lights turned out, windows shut against the storm,",
    "and count your blessings.",
    "Another sleepless night,",
    "when every wrinkle in the bedsheet scratches",
    "like a dry razor on a sunburned cheek,",
    "when even ten-year whiskey tastes like sand,",
    "and quiet women in the kitchen run",
    "their fingers on the edges of a knife",
    "and eye their husbands\u2019 necks. I wish them luck.",
    "Tonight it seems that if I took the coins",
    "out of my pocket and tossed them in the air",
    "they\u2019d stay a moment glistening like a net",
    "slowly falling through dark water.",
    "I remember",
    "the headlights of the cars parked on the beach,",
    "the narrow beams dissolving on the dark",
    "surface of the lake, voices arguing",
    "about the forms, the crackling radio,",
    "the sheeted body lying on the sand,",
    "the trawling net still damp beside it. No,",
    "she wasn\u2019t beautiful\u2014but at that age",
    "when youth itself becomes a kind of beauty\u2014",
    "\u201cTaking good care of your clients, Marlowe?\u201d",
    "Relentlessly the wind blows on. Next door",
    "catching a scent, the dogs begin to howl.",
    "Lean, furious, raw-eyed from the storm,",
    "packs of coyotes come down from the hills",
    "where there is nothing left to hunt."

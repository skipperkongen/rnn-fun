    "he dived from the highest board",
    "curving down into salt and urine",
    "his cry fading out",
    "through the half century it took",
    "to hear as a child that a glass eel",
    "had been seen",
    "entering the seawater baths at twilight \u2014",
    "also known as",
    "\u2014",
    "and immediately",
    "the word begins",
    "a delicate migration \u2014",
    "a fine crazing healing in the tiles \u2014",
    "the sky deepening above a city",
    "that has always been",
    "unsettled between sluice gates and the Irish Sea",
    "to which there now comes at dusk",
    "a translucent visitor",
    "yearning for the estuary."

    "I have two daughters.",
    "They are all I ever wanted from the earth.",
    "Or almost all.",
    "I also wanted one piece of ground:",
    "One city trapped by hills. One urban river.",
    "An island in its element.",
    "So I could say",
    "And mean it.",
    "Now they are grown up and far away",
    "and memory itself",
    "has become an emigrant,",
    "wandering in a place",
    "where love dissembles itself as landscape:",
    "Where the hills",
    "are the colours of a child's eyes,",
    "where my children are distances, horizons:",
    "At night,",
    "on the edge of sleep,",
    "I can see the shore of Dublin Bay.",
    "Its rocky sweep and its granite pier.",
    "Is this, I say",
    "how they must have seen it,",
    "backing out on the mailboat at twilight,",
    "shadows falling",
    "on everything they had to leave?",
    "And would love forever?",
    "And then",
    "I imagine myself",
    "at the landward rail of that boat",
    "searching for the last sight of a hand.",
    "I see myself",
    "on the underworld side of that water,",
    "the darkness coming in fast, saying",
    "all the names I know for a lost land:"

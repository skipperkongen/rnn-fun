    "Here at the wolf\u2019s throat, at the egress of the howl,",
    "all along the avenue of deer-blink and salmon-kick",
    "where the spider lets its microphone down",
    "into the cave of the blackberry bush\u2014earth echo,",
    "absence of the human voice\u2014wait here",
    "with a bee on your wrist and a fly on your cheek,",
    "the tiny sun and tiny eclipse.",
    "It is time to be grateful for the breath",
    "of what you could crush without thought,",
    "a moth, a child\u2019s love, your own life.",
    "There might never be another chance.",
    "How did you find me, the astonished mother says",
    "to her four-year-old boy who\u2019d disappeared",
    "in the crowds at the music festival.",
    "I followed my heart, he shrugs,",
    "so matter-of-fact you might not see",
    "behind his words",
    "(o hover and feed, but not too long)",
    "the bee trails turning to ice as they\u2019re flown."

    "A basket of apples brown in our kitchen,",
    "their warm scent is the scent of ripening,",
    "and my sister, entering the room quietly,",
    "takes a seat at the table, takes up the task",
    "of peeling slowly away the blemished skins,",
    "even half-rotten ones are salvaged carefully.",
    "She makes sure to carve out the mealy flesh.",
    "For this, I am grateful. I explain,",
    "She smiles at me,",
    "and before long, the empty bowl she uses fills,",
    "domed with thin slices she brushes into",
    "the mouth of a steaming pot on the stove.",
    "I ask finally.",
    "she says,"

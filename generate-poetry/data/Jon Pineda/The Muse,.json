    "On the tip of a hill, the silhouette is of something not of this world,",
    "the body silent in the birth of another shadow, swelling still",
    "among stars & veins. The sun dropping below the mountains left",
    "hardly any light, except what glimmers on the membrane & slips",
    "into the high grass. Alone, I pulled over to the side",
    "of 81 where semis\u2019 blowing horns descend",
    "beyond the sloped field. Pieces of barbed wire snapped from the line.",
    "I stepped through the fence, its blood-colored rust rubbed into my hands.",
    "For a moment, it is something that stays with me, like a memory",
    "that does not give up easily. I try wiping my hands onto my jeans, but nothing.",
    "It is anything it wants to be\u2014calf, half-life, angel\u2014its fur a glaze",
    "of cricket sounds & cool air, a thing of stars burnt into hooves, a haze,",
    "& I stood there, not knowing whether it would be right to touch the one",
    "not breathing, its nose drying in the grass next to my hands, grit",
    "in the creases & burning now with the dust of splinters. Like flies,",
    "my fingers hover over the dead face."

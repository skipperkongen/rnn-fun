    "The coast hills at Sovranes Creek;",
    "No trees, but dark scant pasture drawn thin",
    "Over rock shaped like flame;",
    "The old ocean at the land\u2019s foot, the vast",
    "Gray extension beyond the long white violence;",
    "A herd of cows and the bull",
    "Far distant, hardly apparent up the dark slope;",
    "And the gray air haunted with hawks:",
    "This place is the noblest thing I have ever seen. No imaginable",
    "Human presence here could do anything",
    "But dilute the lonely self-watchful passion."

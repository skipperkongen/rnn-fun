    "Chronos, Chronos, mend thy pace,",
    "An hundred times the rolling sun",

    "Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha! well hast thou done,",
    "To lay down thy pack,",
    "And lighten thy back.",
    "The world was a fool, e'er since it begun,",
    "And since neither Janus, nor Chronos, nor I,",
    "Can hinder the crimes,",
    "Or mend the bad times,",
    "'Tis better to laugh than to cry.",
    "CHORUS OF ALL THREE",
    "JANUS",

    "With horns and with hounds I waken the day,",
    "And hie to my woodland walks away;",
    "I tuck up my robe, and am buskin'd soon,",
    "And tie to my forehead a waxing moon.",
    "I course the fleet stag, unkennel the fox,",
    "And chase the wild goats o'er summits of rocks,",
    "With shouting and hooting we pierce thro' the sky;",
    "And Echo turns hunter, and doubles the cry.",

    "JANUS",

    "And peace, the lazy good, is fled.",
    "Plenty, peace, and pleasure fly;",
    "The sprightly green",
    "In woodland-walks, no more is seen;",
    "The sprightly green, has drunk the Tyrian dye.",

    "MARS",
    "Sound the trumpet, beat the drum,",
    "Through all the world around;",

    "You charm'd me not with that fair face",
    "Though it was all divine:",
    "To be another's is the grace,",
    "That makes me wish you mine.",
    "The Gods and Fortune take their part",
    "Who like young monarchs fight;",
    "And boldly dare invade that heart",
    "Which is another's right.",
    "First mad with hope we undertake",
    "To pull up every bar;",
    "But once possess'd, we faintly make",
    "A dull defensive war.",
    "Now every friend is turn'd a foe",
    "In hope to get our store:",
    "And passion makes us cowards grow,",
    "Which made us brave before."

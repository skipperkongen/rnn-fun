    "When I saw one of those men touch your hair,",
    "I heard for the first time in many a year",
    "the ancient battle trumpets and I saw",
    "the banners of an army winding off to war",
    "and felt that blind power urging me to knock",
    "him out with one punch, send him tumbling to the floor.",
    "If nobody had held me back, stopped me,",
    "I would\u2014God help me\u2014have killed him on the spot,",
    "stomped out his blood, and spit in it. I'm sorry,",
    "but you must be aware your winding hair",
    "is different now, a hornets' nest, a snakes' lair!",
    "Yes, like a ball of snakes in a flower basket, dear."

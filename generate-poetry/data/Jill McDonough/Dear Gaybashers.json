    "Dear bashers, you should have seen the hot dog hit my neck,",

    "Josey and Rusty and Bob make fun of the gaybashers, and I",
    "wash my scarf in the sink. I use Woolite. We worry",
    "about insurance, interest rates. Not hot dogs thrown from F-150s,",
    "homophobic freaks. After the bashing, we used the ATM",
    "in the sex shop next to Annie's Social Club, smiled at the kind",
    "owner, his handlebar mustache. Astrud Gilberto sang",
    "... and the dildos",
    "gleamed from the walls, a hundred cheerful colors. In San Francisco",
    "it rains hot dogs, pity-the-fool. Ass-sized penguins, cock after cock in",
    "azure acrylic, butterscotch glass, anyone's flesh-tone, chrome."

    "Winter. Time to eat fat",
    "and watch hockey. In the pewter mornings, the cat,",
    "a black fur sausage with yellow",
    "Houdini eyes, jumps up on the bed and tries",
    "to get onto my head. It\u2019s his",
    "way of telling whether or not I\u2019m dead.",
    "If I\u2019m not, he wants to be scratched; if I am",
    "He\u2019ll think of something. He settles",
    "on my chest, breathing his breath",
    "of burped-up meat and musty sofas,",
    "purring like a washboard. Some other tomcat,",
    "not yet a capon, has been spraying our front door,",
    "declaring war. It\u2019s all about sex and territory,",
    "which are what will finish us off",
    "in the long run. Some cat owners around here",
    "should snip a few testicles. If we wise",
    "hominids were sensible, we\u2019d do that too,",
    "or eat our young, like sharks.",
    "But it\u2019s love that does us in. Over and over",
    "again,",
    "and famine",
    "crouches in the bedsheets, ambushing the pulsing",
    "eiderdown, and the windchill factor hits",
    "thirty below, and pollution pours",
    "out of our chimneys to keep us warm.",
    "February, month of despair,",
    "with a skewered heart in the centre.",
    "I think dire thoughts, and lust for French fries",
    "with a splash of vinegar.",
    "Cat, enough of your greedy whining",
    "and your small pink bumhole.",
    "Off my face! You\u2019re the life principle,",
    "more or less, so get going",
    "on a little optimism around here.",
    "Get rid of death. Celebrate increase. Make it be spring."

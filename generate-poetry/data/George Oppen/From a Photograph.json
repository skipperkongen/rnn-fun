    "Around my head, hugging with her whole arms,",

    "The apple in her hand\u2014her apple and her father,",
    "and my nose pressed",

    "We fall from, where would be bramble,",
    "Brush, bramble in the young Winter",
    "With its blowing snow she must have thought",
    "Was ours to give to her."

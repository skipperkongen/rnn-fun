    "The householder issuing to the street",
    "Is adrift a moment in that ice stiff",
    "Exterior. \u2018Peninsula",
    "Low lying in the bay",
    "And wooded\u2014\u2019 Native now",
    "Are the welder and the welder\u2019s arc",
    "In the subway\u2019s iron circuits:",
    "We have not escaped each other,",
    "Not in the forest, not here. The crippled girl hobbles",
    "Painfully in the new depths",
    "Of the subway, and painfully",
    "We shift our eyes. The bare rails",
    "And black walls contain",
    "Labor before her birth, her twisted",
    "Precarious birth and the men",
    "Laborious, burly\u2014She sits",
    "Quiet, her eyes still. Slowly,",
    "Deliberately she sees",
    "An anchor\u2019s blunt fluke sink",
    "Thru coins and coin machines,",
    "The ancient iron and the voltage",
    "In the iron beneath us in the child\u2019s deep",
    "Harbors into harbor sand."

    "the king said",
    "Looking at the ground;",
    "But we drive",
    "A Sunday paradise",
    "Of parkway, trees flow into trees and the grass",
    "Like water by the very asphalt crown",
    "And summit of things",
    "In the flow of traffic",
    "The family cars, in the dim",
    "Sound of the living",
    "The noise of increase to which we owe",
    "What we possess. We cannot reconcile ourselves.",
    "No one is reconciled, tho we spring",
    "From the ground together\u2014",
    "And we saw the seed,",
    "The minuscule Sequoia seed",
    "In the museum by the tremendous slab",
    "Of the tree. And imagined the seed",
    "In soil and the growth quickened",
    "So that we saw the seed reach out, forcing",
    "Earth thru itself into bark, wood, the green",
    "Needles of a redwood until the tree",
    "Stood in the room without soil\u2014",
    "How much of the earth's",
    "Crust has lived",
    "The seed\u2019s violence!",
    "The shock is metaphysical.",
    "For the wood weathers. Drift wood",
    "And the foot print in the forest grow older.",
    "This is not our time, not what we mean, it is a time",
    "Passing, the curl at the cutwater,",
    "The enormous prow",
    "Outside in the weather. In that breeze,",
    "The sense of that passage,",
    "Is desertion,",
    "Betrayal, that we are not innocent",
    "Of loneliness as Pierrot, Pierrette chattering",
    "Unaware tho we imagine nothing",
    "Beyond the streets of the living\u2014",
    "A sap in the limbs. Mary,",
    "Mary, we turn to the children",
    "As they will turn to the children",
    "Wanting so much to have created happiness",
    "As if a stem to the leaves\u2014",
    "\u2014we had camped in scrub,",
    "A scrub of the past, the fringes of towns",
    "Neither towns nor forest, nothing ours. And Linda five,",
    "Maybe six when the mare grazing",
    "In the meadow came to her.",
    "\u2018Horse,\u2019 she said, whispering",
    "By the roadside",
    "With the cars passing. Little girl welcomed,",
    "Learning welcome. The rest is\u2014",
    "Whatever\u2014whatever\u2014remote",
    "Mechanics, endurance,",
    "The piers of the city",
    "In the sea. Here are whole buildings",
    "Razed, whole blocks",
    "Of a city gone",
    "Among old streets",
    "And the old boroughs, ourselves",
    "Among these streets where Petra beat",
    "A washpan out her window gathering",
    "A crowd like a rescue. Relief,",
    "As they said it, The Relief. Petra",
    "Decisive suddenly among her children",
    "In those crumbling bedrooms, Petra,",
    "Petra\u2014. And how imagine it? or imagine",
    "Coughlin in the streets,",
    "Pelley and the Silver Shirts? The medieval sense seems innocent, the very",
    "Ceremony of innocence that was drowned.",
    "It was not. But how imagine it",
    "Of streets boarded and vacant where no time will hatch",
    "Now chairs and walls,",
    "Floors, roofs, the joists and beams,",
    "The woodwork, window sills",
    "In sun in a great weight of brick."

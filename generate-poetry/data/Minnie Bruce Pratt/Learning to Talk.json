    "On Magnolia Avenue there are no magnolias. Someone bought",
    "the house of the one survivor. All morning I heard the chainsaw",
    "sever its limbs from root to bud. No more scattered flowers, star city.",
    "No pink galaxy. Now the yard is a parking space, one Jeep SUV,",
    "one older car. Next door a woman comes out, late afternoon,",
    "a child in her arms. She speaks low, as if there\u2019s just the two of them.",
    "She says to him,",
    "and he listens to",
    "the common sparrows talking in the hedge. He listens as they argue",
    "back and forth, their dialect of nature, as the street clatters with commuters",
    "taking a shortcut home. She says:",
    "And he turns his head to follow",
    "the fugitive motion, the small streaked wings unfolding, folding,",
    "the relentless chirp from a tiny blunt beak, the sound almost within reach."

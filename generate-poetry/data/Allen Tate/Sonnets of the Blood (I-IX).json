    "What is the flesh and blood compounded of",
    "But a few moments in the life of time?",
    "This prowling of the cells, litigious love,",
    "Wears the long claw of flesh-arguing crime.",
    "Consider the first settlers of our bone,",
    "Observe how busily they sued the dust,",
    "Estopped forever by the last dusted stone.",
    "It is a pity that two brothers must",
    "Perceive a canker of perennial flower",
    "To make them brothers in mortality:",
    "Perfect this treason to the murderous hour",
    "If you would win the hard identity",
    "Of brothers\u2014a long race for men to run",
    "Nor quite achieved when the perfection\u2019s won.",
    "Near to me as perfection in the blood",
    "And more mysterious far, is this, my brother:",
    "A light vaulted into your solitude.",
    "It studied burns lest you its rage should smother.",
    "It is a flame obscure to any eyes,",
    "Most like the fire that warms the deepest grave",
    "(The cold grave is the deepest of our lies)",
    "To which our blood is the indentured slave:",
    "The fire that burns most secretly in you",
    "Does not expend you hidden and alone,",
    "The studious fire consumes not one, but two\u2014",
    "Me also, marrowing the self-same bone.",
    "Our property in fire is death in life",
    "Flawing the rocky fundament with strife.",
    "Then, brother, you would never think me vain",
    "Or rude, if I should mention dignity;",
    "Think little of it. Dignity\u2019s the stain",
    "Of mortal sin that knows humility.",
    "Let me design the hour when you were born",
    "Since, if that\u2019s vain, it\u2019s only childlike so:",
    "Like an attempting frost on April corn",
    "Considerate death would hardly let you go.",
    "Reckon the cost\u2014if you would validate",
    "Once more our slavery to circumstance",
    "Not by contempt of a prescriptive fate",
    "But in your bearing towards an hour of chance.",
    "It is a part so humble and so proud",
    "You\u2019ll think but little of it in your shroud.",
    "The times have changed. Why do you make a fuss",
    "For privilege when there\u2019s no law of form?",
    "Who of our kin was pusillanimous,",
    "A fine bull galloping into a storm?",
    "Why, none; unless you count it arrogance",
    "To cultivate humility in pride,",
    "To look but casually and half-askance",
    "On boots and spurs that went a devil\u2019s ride.",
    "There was, remember, a Virginian",
    "Who took himself to be brute nature\u2019s law,",
    "Cared little what men thought him, a tall man",
    "Who meditated calmly what he saw",
    "Until he freed his Negroes, lest he be",
    "Too strict with nature and than they less free.",
    "Our elder brother whom we had not seen",
    "These twenty years until you brought him back",
    "From the cyclonic West, where he had been",
    "Sent by the shaking fury in the track",
    "We know so well, wound in these arteries:",
    "You, other brother, I have become strange",
    "To you, and you must study ways to seize",
    "Mortality, that knows how to derange",
    "Corpuscles for designs that it may choose;",
    "Your blood is altered by the sudden death",
    "Of one who of all persons could not use",
    "Life half so well as death. Let\u2019s look beneath",
    "That life. Perhaps hers only is our rest\u2014",
    "To study this, all lifetime may be best.",
    "The fire I praise was once perduring flame\u2014",
    "Till it snuffs with our generation out;",
    "No matter, it\u2019s all one, it\u2019s but a name",
    "Not as late honeysuckle half so stout;",
    "So think upon it how the fire burns blue,",
    "Its hottest, when the flame is all but spent;",
    "Thank God the fuel is low, we\u2019ll not renew",
    "That length of flame into our firmament;",
    "Think too the rooftree crackles and will fall",
    "On us, who saw the sacred fury\u2019s height\u2014",
    "Seated in her tall chair, with the black shawl",
    "From head to foot, burning with motherly light",
    "More spectral than November dusk could mix",
    "With sunset, to blaze on her pale crucifix.",
    "This message hastens lest we both go down",
    "Scattered, with no character, to death;",
    "Death is untutored, with an ignorant frown",
    "For precious identities of breath.",
    "But you perhaps will say confusion stood,",
    "A vulture, near the heart of all our kin:",
    "I\u2019ve heard the echoes in a dark tangled wood",
    "Yet never saw I a face peering within.",
    "These evils being anonymities,",
    "We fulminate, in exile from the earth,",
    "Aged exclusions of blood memories\u2014",
    "Those superstitions of explosive birth;",
    "Until there\u2019ll be of us not anything",
    "But foolish death, who is confusion\u2019s king.",
    "Not power nor the casual hand of God",
    "Shall keep us whole in our dissevering air,",
    "It is a stink upon this pleasant sod",
    "So foul, the hovering buzzard sees it fair;",
    "I ask you will it end therefore tonight",
    "And the moth tease again the windy flame,",
    "Or spiders, eating their loves, hide in the night",
    "At last, drowsy with self-devouring shame?",
    "Call it the house of Atreus where we live\u2014",
    "Which one of us the Greek perplexed with crime",
    "Questions the future: bring that lucid sieve",
    "To strain the appointed particles of time!",
    "Whether by Corinth or by Thebes we go",
    "The way is brief, but the fixed doom, not so.",
    "Captains of industry, your aimless power",
    "Awakens harsh velleities of time:",
    "Let you, brother, captaining your hour",
    "Be zealous that your numbers are all prime,",
    "Lest false division with sly mathematic",
    "Plunder the inner mansion of the blood,",
    "The Thracian, swollen with pride, besiege the Attic\u2014",
    "Invader foraging the sacred wood:",
    "Yet the prime secret whose simplicity",
    "Your towering engine hammers to reduce,",
    "Though driven, holds that bulwark of the sea",
    "Which breached will turn unspeaking fury loose",
    "To drown out him who swears to rectify",
    "Infinity, that has nor ear nor eye."

    "In a pyloned desert where the scorpion reigns",
    "My love and I plucked poppies breathing tales",
    "Of crimes now long asleep, whose once\u2013red stains",
    "Dyed stabbing men, at sea with bloody sails.",
    "The golden sand drowsed. There a dog yelped loud;",
    "And in his cry rattled a hollow note",
    "Of deep uncanny knowledge of that crowd",
    "That loved and bled in winy times remote.",
    "The poppies fainted when the moon came wide;",
    "The cur lay still. Our passionate review",
    "Of red wise folly dreamed on . . . She by my side",
    "Stared at the Moon; and then I knew he knew.",
    "And then he smiled at",
    "; to him \u2019twas funny\u2014",
    "Her calm steel eyes, her earth\u2013old throat of honey!"

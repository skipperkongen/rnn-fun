    "Black reapers with the sound of steel on stones",
    "Are sharpening scythes. I see them place the hones",
    "In their hip-pockets as a thing that\u2019s done,",
    "And start their silent swinging, one by one.",
    "Black horses drive a mower through the weeds,",
    "And there, a field rat, startled, squealing bleeds.",
    "His belly close to ground. I see the blade,",
    "Blood-stained, continue cutting weeds and shade."

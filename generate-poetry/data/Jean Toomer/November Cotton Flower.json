    "Boll-weevil\u2019s coming, and the winter\u2019s cold,",
    "Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,",
    "And cotton, scarce as any southern snow,",
    "Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,",
    "Failed in its function as the autumn rake;",
    "Drouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take",
    "All water from the streams; dead birds were found",
    "In wells a hundred feet below the ground\u2014",
    "Such was the season when the flower bloomed.",
    "Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed",
    "Significance. Superstition saw",
    "Something it had never seen before:",
    "Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,",
    "Beauty so sudden for that time of year."

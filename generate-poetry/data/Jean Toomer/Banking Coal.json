    "Whoever it was who brought the first wood and coal",
    "To start the Fire, did his part well;",
    "Not all wood takes to fire from a match,",
    "Nor coal from wood before it\u2019s burned to charcoal.",
    "The wood and coal in question caught a flame",
    "And flared up beautifully, touching the air",
    "That takes a flame from anything.",
    "Somehow the fire was furnaced,",
    "And then the time was ripe for some to say,",
    "\u201cRight banking of the furnace saves the coal.\u201d",
    "I\u2019ve seen them set to work, each in his way,",
    "Though all with shovels and with ashes,",
    "Never resting till the fire seemed most dead;",
    "Whereupon they\u2019d crawl in hooded night-caps",
    "Contentedly to bed. Sometimes the fire left alone",
    "Would die, but like as not spiced tongues",
    "Remaining by the hardest on till day would flicker up,",
    "Never strong, to anyone who cared to rake for them.",
    "But roaring fires never have been made that way.",
    "I\u2019d like to tell those folks that one grand flare",
    "Transferred to memory tissues of the air",
    "Is worth a like, or, for dull minds that turn in gold,",
    "All money ever saved by banking coal."

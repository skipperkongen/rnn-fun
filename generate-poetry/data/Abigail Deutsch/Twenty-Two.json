    "I walked to the baker\u2019s",
    "and thought about the bread.",
    "And at the corner store",
    "the butter. Four kinds of butter!",
    "I bought them in order",
    "of saltiness. I studied slang",
    "in secret. I said little.",
    "And my students were",
    "so beautiful",
    "I couldn\u2019t teach a thing.",
    "Instead I made them sing.",
    "Twenty-two. Nothing to do.",
    "New York had vanished,",
    "Connecticut, too.",
    "My students grew hair",
    "and got haircuts, grew hair",
    "and got haircuts, and sang.",
    "I\u2019d lie in bed and masturbate",
    "and wonder why I\u2019d come,",
    "and come and come again",
    "and then rise for some bread and a run.",
    "Does the village persist? It must.",
    "Right now, someone hums \u201cNowhere Man\u201d",
    "and thinks of that shy teacher from \u2014",
    "Manhattan? New Orleans? Bel Air?",
    "And she brushes her lengthening hair."

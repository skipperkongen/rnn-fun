    "What was it like, God of mine, what was it like?",
    "\u2014Oh unfaithful heart, indecisive intelligence!",
    "Was it like the going by of the wind?",
    "Like the disappearance of the spring?",
    "As nimble, as changeable, as weightless",
    "as milkweed seeds in summer . . . Yes! Indefinite",
    "as a smile which is lost forever in a laugh . . .",
    "Arrogant in the air, just like a flag!",
    "Flag, smile, milkweed pod, swift",
    "spring in June, clear wind! . . .",
    "Your celebration was so wild, so sad!",
    "All of your changes ended up in nothing\u2014",
    "remembrance, a blind bee of bitter things!\u2014",
    "I don\u2019t know what you were like, but you were!"

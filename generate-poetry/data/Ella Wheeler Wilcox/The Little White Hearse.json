    "Somebody\u2019s baby was buried to-day\u2014",
    "The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back,",
    "And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and gay",
    "As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its way,",
    "And a shadow seemed drawn o\u2019er the sun\u2019s golden track.",
    "Somebody\u2019s baby was laid out to rest,",
    "White as a snowdrop, and fair to behold,",
    "And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast,",
    "And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed",
    "With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold.",
    "Somebody saw it go out of her sight,",
    "Under the coffin lid\u2014out through the door;",
    "Somebody finds only darkness and blight",
    "All through the glory of summer-sun light;",
    "Somebody\u2019s baby will waken no more.",
    "Somebody\u2019s sorrow is making me weep:",
    "I know not her name, but I echo her cry,",
    "For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep,",
    "The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep",
    "In the little white hearse that went rumbling by.",
    "I know not her name, but her sorrow I know;",
    "While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more,",
    "And back to my heart surged that river of woe",
    "That but in the breast of a mother can flow;",
    "For the little white hearse has been, too, at",
    "door."

    "If, when I die, I must be buried, let",
    "No cemetery engulph me \u2014 no lone grot,",
    "Where the great palpitating world comes not,",
    "Save when, with heart bowed down and eyelids wet,",
    "It pays its last sad melancholy debt",
    "To some outjourneying pilgrim. May my lot",
    "Be rather to lie in some much-used spot,",
    "Where human life, with all its noise and fret,",
    "Throbs on about me. Let the roll of wheels,",
    "With all earth\u2019s sounds of pleasure, commerce, love,",
    "And rush of hurrying feet surge o\u2019er my head.",
    "Even in my grave I shall be one who feels",
    "Close kinship with the pulsing world above;",
    "And too deep silence would distress me, dead."

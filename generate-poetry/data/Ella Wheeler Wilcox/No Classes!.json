    "No classes here! Why, that is idle talk.",
    "The village beau sneers at the country boor;",
    "The importuning mendicants who walk",
    "Our cites\u2019 streets despise the parish poor.",
    "The daily toiler at some noisy loom",
    "Holds back her garments from the kitchen aid.",
    "Meanwhile the latter leans upon her broom,",
    "Unconscious of the bow the laundress made.",
    "The grocer\u2019s daughter eyes the farmer\u2019s lass",
    "With haughty glances; and the lawyer\u2019s wife",
    "Would pay no visits to the trading class,",
    "If policy were not her creed in life.",
    "The merchant\u2019s son nods coldly at the clerk;",
    "The proud possessor of a pedigree",
    "Ignores the youth whose father rose by work;",
    "The title-seeking maiden scorns all three.",
    "The aristocracy of blood looks down",
    "Upon the \u201cnouveau riche\u201d; and in disdain,",
    "The lovers of the intellectual frown",
    "On both, and worship at the shrine of brain.",
    "\u201cNo classes here,\u201d the clergyman has said;",
    "\u201cWe are one family.\u201d Yet see his rage",
    "And horror when his favorite son would wed",
    "Some pure and pretty player on the stage.",
    "It is the vain but natural way",
    "Of vaunting our weak selves, our pride, our worth!",
    "Not till the long delayed millennial day",
    "Shall we behold \u201cno classes\u201d on God\u2019s earth."

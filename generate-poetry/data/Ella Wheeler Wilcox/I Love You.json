    "I love your lips when they\u2019re wet with wine",
    "And red with a wild desire;",
    "I love your eyes when the lovelight lies",
    "Lit with a passionate fire.",
    "I love your arms when the warm white flesh",
    "Touches mine in a fond embrace;",
    "I love your hair when the strands enmesh",
    "Your kisses against my face.",
    "Not for me the cold, calm kiss",
    "Of a virgin\u2019s bloodless love;",
    "Not for me the saint\u2019s white bliss,",
    "Nor the heart of a spotless dove.",
    "But give me the love that so freely gives",
    "And laughs at the whole world\u2019s blame,",
    "With your body so young and warm in my arms,",
    "It sets my poor heart aflame.",
    "So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth,",
    "Still fragrant with ruby wine,",
    "And say with a fervor born of the South",
    "That your body and soul are mine.",
    "Clasp me close in your warm young arms,",
    "While the pale stars shine above,",
    "And we\u2019ll live our whole young lives away",
    "In the joys of a living love."

    "Alone it stands in Poesy\u2019s fair land,",
    "A temple by the muses set apart;",
    "A perfect structure of consummate art,",
    "By artists builded and by genius planned.",
    "Beyond the reach of the apprentice hand,",
    "Beyond the ken of the unturtored heart,",
    "Like a fine carving in a common mart,",
    "Only the favored few will understand.",
    "A",
    "toiled over with great care,",
    "Yet which the unseeing careless crowd goes by,",
    "A plainly set, but well-cut solitaire,",
    "An ancient bit of pottery, too rare",
    "To please or hold aught save the special eye,",
    "These only with the sonnet can compare."

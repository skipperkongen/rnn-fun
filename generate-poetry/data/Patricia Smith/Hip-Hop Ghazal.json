    "decked out in shells and splashes, Lawdie, bringing them woo hips.",
    "As the jukebox teases, watch my sistas throat the heartbreak,",
    "inhaling bassline, cracking backbone and singing thru hips.",
    "Like something boneless, we glide silent, seeping 'tween floorboards,",
    "wrapping around the hims, and",
    ", clinging like glue hips.",
    "Engines grinding, rotating, smokin', gotta pull back some.",
    "Natural minds are lost at the mere sight of ringing true hips.",
    "Gotta love us girls, just struttin' down Manhattan streets",
    "killing the menfolk with a dose of that stinging view. Hips.",
    "Crying 'bout getting old\u2014Patricia, you need to get up off",

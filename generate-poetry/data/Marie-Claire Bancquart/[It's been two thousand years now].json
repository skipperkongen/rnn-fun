    "It's been two thousand years now that, with a wounded leg,",
    "the god's amazing loves have dragged along.",
    "He has aged. Soon",
    "he won't be noticed except from way up in a plane",
    "in the markings of wheat",
    "that yield the trace",
    "of an ancient sanctuary.",
    "He solicits a language of caresses,",
    "open pasture, available bodies,",
    "and the words refuse, and this elsewhere is already in his death",
    "except for a slender purple flower under the sun.",
    "He can still act the god all around,",
    "evening's worn heart.",
    "He guesses the flower will slip",
    "fragile",
    "from one century to the next with its prayer."

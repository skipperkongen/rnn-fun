    "The brightly-painted horse",
    "Had a boy\u2019s face,",
    "And four small wheels",
    "Under his feet,",
    "Plus a long string",
    "To pull him by this way and that",
    "Across the floor,",
    "Should you care to.",
    "A string in-waiting",
    "That slipped away",
    "In many wiles",
    "From each and every try.",
    "Knock and they\u2019ll answer,",
    "Mother told me.",
    "So I climbed four flights of stairs",
    "And went in unannounced.",
    "And found a small wooden toy",
    "For the taking",
    "In the ensuing emptiness",
    "And the fading daylight",
    "That still gives me a shudder",
    "As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.",
    "Where\u2019s the Lost and Found Department,",
    "And the quiet entry,",
    "The undeveloped film",
    "Of the few clear moments",
    "Of our blurred lives?",
    "Where\u2019s the drop of blood",
    "And the teeny nail",
    "That pricked my finger",
    "As I bent down to touch the toy",
    "And caught its eye?",
    "Evening light,",
    "Make me a Sunday",
    "Go-to meeting shadow",
    "For my toy.",
    "My dearest memories are",
    "Steep stair-wells",
    "In dusty buildings",
    "On dead-end streets,",
    "Where I talk to the walls",
    "And closed doors",
    "As if they understood me.",
    "The wooden toy sitting pretty.",
    "No, quieter than that.",
    "Like the sound of eyebrows",
    "Raised by a villain",
    "In a silent movie.",
    ", someone said behind my back."

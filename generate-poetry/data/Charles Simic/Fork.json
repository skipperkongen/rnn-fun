    "This strange thing must have crept",
    "Right out of hell.",
    "It resembles a bird\u2019s foot",
    "Worn around the cannibal\u2019s neck.",
    "As you hold it in your hand,",
    "As you stab with it into a piece of meat,",
    "It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:",
    "Its head which like your fist",
    "Is large, bald, beakless, and blind."

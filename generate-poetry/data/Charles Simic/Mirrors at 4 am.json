    "You must come to them sideways",
    "In rooms webbed in shadow,",
    "Sneak a view of their emptiness",
    "Without them catching",
    "A glimpse of you in return.",
    "The secret is,",
    "Even the empty bed is a burden to them,",
    "A pretense.",
    "They are more themselves keeping",
    "The company of a blank wall,",
    "The company of time and eternity",
    "Which, begging your pardon,",
    "Cast no image",
    "As they admire themselves in the mirror,",
    "While you stand to the side",
    "Pulling a hanky out",
    "To wipe your brow surreptitiously."

    "Great are the Hittites.",
    "Their ears have mice and mice have holes.",
    "Their dogs bury themselves and leave the bones",
    "To guard the house. A single weed holds all their storms",
    "Until the spiderwebs spread over the heavens.",
    "There are bits of straw in their lakes and rivers",
    "Looking for drowned men. When a camel won\u2019t pass",
    "Through the eye of one of their needles,",
    "They tie a house to its tail. Great are the Hittites.",
    "Their fathers are in cradles, their newborn make war.",
    "To them lead floats, a leaf sinks. Their god is the size",
    "Of a mustard seed so that he can be quickly eaten.",
    "They also piss against the wind,",
    "Pour water in a leaky bucket.",
    "Strike two tears to make fire,",
    "And have tongues with bones in them,",
    "Bones of a wolf gnawed by lambs.",
    "*",
    "They are also called mound builders,",
    "They are called Asiatic horses",
    "That will drink on the Rhine, they are called",
    "My grandmother\u2019s fortune-telling, they are called",
    "You can\u2019t take it to the grave with you.",
    "It\u2019s that hum in your left ear,",
    "A sigh coming from deep within you,",
    "A dream in which you keep falling forever,",
    "The hour in which you sit up in bed",
    "As though someone has shouted your name.",
    "No one knows why the Hittites exist,",
    "Still, when two are whispering",
    "One of them is listening.",
    "Did they catch the falling knife?",
    "They caught it like a fly with closed mouths.",
    "Did they balance the last egg?",
    "They struck the egg with a bone so it won\u2019t howl.",
    "Did they wait for dead man\u2019s shoes?",
    "The shoes went in at one ear and out the other.",
    "Did they wipe the blood from their mousetraps?",
    "They burnt the blood to warm themselves.",
    "Are they cold with no pockets in their shrouds?",
    "If the sky falls, they shall have clouds for supper.",
    "What do they have for us",
    "To put in our pipes and smoke?",
    "They have the braid of a beautiful girl",
    "That drew a team of cattle",
    "And the engraving of him who slept",
    "With dogs and rose with fleas",
    "Searching for its trace in the sky.",
    "*",
    "And so there are fewer and fewer of them now.",
    "Who wrote their name on paper",
    "And burnt the paper? Who put snake bones",
    "In their pillows? Who threw nail parings",
    "In their soup? Who made them walk",
    "Under the ladder? Who stuck pins",
    "In their snapshots?",
    "The wart of warts and his brother evil eye.",
    "Bone-lazy and her sister rabbit\u2019s-foot.",
    "Cross-your-fingers and their father dog star.",
    "Knock-on-wood and his mother hellfire.",
    "Because the tail can\u2019t wag the cow.",
    "Because the woods can\u2019t fly to the dove.",
    "Because the stones haven\u2019t said their last word.",
    "Because dunghills rise and empires fall.",
    "*",
    "They are leaving behind",
    "All the silver spoons",
    "Found inside their throats at birth,",
    "A hand they bit because it fed them,",
    "Two rats from a ship that is still sinking,",
    "A collection of various split hairs,",
    "The leaf they turned over too late.",
    "*",
    "All that salt cast over the shoulder,",
    "All that bloody meat traveling under the saddles of nomads ...",
    "Here comes a forest in wolf\u2019s clothing,",
    "The wise hen bows to the umbrella.",
    "When the bloodshot evening meets the bloodshot night,",
    "They tell each other bloodshot tales.",
    "That bare branch over them speaks louder than words.",
    "The moon is worn threadbare.",
    "I repeat: lean days don\u2019t come singly,",
    "It takes all kinds to make the sun rise.",
    "The night is each man\u2019s castle.",
    "Don\u2019t let the castle out of the bag.",
    "Wind in the valley, wind in the high hills,",
    "Practice will make this body fit this bed.",
    "*",
    "May all roads lead",
    "Out of a sow\u2019s ear",
    "To what\u2019s worth",
    "Two in the bush."

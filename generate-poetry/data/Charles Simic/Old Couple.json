    "They\u2019re waiting to be murdered,",
    "Or evicted. Soon",
    "They expect to have nothing to eat.",
    "In the meantime, they sit.",
    "A violent pain is coming, they think.",
    "It will start in the heart",
    "And climb into the mouth.",
    "They\u2019ll be carried off in stretchers, howling.",
    "Tonight they watch the window",
    "Without exchanging a word.",
    "It has rained, and now it looks",
    "Like it\u2019s going to snow a little.",
    "I see him get up to lower the shades.",
    "If their window stays dark,",
    "I know his hand has reached hers",
    "Just as she was about to turn on the lights."

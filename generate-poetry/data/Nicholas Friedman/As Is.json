    "Just north of town, a quaint Sargasso Sea",
    "for bric-a-brac: the barn, itself antique,",
    "spills over with a grab-bag panoply",
    "of outworn stock revalued as \u201cunique.\u201d",
    "Typewriters tall as headstones fill the loft",
    "where they\u2019ve been ricked away like sacks of grain;",
    "a coffer yawns the must of oak\u2014gone soft\u2014",
    "when one man, squinting, lifts the lid to feign",
    "intrigue. Nearby, his wife surveys the smalls:",
    "art deco bangles bright as harpsichords,",
    "a glut of iron trivets, Christmas balls,",
    "Depression glass and warping Ouija boards.",
    "One man\u2019s junk is another\u2019s all the same.",
    "They don\u2019t buy much, but that\u2019s not why they came."

    "Half clown, half Keebler elf, he works a throng",
    "of meth heads and young mothers who peruse",
    "the storefronts, tugging surly kids along.",
    "The pant legs bunch around his wing-tipped shoes.",
    "When a couple walks up to his TV tray,",
    "he hands them each a tattered business card.",
    "He grins and cuts a deck: His hands are scarred,",
    "but seldom shake. The two confer, agree,",
    "and fidget as the magician fans an arc",
    "of cherubs laced with flips of filigree.",
    "The man inspects them for a crease or mark,",
    "but they look clean. I\u2019ve watched him do this trick",
    "for weeks now, each time to polite surprise:",
    "He hams it up; he lays the charm on thick.",
    "(As always, haughty jacks materialize.)",
    "The woman smiles and nods in mild content.",
    "Another trick: He pulls a wrinkled bill",
    "from his lapel and folds the president,",
    "explaining how",
    "\u2014et cetera.",
    "He taps twice on the bill, a modest \u201cone,\u201d",
    "unfolds it square by square, and then",
    "\u2014",
    "the bust of Alexander Hamilton.",
    "They clap as the magician takes a bow.",
    "He\u2019s greasy, but he\u2019s on the up-and-up,",
    "and magic tricks are good enough for now.",
    "The woman floats a dollar to his cup."

    "is not turning the way you thought",
    "it would turn, gently, in a little spiral loop,",
    "the way a child draws the tail of a pig.",
    "What came out of your mouth,",
    "a riff of common talk.",
    "As a sudden weather shift on a beach,",
    "sky looming mountains of cloud",
    "in a way you cannot predict",
    "or guide, the story shuffles elements, darkens,",
    "takes its own side. And it is strange.",
    "Far more complicated than a few phrases",
    "pieced together around a kitchen table",
    "on a July morning in Dallas, say,",
    "a city you don\u2019t live in, where people",
    "might shop forever or throw a thousand stories",
    "away. You who carried or told a tiny bit of it",
    "aren\u2019t sure. Is this what we wanted?",
    "Stories wandering out,",
    "having their own free lives?",
    "Maybe they are planning something bad.",
    "A scrap or cell of talk you barely remember",
    "is growing into a weird body with many demands.",
    "One day soon it will stumble up the walk and knock,",
    "knock hard, and you will have to answer the door."

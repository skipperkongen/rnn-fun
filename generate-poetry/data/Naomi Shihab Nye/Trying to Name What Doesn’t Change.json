    "Roselva says the only thing that doesn\u2019t change",
    "is train tracks. She\u2019s sure of it.",
    "The train changes, or the weeds that grow up spidery",
    "by the side, but not the tracks.",
    "I\u2019ve watched one for three years, she says,",
    "and it doesn\u2019t curve, doesn\u2019t break, doesn\u2019t grow.",
    "Peter isn\u2019t sure. He saw an abandoned track",
    "near Sabinas, Mexico, and says a track without a train",
    "is a changed track. The metal wasn\u2019t shiny anymore.",
    "The wood was split and some of the ties were gone.",
    "Every Tuesday on Morales Street",
    "butchers crack the necks of a hundred hens.",
    "The widow in the tilted house",
    "spices her soup with cinnamon.",
    "Ask her what doesn\u2019t change.",
    "Stars explode.",
    "The rose curls up as if there is fire in the petals.",
    "The cat who knew me is buried under the bush.",
    "The train whistle still wails its ancient sound",
    "but when it goes away, shrinking back",
    "from the walls of the brain,",
    "it takes something different with it every time."

    "Thou God, whose high, eternal Love",
    "Is the only blue sky of our life,",
    "Clear all the Heaven that bends above",
    "The life-road of this man and wife.",
    "May these two lives be but one note",
    "In the world\u2019s strange-sounding harmony,",
    "Whose sacred music e\u2019er shall float",
    "Through every discord up to Thee.",
    "As when from separate stars two beams",
    "Unite to form one tender ray:",
    "As when two sweet but shadowy dreams",
    "Explain each other in the day:",
    "So may these two dear hearts one light",
    "Emit, and each interpret each.",
    "Let an angel come and dwell tonight",
    "In this dear double-heart, and teach."

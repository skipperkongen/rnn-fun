    "the termites had deboned the thing",
    "it was clean there was no saving it",
    "in one bedroom a dresser with blue drawers",
    "its peg-legs rested on pure membrane",
    "a girl just stood in her underwear",
    "ran the tips of her fingers over her ribs",
    "thought",
    "no one knew no explaining",
    "why she didn\u2019t fall through the floor",
    "the kids were drinking beer in the yard",
    "the tetherball rope caught one girl\u2019s throat",
    "her mother\u2019s face obscured",
    "behind the porch screen the mesquite shadow",
    "no one could make her out",
    "her feet rested on hot sashes of dust",
    "the sounds on the television were far away",
    "as that big caliche mound looked lake a waving man",
    "the president got shot",
    "the boards stayed together for another three days",
    "it was a matter of apathy or swelling",
    "or everyone was too hot to move"

    "APPLES",
    "Come buy my fine wares,",
    "Plums, apples and pears.",
    "A hundred a penny,",
    "In conscience too many:",
    "Come, will you have any?",
    "My children are seven,",
    "I wish them in Heaven;",
    "My husband\u2019s a sot,",
    "With his pipe and his pot,",
    "Not a farthen will gain them,",
    "And I must maintain them.",
    "ONIONS",
    "Come, follow me by the smell,",
    "Here are delicate onions to sell;",
    "I promise to use you well.",
    "They make the blood warmer,",
    "You\u2019ll feed like a farmer;",
    "For this is every cook\u2019s opinion,",
    "No savoury dish without an onion;",
    "But, lest your kissing should be spoiled,",
    "Your onions must be thoroughly boiled:",
    "Or else you may spare",
    "Your mistress a share,",
    "The secret will never be known:",
    "She cannot discover",
    "The breath of her lover,",
    "But think it as sweet as her own.",
    "HERRINGS",
    "Be not sparing,",
    "Leave off swearing.",
    "Buy my herring",
    "Fresh from Malahide,",
    "Better never was tried.",
    "Come, eat them with pure fresh butter and mustard,",
    "Their bellies are soft, and as white as a custard.",
    "Come, sixpence a dozen, to get me some bread,",
    "Or, like my own herrings, I soon shall be dead."

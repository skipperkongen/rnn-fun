    "A pair of Orpingtons,",
    "one blue, the other black,",
    "with iridescent necks",
    "and fine, ashen fluff",
    "cackle through the dark,",
    "their damp calls close enough",
    "to chafe, a friction with no spark.",
    "They settle down to roost,",
    "two rests along a stave.",
    "Each curls into itself,",
    "comb tucked beneath a wing,",
    "as the days grow long enough",
    "to kindle in each a yolk,",
    "the smallest flame of spring."

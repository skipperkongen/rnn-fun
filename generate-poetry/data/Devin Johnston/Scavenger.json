    "A rail, buff-banded rail,",
    "weaves among the legs",
    "of picnickers who loll at ease",
    "on the buttress roots of fig trees.",
    "It queries fallen fruit",
    "with manners so refined",
    "as to be indeterminate,",
    "its herringbone immaculate.",
    "Aloof though underfoot,",
    "the rail extracts a crust",
    "of pie from picnic residue \u2014",
    "no seediness, no trace",
    "of table-scrap solicitude",
    "for any human hand or face."

    "It\u2019s more than silhouettes tonight,",
    "every window in the city lit,",
    "shades lifted, curtains open.",
    "As one suspected, the dark buildings",
    "full of lovers, undressing",
    "beneath light bulbs, before mirrors.",
    "Men & women, men & men, women & women, embracing.",
    "Even the loners visible, flickered",
    "by single candles, touching",
    "places they\u2019ve usually chosen to keep secret.",
    "So much nakedness!",
    "And the streets empty",
    "except for the newsboys moving through shadows,",
    "leafless trees snatching underclothes",
    "out of wind, the El clattering",
    "above the roofs",
    "like a strip of blue movie."

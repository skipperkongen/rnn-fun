    "A man steps out of sunlight,",
    "sunlight that streams like grace,",
    "still gaping at blue sky",
    "staked across the emptiness of space,",
    "into a history where shadows",
    "assume a human face.",
    "A man slips into silence",
    "that began as a cry,",
    "still trailing music",
    "although reduced to the sigh",
    "of an accordion",
    "as it folds into its case."

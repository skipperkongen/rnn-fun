    "She mops a washcloth down his spine and scrubs",
    "until his bones glow with the inner light of porcelain",
    "and when his Haloed hair bursts forth into foam",
    "he holds his nose and dunks beneath the soapy gloom",
    "ears flooding with signals",
    "the pipes transmit like microphones.",
    "The boy can hear another city, the one below",
    "where wind coils when it isn\u2019t howling,",
    "one can hear Purgatory boil",
    "up through the manholes, a river flushing souls",
    "into the underworld, tomorrow\u2019s news",
    "bawled at the crossroad of subway and sewer.",
    "If he were accidentally to swallow here",
    "the water would taste like silver",
    "off a dead man\u2019s eyes. Upstairs,",
    "the mute \u00e9migr\u00e9 waitress he secretly",
    "adores sings naked in the shower,",
    "the newlyweds from Mexico",
    "rage about",
    ", next door",
    "a newborn wails like a Black Maria,",
    "while in a hidden room, a crazy old man",
    "won\u2019t stop repeating \u201cthe goddamn, the goddman!\u201d",
    "And the boy comes up for air,",
    "eyes burning, rinsed hair silky, his hands",
    "wrinkled,",
    "says, as prunes.",
    "Overhead, the bare bulb fogs with steam.",
    "She jerks the plug, the drain",
    "gulps a vortex of gray bathwater.",
    "It\u2019s time to rinse before it sucks him down,",
    "to stand calf-deep, lacquered with Ivory,",
    "smoldering before a faucet that trickles",
    "a cool stream at which",
    "washes him",
    "first gently in front and then behind",
    "in a way that no one else will ever wash him.",
    "The moon, too, must be fogged above",
    "misted lamps that bleed into reflections",
    "on the marbled pane.",
    "He swipes abstractions in the sweat,",
    "finger painting night",
    "while",
    "towels his hair",
    "as if reviving a drowned sailor",
    "the sea has graciously returned.",
    "Don\u2019t worry,",
    ", your grandson is clean",
    "for Saturday night:",
    "ears, navel, nails, inspected,",
    "teeth unstained, cleansed as baptism",
    "leaves the soul, pure enough to sleep\u2014",
    "as you instruct him\u2014with the angels,",
    "cleaner than he\u2019ll ever be again."

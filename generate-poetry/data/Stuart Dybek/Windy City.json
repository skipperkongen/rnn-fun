    "The garments worn in flying dreams",
    "were fashioned there\u2014",
    "overcoats that swooped like kites,",
    "scarves streaming like vapor trails,",
    "gowns ballooning into spinnakers.",
    "In a city like that one might sail",
    "through life led by a runaway hat.",
    "The young scattered in whatever directions",
    "their wild hair pointed, and gusting",
    "into one another, fell in love.",
    "At night, wind rippled saxophones",
    "that hung like windchimes in pawnshop",
    "windows, hooting through each horn",
    "so that the streets seemed haunted",
    "not by nighthawks, but by doves.",
    "Pinwheels whirled from steeples",
    "in place of crosses. At the pinnacles",
    "of public buildings, snagged underclothes\u2014",
    "the only flag\u2014flapped majestically.",
    "And when it came time to disappear",
    "one simply chose a thoroughfare",
    "devoid of memories, raised a collar,",
    "and turned his back on the wind.",
    "I closed my eyes and stepped",
    "into a swirl of scuttling leaves."

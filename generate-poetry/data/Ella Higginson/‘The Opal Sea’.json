    "An inland sea \u2013 blue as a sapphire \u2013 set",
    "Within a sparkling, emerald mountain chain",
    "Where day and night fir-needles sift like rain",
    "Thro\u2019 the voluptuous air. The soft winds fret",
    "The waves, and beat them wantonly to foam.",
    "The golden distances across the sea",
    "Are shot with rose and purple. Languorously",
    "The silver seabirds in wide circles roam.",
    "The sun drops slowly down the flaming West",
    "And flings its rays across to set aglow",
    "The islands rocking on the cool waves\u2019 crest",
    "And the great glistening domes of snow on snow.",
    "And thro\u2019 the mist the Olympics flash and float",
    "Like opals linked around a beating throat."

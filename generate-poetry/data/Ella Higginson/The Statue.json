    "That I might chisel a statue, line on line,",
    "Out of a marble\u2019s chaste severities!",
    "Angular, harsh; no softened curves to please;",
    "Set tears within the eyes to make them shine,",
    "And furrows on the brow, deep, stern, yet fine;",
    "Gaunt, awkward, tall; no courtier of ease;",
    "The trousers bulging at the bony knees;",
    "Long nose, large mouth . . . But ah, the light divine",
    "Of Truth, \u2013 the light that set a people free!\u2014",
    "Burning upon it in a steady flame,",
    "As sunset fires a white peak on the sky . . .",
    "Ah, God! To leave it nameless and yet see",
    "Men looking weep and bow themselves and cry\u2014",
    "\u2018Enough, enough! We know thy statue\u2019s name!\u2019"

    "The soft-toned clock upon the stair chimed three\u2014",
    "Too sweet for sleep, too early yet to rise.",
    "In restful peace I lay with half-closed eyes,",
    "Watching the tender hours go dreamily;",
    "The tide was flowing in; I heard the sea",
    "Shivering along the sands; while yet the skies",
    "Were dim, uncertain, as the light that lies",
    "Beneath the fretwork of some wild-rose tree",
    "Within the thicket gray. The chanticleer",
    "Sent drowsy calls across the slumbrous air;",
    "In solemn silence sweet it was to hear",
    "My own heart beat . . . Then broad and deep and fair\u2014",
    "Trembling in its new birth from heaven\u2019s womb\u2014",
    "One crimson shaft of dawn sank thro\u2019 my room."

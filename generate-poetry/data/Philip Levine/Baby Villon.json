    "He tells me in Bangkok he\u2019s robbed",
    "Because he\u2019s white; in London because he\u2019s black;",
    "In Barcelona, Jew; in Paris, Arab:",
    "Everywhere and at all times, and he fights back.",
    "He holds up seven thick little fingers",
    "To show me he\u2019s rated seventh in the world,",
    "And there\u2019s no passion in his voice, no anger",
    "In the flat brown eyes flecked with blood.",
    "He asks me to tell all I can remember",
    "Of my father, his uncle; he talks of the war",
    "In North Africa and what came after,",
    "The loss of his father, the loss of his brother,",
    "The windows of the bakery smashed and the fresh bread",
    "Dusted with glass, the warm smell of rye",
    "So strong he ate till his mouth filled with blood.",
    "\u201cHere they live, here they live and not die,\u201d",
    "And he points down at his black head ridged",
    "With black kinks of hair. He touches my hair,",
    "Tells me I should never disparage",
    "The stiff bristles that guard the head of the fighter.",
    "Sadly his fingers wander over my face,",
    "And he says how fair I am, how smooth.",
    "We stand to end this first and last visit.",
    "Stiff, 116 pounds, five feet two,",
    "No bigger than a girl, he holds my shoulders,",
    "Kisses my lips, his eyes still open,",
    "My imaginary brother, my cousin,",
    "Myself made otherwise by all his pain."

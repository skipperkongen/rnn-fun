    "You can tell because it\u2019s taken all",
    "The colors and left only the spaces",
    "Between colors where the absence",
    "Of rage and hunger survives. If you could",
    "Get close you could touch the embers",
    "Of red, the tiny beaks of yellow,",
    "The color of heaven. Behind the house",
    "The children digging in the flower beds",
    "Have been out there since dawn waiting",
    "To be called in for hot chocolate or tea",
    "Or the remnants of meals. No one can see",
    "Them, even though children are meant",
    "To be seen, and these are good kids",
    "Who go on working in silence.",
    "They\u2019re called the gatekeeper\u2019s children,",
    "Any gatekeeper, but if there were",
    "These would be his, the seven of them,",
    "Heads bowed, knifing the earth. Is that rain,",
    "Snow, or what smearing their vision?",
    "Remember, in the beginning they agreed",
    "To accept a sky that answered nothing,",
    "They agreed to lower their eyes, to accept",
    "The gifts the hard ground hoarded.",
    "Even though they were only children",
    "They agreed to draw no more breath",
    "Than fire requires and yet never to burn."

    "We stand in the rain in a long line",
    "waiting at Ford Highland Park. For work.",
    "You know what work is\u2014if you\u2019re",
    "old enough to read this you know what",
    "work is, although you may not do it.",
    "Forget you. This is about waiting,",
    "shifting from one foot to another.",
    "Feeling the light rain falling like mist",
    "into your hair, blurring your vision",
    "until you think you see your own brother",
    "ahead of you, maybe ten places.",
    "You rub your glasses with your fingers,",
    "and of course it\u2019s someone else\u2019s brother,",
    "narrower across the shoulders than",
    "yours but with the same sad slouch, the grin",
    "that does not hide the stubbornness,",
    "the sad refusal to give in to",
    "rain, to the hours of wasted waiting,",
    "to the knowledge that somewhere ahead",
    "a man is waiting who will say, \u201cNo,",
    "we\u2019re not hiring today,\u201d for any",
    "reason he wants. You love your brother,",
    "now suddenly you can hardly stand",
    "the love flooding you for your brother,",
    "who\u2019s not beside you or behind or",
    "ahead because he\u2019s home trying to",
    "sleep off a miserable night shift",
    "at Cadillac so he can get up",
    "before noon to study his German.",
    "Works eight hours a night so he can sing",
    "Wagner, the opera you hate most,",
    "the worst music ever invented.",
    "How long has it been since you told him",
    "you loved him, held his wide shoulders,",
    "opened your eyes wide and said those words,",
    "and maybe kissed his cheek? You\u2019ve never",
    "done something so simple, so obvious,",
    "not because you\u2019re too young or too dumb,",
    "not because you\u2019re jealous or even mean",
    "or incapable of crying in",
    "the presence of another man, no,",
    "just because you don\u2019t know what work is."

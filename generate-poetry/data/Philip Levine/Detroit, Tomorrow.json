    "Newspaper says the boy killed by someone,",
    "don\u2019t say who. I know the mother, waking,",
    "gets up as usual, washes her face",
    "in cold water, and starts the coffee pot.",
    "She stands by the window up there on floor",
    "sixteen wondering why the street\u2019s so calm",
    "with no cars going or coming, and then",
    "she looks at the wall clock and sees the time.",
    "Now she\u2019s too awake to go back to bed,",
    "she\u2019s too awake not to remember him,",
    "her one son, or to forget exactly",
    "how long yesterday was, each moment dragged",
    "into the next by the force of her will",
    "until she thought this simply cannot be.",
    "She sits at the scarred, white kitchen table,",
    "the two black windows staring back at her,",
    "wondering how she\u2019ll go back to work today.",
    "The windows don\u2019t see anything: they\u2019re black,",
    "eyeless, they give back only what\u2019s given;",
    "sometimes, like now, even less than what\u2019s given,",
    "yet she stares into their two black faces",
    "moving her head from side to side, like this,",
    "just like I\u2019m doing now. Try it awhile,",
    "go ahead, it\u2019s not going to kill you.",
    "Now say something, it doesn\u2019t matter what",
    "you say because all the words are useless:",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d \u201cThis too will pass.\u201d",
    "\u201cHe was who he was.\u201d She won\u2019t hear you out",
    "because she can only hear the torn words",
    "she uses to pray to die. This afternoon",
    "you and I will see her just before four",
    "alight nimbly from the bus, her lunch box",
    "of one sandwich, a thermos of coffee,",
    "a navel orange secured under her arm,",
    "and we\u2019ll look away. Under your breath make",
    "her one promise and keep it forever:",
    "in the little store-front church down the block,",
    "the one with the front windows newspapered,",
    "you won\u2019t come on Saturday or Sunday",
    "to kneel down and pray for life eternal."

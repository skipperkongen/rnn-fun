    "The little girl won\u2019t eat her sandwich;",
    "she lifts the bun and looks in, but the grey beef",
    "coated with relish is always there.",
    "Her mother says, \u201cDo it for mother.\u201d",
    "Milk and relish and a hard bun that comes off",
    "like a hat\u2014a kid\u2019s life is a cinch.",
    "And a mother\u2019s life? \u201cWhat can you do",
    "with a man like that?\u201d she asks the sleeping cook",
    "and then the old Negro who won\u2019t sit.",
    "\u201cHe\u2019s been out all night trying to get it.",
    "I hope he gets it. What did he ever do",
    "but get it?\u201d The Negro doesn\u2019t look,",
    "though he looks like he\u2019s been out all night",
    "trying. Everyone\u2019s been out all night trying.",
    "Why else would we be drinking beer",
    "at attention? If she were younger,",
    "or if I were Prince Valiant, I would say that fate",
    "brought me here to quiet the crying,",
    "to sweeten the sandwich of the child,",
    "to waken the cook, to stop the Negro from",
    "bearing witness to the world. The dawn",
    "still hasn\u2019t come, and now we hear",
    "the 8 o\u2019clock whistles blasting from heaven,",
    "and with no morning the day is sold."

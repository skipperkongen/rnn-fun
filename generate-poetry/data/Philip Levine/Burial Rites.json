    "Everyone comes back here to die",
    "as I will soon. The place feels right",
    "since it\u2019s half dead to begin with.",
    "Even on a rare morning of rain,",
    "like this morning, with the low sky",
    "hoarding its riches except for",
    "a few mock tears, the hard ground",
    "accepts nothing. Six years ago",
    "I buried my mother\u2019s ashes",
    "beside a young lilac that\u2019s now",
    "taller than I, and stuck the stub",
    "of a rosebush into her dirt,",
    "where like everything else not",
    "human it thrives. The small blossoms",
    "never unfurl; whatever they know",
    "they keep to themselves until",
    "a morning rain or a night wind",
    "pares the petals down to nothing.",
    "Even the neighbor cat who shits",
    "daily on the paths and then hides",
    "deep in the jungle of the weeds",
    "refuses to purr. Whatever\u2019s here",
    "is just here, and nowhere else,",
    "so it\u2019s right to end up beside",
    "the woman who bore me, to shovel",
    "into the dirt whatever\u2019s left",
    "and leave only a name for some-",
    "one who wants it. Think of it,",
    "my name, no longer a portion",
    "of me, no longer inflated",
    "or bruised, no longer stewing",
    "in a rich compost of memory",
    "or the simpler one of bone shards,",
    "dirt, kitty litter, wood ashes,",
    "the roots of the eucalyptus",
    "I planted in \u201973,",
    "a tiny me taking nothing,",
    "giving nothing, and free at last."

    "When my brother came home from war",
    "he carried his left arm in a black sling",
    "but assured us most of it was still there.",
    "Spring was late, the trees forgot to leaf out.",
    "I stood in a long line waiting for bread.",
    "The woman behind me said it was shameless,",
    "someone as strong as I still home, still intact",
    "while her Michael was burning to death.",
    "Yes, she could feel the fire, could smell",
    "his pain all the way from Tarawa\u2013",
    "or was it Midway?\u2013and he so young,",
    "younger than I, who was only fourteen,",
    "taller, more handsome in his white uniform",
    "turning slowly gray the way unprimed wood",
    "grays slowly in the grate when the flames",
    "sputter and die. \u201cI think I\u2019m going mad,\u201d",
    "she said when I turned to face her. She placed",
    "both hands on my shoulders, kissed each eyelid,",
    "hugged me to her breasts and whispered wetly",
    "in my bad ear words I\u2019d never heard before.",
    "When I got home my brother ate the bread",
    "carefully one slice at a time until",
    "nothing was left but a blank plate. \u201cDid you see her,\u201d",
    "he asked, \u201cthe woman in hell, Michael\u2019s wife?\u201d",
    "That afternoon I walked the crowded streets",
    "looking for something I couldn\u2019t name,",
    "something familiar, a face or a voice or less,",
    "but not these shards of ash that fell from heaven."

    "Out of burlap sacks, out of bearing butter,",
    "Out of black bean and wet slate bread,",
    "Out of the acids of rage, the candor of tar,",
    "Out of creosote, gasoline, drive shafts, wooden dollies,",
    "They Lion grow.",
    "Out of the gray hills",
    "Of industrial barns, out of rain, out of bus ride,",
    "West Virginia to Kiss My Ass, out of buried aunties,",
    "Mothers hardening like pounded stumps, out of stumps,",
    "Out of the bones\u2019 need to sharpen and the muscles\u2019 to stretch,",
    "They Lion grow.",
    "Earth is eating trees, fence posts,",
    "Gutted cars, earth is calling in her little ones,",
    "\u201cCome home, Come home!\u201d From pig balls,",
    "From the ferocity of pig driven to holiness,",
    "From the furred ear and the full jowl come",
    "The repose of the hung belly, from the purpose",
    "They Lion grow.",
    "From the sweet glues of the trotters",
    "Come the sweet kinks of the fist, from the full flower",
    "Of the hams the thorax of caves,",
    "From \u201cBow Down\u201d come \u201cRise Up,\u201d",
    "Come they Lion from the reeds of shovels,",
    "The grained arm that pulls the hands,",
    "They Lion grow.",
    "From my five arms and all my hands,",
    "From all my white sins forgiven, they feed,",
    "From my car passing under the stars,",
    "They Lion, from my children inherit,",
    "From the oak turned to a wall, they Lion,",
    "From they sack and they belly opened",
    "And all that was hidden burning on the oil-stained earth",
    "They feed they Lion and he comes."

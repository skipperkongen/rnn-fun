    "We stripped in the first warm spring night",
    "and ran down into the Detroit River",
    "to baptize ourselves in the brine",
    "of car parts, dead fish, stolen bicycles,",
    "melted snow. I remember going under",
    "hand in hand with a Polish highschool girl",
    "I'd never seen before, and the cries",
    "our breath made caught at the same time",
    "on the cold, and rising through the layers",
    "of darkness into the final moonless atmosphere",
    "that was this world, the girl breaking",
    "the surface after me and swimming out",
    "on the starless waters towards the lights",
    "of Jefferson Ave. and the stacks",
    "of the old stove factory unwinking.",
    "Turning at last to see no island at all",
    "but a perfect calm dark as far",
    "as there was sight, and then a light",
    "and another riding low out ahead",
    "to bring us home, ore boats maybe, or smokers",
    "walking alone. Back panting",
    "to the gray coarse beach we didn't dare",
    "fall on, the damp piles of clothes,",
    "and dressing side by side in silence",
    "to go back where we came from."

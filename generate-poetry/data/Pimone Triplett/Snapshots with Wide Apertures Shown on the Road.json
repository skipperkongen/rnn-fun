    "This one\u2019s on Route 80 south of Water\u2019s End, Arizona, speeding",
    "anywhere else when I\u2019m tired",
    "of reading the yellow dash-and-dash, highway\u2019s old adage.",
    "Sunglasses coaxed",
    "yellows to reds, though there are none where I look",
    "into the camera.",
    "Behind me, a blur of roadside cactus called",
    "\u201csucculents,\u201d",
    "for the moisture they save for years.",
    "The sky cut from indigo to blue to white until",
    "I wished for the sunset\u2019s truncations to stay there,",
    "thinking, too, that the verge of its curve",
    "could flirt me into",
    "the absolute.",
    "2",
    "Moving on, in Bangkok, I\u2019m always crouching in these,",
    "wanting to keep my head",
    "lower than his",
    "to show I know",
    "he\u2019s Mother\u2019s father.",
    "Asked, on going in, not to say anything",
    "if he brought up the distant",
    "old dealings, metallic shrillings",
    "of long-dead women,",
    "asked to ignore what they\u2019d do for him,",
    "offerings he could almost eat a meal on.",
    "And this from the aunt who was asked to leave",
    "the family when she was young,",
    "\u201cfor the sake of the children,\u201d",
    "drawing the bad lot.",
    "No one told me why.",
    "That\u2019s my foot in the foreground.",
    "That was the daylight\u2019s assignment",
    "of unwavering white, the background.",
    "These are only the circumstances. As for an end to the glare",
    "getting the last word in,",
    "there was none.",
    "3",
    "He\u2019d set the machine on the tripod himself,",
    "return to read the newspaper, wait for the click,",
    "and want to keep it,",
    "the stop-time, that is,",
    "the pretending to read the newspaper.",
    "Held half in the shadow fans of the palm tree,",
    "half in a browbeat of sun.",
    "So that the machine had to catch him quickly, the clarity,",
    "the shot of his legs as",
    "suddenly: brown leather sheaves holding bone.",
    "4",
    "Say the moment arrives",
    "at the frame, and she who is about to enter",
    "the picture approaches.",
    "At the end of the road trip, she turns back",
    "in the hopes of memorizing what\u2019s been passed,",
    "the colors that changed, the mirror-winks,",
    "the real moisture, invisible, along side mirage.",
    "His face was a once-darker shade of dust in his country.",
    "Some days he\u2019d set the aperture, the opening,",
    "as wide as he could,",
    "to ruin the picture, to let all the light in."

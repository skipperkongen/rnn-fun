    "I can tell you, sweeping the several jigsaw lizards",
    "away from your casket, away from their expert",
    "invasions, kneeling by the order of our births",
    "alongside the mother-of-pearl mosaics,",
    "the family at your death keeps to form,",
    "having to act out that love of endings.",
    "I can say the little I know of how you lived",
    "is your patient gaze in old photographs,",
    "surrounded by three generations, most of the spindling",
    "offspring back from the States or Australia or wherever",
    "they\u2019d been taken, children barely known but abided",
    "on holidays. Today I\u2019m told we have to place",
    "pennies in the dead man\u2019s mouth",
    "to remind us of the portions",
    "left behind.",
    "someone says,",
    "up against the father tongue. It\u2019s the formal",
    "silence we love, the hush that\u2019s planned,",
    "the good answer,",
    "monks, boyish and newly shorn, who know",
    "to whip your burial cloth exactly three times",
    "over the altar flame to purify countless threads.",
    "Who know when to kneel, when to back away",
    "from the casket. The casket itself carved",
    "patiently, inlaid with the images,",
    "portions left behind of silver",
    "shrunken disciples, each framed to each then",
    "framed again by",
    "squares of alabaster scrollwork",
    "whittled into black wood:",
    "the whole teak surface worried,",
    "Grandfather, with carpenter\u2019s gold,",
    "splintered,",
    "then resplintered, puzzled with lapis.",
    "The eastern window\u2019s been slivered open,",
    "to make the sun stab",
    "the craftmen\u2019s metallic fretwork.",
    "The mourners too,",
    "suddenly embossed, become dozens shifting",
    "to kneel. When a few clouds",
    "eclipse the sun, wiping away the borders,",
    "the frame and scrimshaw,",
    "so that we stand",
    "briefly",
    "in the room\u2019s darkened largeness,",
    "next to me someone whispers,",
    "how your vessel is rented,",
    "a work",
    "to be given back."

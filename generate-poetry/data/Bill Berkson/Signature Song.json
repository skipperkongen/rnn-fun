    "Bunny Berigan first recorded \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Started\u201d",
    "with a small group that included Joe Bushkin, Cozy Cole",
    "and Artie Shaw in 1936.",
    "Earlier that same year, the song,",
    "written by Ira Gershwin and Vernon Duke,",
    "and rendered as a duet patter number by Bob Hope and Eve",
    "Arden, made its debut on Broadway in",
    ".",
    "By 1937, when Berigan re-recorded it in a big-band setting,",
    "\u201cI Can\u2019t\u201d had become his signature song,",
    "even though, within a few months, Billie Holiday would record",
    "her astonishing version backed",
    "by Lester Young and the rest of the Basie Orchestra.",
    "Lovers for a time, Lee Wiley and Berigan began appearing",
    "together on Wiley\u2019s fifteen-minute CBS radio spot,",
    "in 1936.",
    "Berigan died from alcoholism-related causes on June 2, 1942.",
    "Although \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Started\u201d is perfectly suited to Wiley\u2019s",
    "deep phrasing and succinct vibrato, she recorded the ballad only",
    "once, informally, in 1945, during a Town Hall performance date.",
    "The Spanish Civil War started in 1936 and ended in 1939",
    "with Generalissimo Francisco Franco\u2019s forces entering Madrid.",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve settled revolutions in Spain\u201d goes Gershwin\u2019s lyric, just as odd."

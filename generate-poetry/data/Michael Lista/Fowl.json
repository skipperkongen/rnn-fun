    "The girl from Scarborough liked being slapped",
    "Down the hall from where her mother slept.",
    "A big, hard-working hand, anybody\u2019s",
    "To come medicinally down, antibody",
    "To the slow infection of her Western face",
    "(what sucked the most was that it wasn\u2019t fast).",
    "Some birds don\u2019t migrate. Above, two lonely fowl",
    "Scream across the sky their only vowel.",
    "This river I step in is not the river",
    "I stand in. We\u2019ll drive to Leslieville, wherever,",
    "Park in the Guildwood GO lot and get stoned.",
    "Who\u2019s there? Nay, answer me. Stand",
    "And unfold yourself. Her heart begins to pound.",
    "No geese go winging to the rooky pond",
    "No goslings disappear their small and speckled.",
    "If we endure this, it will make us special."

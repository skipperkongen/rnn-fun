    "Bury your heart in some deep green hollow",
    "Or hide it up in a kind old tree;",
    "Better still, give it the swallow",
    "When she goes over the sea.",
    "In Saturday\u2019s Market there\u2019s eggs a \u2019plenty",
    "And dead-alive ducks with their legs tied down,",
    "Grey old gaffers and boys of twenty\u2014",
    "Girls and the women of the town\u2014",
    "Pitchers and sugar-sticks, ribbons and laces,",
    "Poises and whips and dicky-birds\u2019 seed,",
    "Silver pieces and smiling faces,",
    "In Saturday Market they\u2019ve all they need.",
    "What were you showing in Saturday Market",
    "That set it grinning from end to end",
    "Girls and gaffers and boys of twenty\u2014?",
    "Cover it close with your shawl, my friend\u2014",
    "Hasten you home with the laugh behind you,",
    "Over the down\u2014, out of sight,",
    "Fasten your door, though no one will find you,",
    "No one will look on a Market night.",
    "See, you, the shawl is wet, take out from under",
    "The red dead thing\u2014. In the white of the moon",
    "On the flags does it stir again? Well, and no wonder!",
    "Best make an end of it; bury it soon.",
    "If there is blood on the hearth who\u2019ll know it?",
    "Or blood on the stairs,",
    "When a murder is over and done why show it?",
    "In Saturday Market nobody cares.",
    "Then lie you straight on your bed for a short, short weeping",
    "And still, for a long, long rest,",
    "There\u2019s never a one in the town so sure of sleeping",
    "As you, in the house on the down with a hole in your breast.",
    "Think no more of the swallow,",
    "Forget, you, the sea,",
    "Never again remember the deep green hollow",
    "Or the top of the kind old tree!"

    "I remember rooms that have had their part",
    "In the steady slowing down of the heart.",
    "The room in Paris, the room at Geneva,",
    "The little damp room with the seaweed smell,",
    "And that ceaseless maddening sound of the tide\u2014",
    "Rooms where for good or for ill\u2014things died.",
    "But there is the room where we (two) lie dead,",
    "Though every morning we seem to wake and might just as well seem to sleep again",
    "As we shall somewhere in the other quieter, dustier bed",
    "Out there in the sun\u2014in the rain."

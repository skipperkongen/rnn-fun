    "Not for that city of the level sun,",
    "Its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze\u2014",
    "The shadeless, sleepless city of white days,",
    "White nights, or nights and days that are as one\u2014",
    "We weary, when all is said , all thought, all done.",
    "We strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see",
    "What, from the threshold of eternity",
    "We shall step into. No, I think we shun",
    "The splendour of that everlasting glare,",
    "The clamour of that never-ending song.",
    "And if for anything we greatly long,",
    "It is for some remote and quiet stair",
    "Which winds to silence and a space for sleep",
    "Too sound for waking and for dreams too deep."

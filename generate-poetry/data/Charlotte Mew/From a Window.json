    "Up here, with June, the sycamore throws",
    "Across the window a whispering screen;",
    "I shall miss the sycamore more, I suppose,",
    "Than anything else on this earth that is out in green.",
    "But I mean to go through the door without fear,",
    "Not caring much what happens here",
    "When I\u2019m away:\u2014",
    "How green the screen is across the panes",
    "Or who goes laughing along the lanes",
    "With my old lover all summer day."

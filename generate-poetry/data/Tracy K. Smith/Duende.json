    "1.",
    "The earth is dry and they live wanting.",
    "Each with a small reservoir",
    "Of furious music heavy in the throat.",
    "They drag it out and with nails in their feet",
    "Coax the night into being. Brief believing.",
    "A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies.",
    "And in this night that is not night,",
    "Each word is a wish, each phrase",
    "A shape their bodies ache to fill\u2014",
    "They defy gravity to feel tugged back.",
    "The clatter, the mad slap of landing.",
    "2.",
    "And not just them. Not just",
    "The ramshackle family, the",
    "not just the",
    "Whose heels have notched",
    "And hammered time",
    "So the hours flow in place",
    "Like a tin river, marking",
    "Only what once was.",
    "Not just the voices of scraping",
    "Against the river, nor the hands",
    "Nudging them farther, fingers",
    "Like blind birds, palms empty,",
    "Echoing. Not just the women",
    "With sober faces and flowers",
    "In their hair, the ones who dance",
    "As though they\u2019re burying",
    "Memory\u2014one last time\u2014",
    "Beneath them.",
    "And I hate to do it here.",
    "To set myself heavily beside them.",
    "Not now that they\u2019ve proven",
    "The body a myth, a parable",
    "For what not even language",
    "Moves quickly enough to name.",
    "If I call it pain, and try to touch it",
    "With my hands, my own life,",
    "It lies still and the music thins,",
    "A pulse felt for through garments.",
    "If I lean into the desire it starts from\u2014",
    "If I lean unbuttoned into the blow",
    "Of loss after loss, love tossed",
    "Into the ecstatic void\u2014",
    "It carries me with it farther,",
    "To chords that stretch and bend",
    "Like light through colored glass.",
    "But it races on, toward shadows",
    "Where the world I know",
    "And the world I fear",
    "Threaten to meet.",
    "3.",
    "There is always a road,",
    "The sea, dark hair,",
    "Always a question",
    "Bigger than itself\u2014"

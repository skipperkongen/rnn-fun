    "The first track still almost swings. High hat and snare, even",
    "A few bars of sax the stratosphere will singe-out soon enough.",
    "Synthesized strings. Then something like cellophane",
    "Breaking in as if snagged to a shoe. Crinkle and drag. White noise,",
    "Black noise. What must be voices bob up, then drop, like metal shavings",
    "In molasses. So much for us. So much for the flags we bored",
    "Into planets dry as chalk, for the tin cans we filled with fire",
    "And rode like cowboys into all we tried to tame. Listen:",
    "The dark we've only ever imagined now audible, thrumming,",
    "Marbled with static like gristly meat. A chorus of engines churns.",
    "Silence taunts: a dare. Everything that disappears",
    "Disappears as if returning somewhere."

    "She wants a house full of cups and the ghosts",
    "of last century\u2019s lesbians; I want a spotless",
    "apartment, a fast computer. She wants a woodstove,",
    "three cords of ash, an axe; I want",
    "a clean gas flame. She wants a row of jars:",
    "oats, coriander, thick green oil;",
    "I want nothing to store. She wants pomanders,",
    "linens, baby quilts, scrapbooks. She wants Wellesley",
    "reunions. I want gleaming floorboards, the river\u2019s",
    "reflection. She wants shrimp and sweat and salt;",
    "she wants chocolate. I want a raku bowl,",
    "steam rising from rice. She wants goats,",
    "chickens, children. Feeding and weeping. I want",
    "wind from the river freshening cleared rooms.",
    "She wants birthdays, theaters, flags, peonies.",
    "I want words like lasers. She wants a mother\u2019s",
    "tenderness. Touch ancient as the river.",
    "I want a woman\u2019s wit swift as a fox.",
    "She\u2019s in her city, meeting",
    "her deadline; I\u2019m in my mill village out late",
    "with the dog, listening to the pinging wind bells, thinking",
    "of the twelve years of wanting, apart and together.",
    "We\u2019ve kissed all weekend; we want",
    "to drive the hundred miles and try it again."

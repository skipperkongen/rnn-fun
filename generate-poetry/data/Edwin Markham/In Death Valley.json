    "There came gray stretches of volcanic plains,",
    "Bare, lone and treeless, then a bleak lone hill",
    "Like to the dolorous hill that Dobell saw.",
    "Around were heaps of ruins piled between",
    "The Burn o\u2019 Sorrow and the Water o\u2019 Care;",
    "And from the stillness of the down-crushed walls",
    "One pillar rose up dark against the moon.",
    "There was a nameless Presence everywhere;",
    "In the gray soil there was a purple stain,",
    "And the gray reticent rocks were dyed with blood\u2014",
    "Blood of a vast unknown Calamity.",
    "It was the mark of some ancestral grief\u2014",
    "Grief that began before the ancient Flood."

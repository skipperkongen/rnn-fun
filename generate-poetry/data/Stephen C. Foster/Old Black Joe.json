    "Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay,",
    "Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away,",
    "Gone from the earth to a better land I know,",
    "I hear their gentle voices calling \u201cOld Black Joe.\u201d",
    "I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming, for my head is bending low:",
    "I hear those gentle voices calling, \u201cOld Black Joe.\u201d",
    "Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain",
    "Why do I sigh that my friends come not again,",
    "Grieving for forms Now departed long a go?",
    "I hear their gentle voices calling \u201cOld Black Joe.\u201d",
    "I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming, for my head is bending low:",
    "I hear those gentle voices calling, \u201cOld Black Joe.\u201d",
    "Where are the hearts once so happy and so free?",
    "The children so dear that I held upon my knee,",
    "Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go.",
    "I hear their gentle voices calling \u201cOld Black Joe.\u201d",

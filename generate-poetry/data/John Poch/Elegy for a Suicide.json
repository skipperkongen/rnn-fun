    "She always liked to blow the candles out. Fact:",
    "there\u2019s only so much you can do with friction",
    "and an intentional hand before the hand burns.",
    "The sound that scissors make in a child\u2019s hand",
    "while crunching construction paper aches when",
    "she grows older. Even popcorn ceilings lose that style,",
    "that feeling of a cereal freshly drowned in milk.",
    "Ah, the white beneath things. And the black below that.",
    "We come down from bunk beds. We come down from",
    "the funky reds and yellows of the spring\u2019s summer tanager",
    "gone in fall. We fail to see the most vivid birds",
    "high in the trees on the other side of leaves.",
    "Where did those sad seeds come from or how take root?",
    "Her departure spun out of some samara down into a maple",
    "shadow that shadows well into night\u2019s sweet syrup.",
    "O host, we don\u2019t know the words for this country,",
    "and this country pretends we have no knife,",
    "no guns in the bedroom, no large car for escaping",
    "or crashing over hard hillsides or into houses.",
    "We stuff our faces, blank as pills, with pills.",
    "No one wants to open that book, but it\u2019s a book."

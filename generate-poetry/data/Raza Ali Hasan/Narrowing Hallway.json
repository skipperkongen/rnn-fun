    "The unkempt beard of the fearsome mullah",

    "They stand tiptoe, toe deep in the master culture,",
    "arguing in an emptying, narrowing hallway,",
    "in the high imperial language of their poetry,",
    "over what became of the muffled, cuffed bulbul",
    "or of the straw-stuffed, stone-eyed mynah,",
    "over the proper ornithology for the symbols of woe."

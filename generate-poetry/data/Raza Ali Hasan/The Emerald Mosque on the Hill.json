    "In the lull, the afternoon sun warms",
    "the linseed field. The flowers are quiet,",
    "their bright subdued in the green",
    "while the mind wanders",
    "to the emerald mosque upon the hill,",
    "built around a flowing spring,",
    "the easy absolutions and ablutions",
    "in that mosque where the spring water",
    "has been let loose to meander",
    "over marble courtyards and inner chambers,",
    "across the geometric, green-tiled floor that",
    "cools the heels of the faithful."

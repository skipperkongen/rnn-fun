    "I lift\u2014lift you five States away your glass,",
    "Wide of this bar you never graced, where none",
    "Ever I know came, where what work is done",
    "Even by these men I know not, where a brass",
    "Police-car sign peers in, wet strange cars pass,",
    "Soiled hangs the rag of day out over this town,",
    "A juke-box brains air where I drink alone,",
    "The spruce barkeep sports a toupee alas\u2014",
    "My glass I lift at six o'clock, my darling,",
    "As you plotted . . Chinese couples shift in bed,",
    "We shared today not even filthy weather,",
    "Beasts in the hills their tigerish love are snarling,",
    "Suddenly they clash, I blow my short ash red,",
    "Grey eyes light! and we have our drink together."

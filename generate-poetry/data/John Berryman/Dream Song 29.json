    "There sat down, once, a thing on Henry\u2019s heart",
    "s\u00f3 heavy, if he had a hundred years",
    "& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time",
    "Henry could not make good.",
    "Starts again always in Henry\u2019s ears",
    "the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.",
    "And there is another thing he has in mind",
    "like a grave Sienese face a thousand years",
    "would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of. Ghastly,",
    "with open eyes, he attends, blind.",
    "All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;",
    "thinking.",
    "But never did Henry, as he thought he did,",
    "end anyone and hacks her body up",
    "and hide the pieces, where they may be found.",
    "He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody\u2019s missing.",
    "Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.",
    "Nobody is ever missing."

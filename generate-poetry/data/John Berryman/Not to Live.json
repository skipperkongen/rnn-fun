    "It kissed us, soft, to cut our throats, this coast,",
    "like a malice of the lazy King. I hunt,",
    "& hunt! but find here what to kill?\u2014nothing is blunt,",
    "but phantoming uneases I find. Ghost",
    "on ghost precedes of all most scared us, most",
    "we fled. Howls fail upon this secret, far air: grunt,",
    "shaming for food; you must. I love the King",
    "& it was not I who strangled at the toast",
    "but a flux of a free & dying adjutant:",
    "God be with him. He & God be with us all,",
    "for we are not to live, I cannot wring,",
    "like laundry, blue my soul\u2014indecisive thing . .",
    "From undergrowth & over odd birds call",
    "and who would starv'd so survive? God save the King."

    "I put those things there.\u2014See them burn.",
    "The emerald the azure and the gold",
    "Hiss and crack, the blues & greens of the world",
    "As if I were tired. Someone interferes",
    "Everywhere with me. The clouds, the clouds are torn",
    "In ways I do not understand or love.",
    "Licking my long lips, I looked upon God",
    "And he flamed and he was friendlier",
    "Than you were, and he was small. Showing me",
    "Serpents and thin flowers; these were cold.",
    "Dominion waved & glittered like the flare",
    "From ice under a small sun. I wonder.",
    "Afterward the violent and formal dancers",
    "Came out, shaking their pithless heads.",
    "I would instruct them but I cannot now,\u2014",
    "Because of the elements. They rise and move,",
    "I nod a dance and they dance in the rain",
    "In my red coat. I am the king of the dead."

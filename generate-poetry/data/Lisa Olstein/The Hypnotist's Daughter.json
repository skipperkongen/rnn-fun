    "At the London Zoo a toddler falls over the rail",
    "of the Primate World",
    "and a female gorilla comes to sit by, to circle",
    "her long dark arm around him",
    "while the others stay away. The zookeeper says",
    "she lost a baby earlier this year",
    "and they\u2019ve been waiting months for her tits to dry.",
    "The boy\u2019s mother watches from above",
    "the thirty minutes it takes",
    "the right person to lower the right ladder down",
    "In the interim a newscaster",
    "whose station carries it live",
    "not to let go reports that dolphins and sometimes",
    "certain whales rescue people stranded at sea",
    "lift them to the air",
    "when they need breathing or swim them close enough",
    "to land. In the interim I imagine the span of time",
    "from when the smooth hard snout finds me",
    "and begins to push",
    "to when we come into view of a shore",
    "any shore. In the interim I pray for what should come",
    "to come. I pray for the cat to come out from under",
    "the floorboards",
    "to come",
    "down from the tall maple, to come back alive",
    "in one piece, still in her collar.",
    "I pray to be saved, to be sent far away, to be",
    "allowed to just stay home",
    "just stay home and erase the objects in each room",
    "with my mind while holding them in my hands",
    "I do want to hold them",
    "in my hands, to hold them to my lungs by way",
    "of deep breath",
    "and a deeper sense",
    "of inhalation. I pray for you",
    "to press out from the small veins at the back of my eyes",
    "back out into the world. I pray for you",
    "to come and sit by me"

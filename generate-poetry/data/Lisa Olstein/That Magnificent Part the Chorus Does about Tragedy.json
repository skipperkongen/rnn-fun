    "releasing excess elements from the brain. There is a theory of",
    "dreaming that each one serves to mend something torn, like",
    "cells of new skin lining up to cover a hole. I\u2019m not one to have",

    "opened the door to the rusty orange wagon and weighed those",
    "heavy duffel bags and smiles at the airport official. I boarded",
    "a tiny propeller plane and from a tiny window I watched you walk",
    "back to the rusty orange station wagon. They say the whole world",
    "is warming by imperceptible degrees. I watched the rusty orange",
    "wagon go whizzing by."

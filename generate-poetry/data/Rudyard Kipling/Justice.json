    "Before we loose the word",
    "That bids new worlds to birth,",
    "Needs must we loosen first the sword",

    "Since life on earth began,",

    "Hopeless of God and Man.",
    "A People and their King",
    "Through ancient sin grown strong,",
    "Because they feared no reckoning",
    "Would set no bound to wrong;",
    "But now their hour is past,",
    "And we who bore it find",
    "Evil Incarnate held at last",
    "To answer to mankind.",
    "For agony and spoil",
    "Of nations beat to dust,",
    "For poisoned air and tortured soil",
    "And cold, commanded lust,",
    "And every secret woe",
    "The shuddering waters saw\u2014",
    "Willed and fulfilled by high and low\u2014",
    "Let them relearn the Law:",
    "That when the dooms are read,",
    "Not high nor low shall say:\u2014",
    "\"My haughty or my humble head",
    "Has saved me in this day.\"",
    "That, till the end of time,",
    "Their remnant shall recall",
    "Their fathers' old, confederate crime",
    "Availed them not at all:",
    "That neither schools nor priests,",
    "Nor Kings may build again",
    "A people with the heart of beasts",
    "Made wise concerning men.",
    "Whereby our dead shall sleep",
    "In honour, unbetrayed,",
    "And we in faith and honour keep",
    "That peace for which they paid."

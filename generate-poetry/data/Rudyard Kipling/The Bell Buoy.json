    "They christened my brother of old\u2014",
    "And a saintly name he bears\u2014",
    "They gave him his place to hold",
    "At the head of the belfry-stairs,",
    "Where the minster-towers stand",
    "And the breeding kestrels cry.",
    "Would I change with my brother a league inland?",
    "Not I !",
    "In the flush of the hot June prime,",
    "O\u2019er sleek flood-tides afire,",
    "I hear him hurry the chime",
    "To the bidding of checked Desire;",
    "Till the sweated ringers tire",
    "And the wild bob-majors die.",
    "Could I wait for my turn in the godly choir?",
    "Not I!",
    "When the smoking scud is blown\u2014",
    "When the greasy wind-rack lowers\u2014",
    "Apart and at peace and alone,",
    "He counts the changeless hours.",
    "He wars with darkling Powers",
    "(I war with, a darkling sea);",
    "Would he stoop to my work in the gusty mirk?",
    "Not he!",
    "There was never a priest to pray,",
    "There was never a hand to toll,",
    "When they made me guard of the bay,",
    "And moored me over the shoal.",
    "I rock, I reel, and I roll\u2014",
    "My four great hammers ply\u2014",
    "Could I speak or be still at the Church\u2019s will?",
    "Not I!",
    "The landward marks have failed,",
    "The fog-bank glides unguessed,",
    "The seaward lights are veiled,",
    "The spent deep feigns her rest:",
    "But my ear is laid to her breast,",
    "I lift to the swell\u2014I cry!",
    "Could I wait in sloth on the Church\u2019s oath?",
    "Not I!",
    "At the careless end of night",
    "I thrill to the nearing screw;",
    "I turn in the clearing light",
    "And I call to the drowsy crew;",
    "And the mud boils foul and blue",
    "As the blind bow backs away.",
    "Will they give me their thanks if they clear the banks?",
    "Not they!",
    "The beach-pools cake and skim,",
    "The bursting spray-heads freeze,",
    "I gather on crown and rim",
    "The grey, grained ice of the seas,",
    "Where, sheathed from bitt to trees,",
    "The plunging colliers lie.",
    "Would I barter my place for the Church\u2019s grace?",
    "Not I!",
    "Through the blur of the whirling snow,",
    "Or the black of the inky sleet,",
    "The lanterns gather and grow,",
    "And I look for the homeward fleet.",
    "Rattle of block and sheet\u2014",
    "\u2018Ready about\u2014stand by!\u2019",
    "Shall I ask them a fee ere they fetch the quay?",
    "Not I!",
    "I dip and I surge and I swing",
    "In the rip of the racing tide,",
    "By the gates of doom I sing,",
    "On the horns of death I ride.",
    "A ship-length overside,",
    "Between the course and the sand,",
    "Fretted and bound I bide",
    "Peril whereof I cry.",
    "Would I change with my brother a league inland?",
    "Not I!"

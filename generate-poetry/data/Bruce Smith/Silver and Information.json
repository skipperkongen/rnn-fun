    "An obituary has more news than this day,",
    "brilliant, acid yellow and silver",
    "off the water at land\u2019s end. The disparate",
    "prismatic things blind you as they fin",
    "their way across the surface of the water.",
    "This light cannot inform you of your dying.",
    "Fish of lustrous nothing, fish of desire,",
    "fish whose push and syllable",
    "can make things happen,",
    "fish whose ecstatic hunger",
    "is no longer news, and fish whose mouth",
    "zeroes the multitudes, the hosts",
    "who wait for their analogies",
    "and something nice to eat, the billions",
    "the waves commemorate in their breaking",
    "down to their knees on the shore,",
    "their cloacal sound. Now",
    "how can I stay singular?",
    "How can even ore part die",
    "when I split and split",
    "like the smallest animal",
    "in the ocean until I\u2019m famous",
    "in my dismemberment, splendid",
    "in my hunger, and anonymous\u0097",
    "so that naming one",
    "is like naming one runnel",
    "the sea, or one drop of blood",
    "the intoxicating passion?",
    "I keep the multitudes in mind",
    "when I hear daily that one",
    "has murdered another. A news",
    "more silver than given,",
    "more light than anything",
    "captured. And I hold them all",
    "in mind\u0097the fulgence, the data,",
    "and the death, or else I lose it,",
    "that package of slippery fish,",
    "that don\u2019t die exactly but smell",
    "in a heaven so low we can hear",
    "the moans and feel the circles",
    "and bite in each cell."

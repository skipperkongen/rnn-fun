    "Miss Bliss, once I thought I was endless",
    "since father was perpetual in his grade school",
    "of seedlings in cups, the overly loved pets, and recess",
    "while mother was the lipsticked dancing girl",
    "on the Steel Pier who would outstep Hitler.",
    "I was insufferable when I rolled",
    "the Volkswagen bus two times and lived",
    "with the snow chains like costumed jewels",
    "slung over me and the spare rolled",
    "away as in a folktale.",
    "The pact I made in the spinning instant",
    "said in my language of American",
    "boy,",
    "to God,",
    "the State Trooper who was kind",
    "and spoke of service and punishment",
    "and giving yourself away.",
    "Now, I\u2019m alive through the agency",
    "of iron and contract work and appeals",
    "to the fallen\u0097angel and dusk\u0097",
    "but wet-winged and still without you,",
    "Miss Bliss, who took me inside",
    "where there was an ocean",
    "before which we were children.",
    "That calm, that fear,",
    "that witness of the two-thirds",
    "of everything else."

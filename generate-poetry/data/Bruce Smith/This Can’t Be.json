    "the place of consequence, the station of his embrace.",
    "Or else I\u2019m not son enough to see",
    "the innocence and the spiritual fiddlings",
    "in the uneven floorboards and joists,",
    "in the guttural speech of the pipes,",
    "in the limp and the lack of heat.",
    "All we need, all we really need is light!",
    "And let there be a roof with no leaks.",
    "Oh father landlord, fill up all our breaches.",
    "He gives himself to the cracks; into the chinks",
    "my father lowers his bone,",
    "the do-it-yourself funeral. He holds the wires",
    "in his teeth. He strips the insulation back.",
    "If it\u2019s black, it\u2019s juiceless; if it\u2019s red, elegiac."

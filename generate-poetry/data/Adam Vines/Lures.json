    "Last summer\u2019s fishing failures dangled from trees:",
    "a Rapala and Jitterbug a stand",
    "of privet paid for, half-ounce jigs with rubber skirts",
    "and jelly worms with wide-gap hooks on ten-pound test",
    "we tithed with overzealous casts at bass.",
    "Then off we\u2019d go (our stringers bare) to find",
    "a yard to cut, a truck to wash, so we could fill",
    "the tackle box we shared again. Today",
    "is 12/12/12, the Mayan end, and I,",
    "a country boy in Brooklyn for the week,",
    "will hail a cab for the first time and think",
    "of cows unnerved by fish we missed",
    "and shouts of \u201cshit\u201d that followed, and dawns to dusks",
    "and always back with you, my childhood friend.",
    "Our girls will never know that pond\u2019s deep hole",
    "a baseball diamond now fills \u2014 the city leaders\u2019 bright",
    "idea \u2014 or how their fathers sitting in the bleachers",
    "on Saturdays a couple decades later",
    "can almost feel the stinging nettle against",
    "their thighs, the lunker largemouth sweeping the bed",
    "with her tail while plastic lizards jerk and drag",
    "across the third base line, or how when we",
    "untrain our ears to baseballs cracking bats",
    "and bitchy parents, called strikes and alike,",
    "we hear the peepers sounding off in oaks",
    "on down the way, our mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 voices",
    "calling us home not too far behind or ahead."

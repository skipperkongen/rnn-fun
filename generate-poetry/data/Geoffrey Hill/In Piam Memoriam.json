    "Created purely from glass the saint stands,",
    "Exposing his gifted quite empty hands",
    "Like a conjurer about to begin,",
    "A righteous man begging of righteous men.",
    "2",
    "In the sun lily-and-gold-coloured,",
    "Filtering the cruder light, he has endured,",
    "A feature for our regard; and will keep;",
    "Of worldly purity the stained archetype.",
    "3",
    "The scummed pond twitches. The great holly-tree,",
    "Emptied and shut, blows clear of wasting snow,",
    "The common, puddled substance: beneath,",
    "Like a revealed mineral, a new earth."

    "When snow like sheep lay in the fold",
    "And winds went begging at each door,",
    "And the far hills were blue with cold,",
    "And a cold shroud lay on the moor,",
    "She kept the siege. And every day",
    "We watched her brooding over death",
    "Like a strong bird above its prey.",
    "The room filled with the kettle\u2019s breath.",
    "Damp curtains glued against the pane",
    "Sealed time away. Her body froze",
    "As if to freeze us all, and chain",
    "Creation to a stunned repose.",
    "She died before the world could stir.",
    "In March the ice unloosed the brook",
    "And water ruffled the sun\u2019s hair.",
    "Dead cones upon the alder shook."

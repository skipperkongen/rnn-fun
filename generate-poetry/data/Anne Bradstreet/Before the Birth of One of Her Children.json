    "All things within this fading world hath end,",
    "Adversity doth still our joyes attend;",
    "No ties so strong, no friends so dear and sweet,",
    "But with death\u2019s parting blow is sure to meet.",
    "The sentence past is most irrevocable,",
    "A common thing, yet oh inevitable.",
    "How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend,",
    "How soon\u2019t may be thy Lot to lose thy friend,",
    "We are both ignorant, yet love bids me",
    "These farewell lines to recommend to thee,",
    "That when that knot\u2019s untied that made us one,",
    "I may seem thine, who in effect am none.",
    "And if I see not half my dayes that\u2019s due,",
    "What nature would, God grant to yours and you;",
    "The many faults that well you know I have",
    "Let be interr\u2019d in my oblivious grave;",
    "If any worth or virtue were in me,",
    "Let that live freshly in thy memory",
    "And when thou feel\u2019st no grief, as I no harms,",
    "Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms.",
    "And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains",
    "Look to my little babes, my dear remains.",
    "And if thou love thyself, or loved\u2019st me,",
    "These o protect from step Dames injury.",
    "And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse,",
    "With some sad sighs honour my absent Herse;",
    "And kiss this paper for thy loves dear sake,",
    "Who with salt tears this last Farewel did take."

    "In silent night when rest I took,",
    "For sorrow near I did not look,",
    "I wakened was with thund\u2019ring noise",
    "And piteous shrieks of dreadful voice.",
    "That fearful sound of \u201cfire\u201d and \u201cfire,\u201d",
    "Let no man know is my Desire.",
    "I, starting up, the light did spy,",
    "And to my God my heart did cry",
    "To straighten me in my Distress",
    "And not to leave me succourless.",
    "Then, coming out, behold a space",
    "The flame consume my dwelling place.",
    "And when I could no longer look,",
    "I blest His name that gave and took,",
    "That laid my goods now in the dust.",
    "Yea, so it was, and so \u2018twas just.",
    "It was his own, it was not mine,",
    "Far be it that I should repine;",
    "He might of all justly bereft",
    "But yet sufficient for us left.",
    "When by the ruins oft I past",
    "My sorrowing eyes aside did cast",
    "And here and there the places spy",
    "Where oft I sate and long did lie.",
    "Here stood that trunk, and there that chest,",
    "There lay that store I counted best.",
    "My pleasant things in ashes lie",
    "And them behold no more shall I.",
    "Under thy roof no guest shall sit,",
    "Nor at thy Table eat a bit.",
    "No pleasant talk shall \u2018ere be told",
    "Nor things recounted done of old.",
    "No Candle e'er shall shine in Thee,",
    "Nor bridegroom\u2018s voice e'er heard shall be.",
    "In silence ever shalt thou lie,",
    "Adieu, Adieu, all\u2019s vanity.",
    "Then straight I \u2018gin my heart to chide,",
    "And did thy wealth on earth abide?",
    "Didst fix thy hope on mould'ring dust?",
    "The arm of flesh didst make thy trust?",
    "Raise up thy thoughts above the sky",
    "That dunghill mists away may fly.",
    "Thou hast a house on high erect",
    "Frameed by that mighty Architect,",
    "With glory richly furnished,",
    "Stands permanent though this be fled.",
    "It\u2018s purchased and paid for too",
    "By Him who hath enough to do.",
    "A price so vast as is unknown,",
    "Yet by His gift is made thine own;",
    "There\u2018s wealth enough, I need no more,",
    "Farewell, my pelf, farewell, my store.",
    "The world no longer let me love,",
    "My hope and treasure lies above."

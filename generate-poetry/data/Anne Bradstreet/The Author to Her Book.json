    "Thou ill-form\u2019d offspring of my feeble brain,",
    "Who after birth didst by my side remain,",
    "Till snatched from thence by friends, less wise than true,",
    "Who thee abroad, expos\u2019d to publick view,",
    "Made thee in raggs, halting to th\u2019 press to trudge,",
    "Where errors were not lessened (all may judg).",
    "At thy return my blushing was not small,",
    "My rambling brat (in print) should mother call,",
    "I cast thee by as one unfit for light,",
    "Thy Visage was so irksome in my sight;",
    "Yet being mine own, at length affection would",
    "Thy blemishes amend, if so I could:",
    "I wash\u2019d thy face, but more defects I saw,",
    "And rubbing off a spot, still made a flaw.",
    "I stretched thy joynts to make thee even feet,",
    "Yet still thou run\u2019st more hobling then is meet;",
    "In better dress to trim thee was my mind,",
    "But nought save home-spun Cloth, i\u2019 th\u2019 house I find.",
    "In this array \u2019mongst Vulgars mayst thou roam.",
    "In Criticks hands, beware thou dost not come;",
    "And take thy way where yet thou art not known,",
    "If for thy Father askt, say, thou hadst none:",
    "And for thy Mother, she alas is poor,",
    "Which caus\u2019d her thus to send thee out of door."

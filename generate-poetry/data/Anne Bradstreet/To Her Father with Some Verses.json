    "Most truly honoured, and as truly dear,",
    "If worth in me or ought I do appear,",
    "Who can of right better demand the same",
    "Than may your worthy self from whom it came?",
    "The principal might yield a greater sum,",
    "Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb;",
    "My stock's so small I know not how to pay,",
    "My bond remains in force unto this day;",
    "Yet for part payment take this simple mite,",
    "Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right.",
    "Such is my debt I may not say forgive,",
    "But as I can, I'll pay it while I live;",
    "Such is my bond, none can discharge but I,",
    "Yet paying is not paid until I die."

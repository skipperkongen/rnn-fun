    "Watch the fire undress him,",
    "how flame fingers each button,",
    "rolls back his collar, unzips him",
    "without sweet talk or mystery.",
    "See how the skin begins to gather",
    "at his ankles, how it slips into",
    "the embers, how it shimmers",
    "beneath him, unshapen, iridescent",
    "as candlelight on a dark negligee.",
    "Come, look at him, at all his goods,",
    "how his whole body becomes song,",
    "an aria of light, a psalm\u2019s kaleidoscope.",
    "Listen as he lets loose an opus,",
    "night\u2019s national anthem, the tune",
    "you can\u2019t name, but can\u2019t stop humming.",
    "There, he burns brilliant as a blue note."

    "He promises a canary dress, white gloves,",
    "says they\u2019ll eat chops, thick as her thighs,",
    "that they\u2019ll order doubles of the \u201cfinest,\u201d",
    "see all the Big Names when they arrive.",
    "But it\u2019s the thought of them dead:",
    "half of what they own draped around them,",
    "her head against his chest, his back slack",
    "against the headboard, all their letters unopened,",
    "bills not paid, long knocks, the notices tacked",
    "outside their door. It\u2019s not knowing",
    "whether some smell would introduce them",
    "to their neighbors or a landlord wheeling",
    "them out into the hallway; the highboy",
    "he chipped on the drive up, the silver",
    "she inherited from her mother, her hatboxes,",
    "stacked high next to them like a wedding cake",
    "waiting to be buried. He heard that \u201cup there\u201d",
    "the wind had talons sharp enough to hook",
    "a grown man beneath his collarbone and carry",
    "him a full city block. He heard that you learned",
    "the months by measuring the length of their shadows",
    "and even summer was like a quality of night."

    "So the world, it was concluded,",
    "was three days wide",
    "in each direction,",

    "would sail furiously,",
    "trying to go off the deep end.",
    "Yo-ho-ho, would say the sailors,",
    "for six days.",
    "While on the shore their women moaned.",
    "For years, their boats were slow,",
    "and all show.",
    "And they turned into families",
    "on the only land they knew."

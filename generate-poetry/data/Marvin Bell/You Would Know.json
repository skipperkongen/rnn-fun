    "That you, Father, are \u201cin my mind,\u201d",
    "some will argue, who cherish the present",
    "but flee the past. They haven\u2019t my need",
    "to ask, What was I? Asking instead,",
    "What am I?, they see themselves bejeweled",
    "and wing\u00e8d. Because they would fly and have value,",
    "their answers are pretty but false:",

    "preferring their stones to brains.",
    "The brain, remember, is not foolproof",

    "Sodden, quivering, crossed and recrossed,",
    "the mind can become a headstone",
    "or be malice stuffed with fish.",
    "Everything changes so quickly. You who were",
    "are no longer and what I was I\u2019m not.",
    "Am I to know myself, except as I was?",
    "The rest is catchy, self-promising, false.",
    "Oh please write to me, and tell me.",
    "I just want to be happy again. That\u2019s",
    "what I was, happy, maybe am, you would know."

    "Sleeping sister of a farther sky,",
    "dropped from zenith like a tender tone,",
    "the lucid apex of a scale unknown",
    "whose whitest whisper is an opaque cry",
    "of measureless frequency, the spectral sigh",
    "you breath, bright hydrogen and brighter zone",
    "of fissured carbon, consummated moan",
    "and ceaseless rapture of a brilliant why.",
    "Will nothing wake you from your livid rest?",
    "Essence of ether and astral stone",
    "the stunned polarities your substance weaves",
    "in one bright making, like a dream of leaves",
    "in the tree\u2019s mind, summered. Or as a brooding bone",
    "roots constellations in the body\u2019s nest."

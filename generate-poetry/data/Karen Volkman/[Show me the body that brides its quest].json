    "Show me the body that brides its quest,",
    "that sleeps its seemings, tremblant inconnue,",
    "jeweled Ophelia of diaphanous hue",
    "in all her slippings, weed-wedded, water-dressed,",
    "the sluice and swooning of her semblant rest\u2014",
    "the river ruptures, the weeds branch blue\u2014",
    "day\u2019s jaune eyes (wide lucencies) bleed new",
    "hollow spaces where the breathings nest,",
    "irised mnemosyne, rumored as a rune.",
    "Oh roared red pulse, errata, when you die",
    "maiden-postured, murmur in the wrist,",
    "tendrilled syllables the waters twist,",
    "or innered element (it is an I)",
    "the dead girl blurring in the blooded noon."

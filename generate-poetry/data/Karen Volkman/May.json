    "In May\u2019s gaud gown and ruby reckoning",
    "the old saw wind repeats a colder thing.",
    "Says, you are the bluest body I ever seen.",
    "Says, dance that skeletal startle the way I might.",
    "Radius, ulna, a catalogue of flex.",
    "What do you think you\u2019re grabbing",
    "with those gray hands? What do you think",
    "you\u2019re hunting, cat-mouth creeling",
    "in the mouseless dawn? Pink as meat",
    "in the butcher\u2019s tender grip, white as",
    "the opal of a thigh you smut the lie on.",
    "In May\u2019s red ruse and smattered ravishings",
    "you one, you two, you three your cruder schemes,",
    "you blanch black lurk and blood the pallid bone",
    "and hum scald need where the body says",
    "and the rose sighs",
    "in the pleatpetal purring of mouthweathered May."

    "My father at the dictionary-stand",
    "Touches the page to fully understand",
    "The lamplit answer, tilting in his hand",
    "His slowly scanning magnifying lens,",
    "A blurry, glistening circle he suspends",
    "Above the word \u201cCarnation.\u201d Then he bends",
    "So near his eyes are magnified and blurred,",
    "One finger on the miniature word,",
    "As if he touched a single key and heard",
    "A distant, plucked, infinitesimal string,",
    "\u201cThe obligation due to every thing",
    "That\u2019s smaller than the universe.\u201d I bring",
    "My sewing needle close enough that I",
    "Can watch my father through the needle\u2019s eye,",
    "As through a lens ground for a butterfly",
    "Who peers down flower-hallways toward a room",
    "Shadowed and fathomed as this study\u2019s gloom",
    "Where, as a scholar bends above a tomb",
    "To read what\u2019s buried there, he bends to pore",
    "Over the Latin blossom. I am four,",
    "I spill my pins and needles on the floor",
    "Trying to stitch \u201cBeloved\u201d X by X.",
    "My dangerous, bright needle\u2019s point connects",
    "Myself illiterate to this perfect text",
    "I cannot read. My father puzzles why",
    "It is my habit to identify",
    "Carnations as \u201cChrist\u2019s flowers,\u201d knowing I",
    "Can give no explanation but \u201cBecause.\u201d",
    "Word-roots blossom in speechless messages",
    "The way the thread behind my sampler does",
    "Where following each X I awkward move",
    "My needle through the word whose root is love.",
    "He reads, \u201cA pink variety of Clove,",
    ", the Latin, meaning flesh.\u201d",
    "As if the bud\u2019s essential oils brush",
    "Christ\u2019s fragrance through the room, the iron-fresh",
    "Odor carnations have floats up to me,",
    "A drifted, secret, bitter ecstasy,",
    "The stems squeak in my scissors,",
    "He turns the page to \u201cClove\u201d and reads aloud:",
    "\u201cThe clove, a spice, dried from a flower-bud.\u201d",
    "Then twice, as if he hasn't understood,",
    "He reads, \u201cFrom French, for",
    ", meaning a nail.\u201d",
    "He gazes, motionless. \u201cMeaning a nail.\u201d",
    "The incarnation blossoms, flesh and nail,",
    "I twist my threads like stems into a knot",
    "And smooth \u201cBeloved,\u201d but my needle caught",
    "Within the threads,",
    "The needle strikes my finger to the bone.",
    "I lift my hand, it is myself I\u2019ve sewn,",
    "The flesh laid bare, the threads of blood my own,",
    "I lift my hand in startled agony",
    "And call upon his name, \u201cDaddy daddy\u201d\u2014",
    "My father\u2019s hand touches the injury",
    "As lightly as he touched the page before,",
    "Where incarnation bloomed from roots that bore",
    "The flowers I called Christ\u2019s when I was four."

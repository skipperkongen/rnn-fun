    "To brush up on Sonata structure: first,",
    "The Exposition sounds two melodies,",
    "Deeply dissimilar, in different keys,",
    "Major and minor. Part Two is a burst",
    "Of brainstorms scholars call Development,",
    "In which the two themes of the Exposition",

    "Of Being There, and since they\u2019re fundamental,",
    "Why, then, the world\u2019s a dream, and dreams are mental,",
    "And since in mental matters East or West",
    "I need you for this dream\u2019s interpretation\u2014",
    "Stop looking at your watch, for I\u2019ve divined,",

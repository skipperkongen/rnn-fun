    "But when arrested for that behavior",
    "Says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything, my reps",
    "Did it. Well they did. These humans",
    "Committed their tiny crimes in the mail,\u201d it says,",
    "\u201cKnowing animals are photogenic. You can hold",
    "One in your lap or hold a sheaf of photos",
    "In which a feline looks like you yourself tearing off a leg",
    "Of a springbok antelope, which prey looks like you",
    "Concentrating on the flee instinct,\u201d it says.",
    "I tend to agree with it. It and",
    "All of them have expressions on their faces, four limbs,",
    "Two eyes, noses, ears, etcetera, how close can you get to you",

    "Bite it, and cook it. You do that, tonight",
    "For instance. If one of us eats the other",
    "It\u2019s a very big crime",
    "Not tiny like the revolutionary revelation in a solicitation",
    "That we are like the animals, no,",
    "them,",
    "Which is bigger in evolution and spirituality,",
    "Sure, and in the final accounting",
    "Much more important, but today",
    "Don\u2019t put a cheetah in your lap and don\u2019t eat other humans."

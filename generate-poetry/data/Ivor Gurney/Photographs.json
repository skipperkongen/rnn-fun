    "Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;",
    "Watching the candle guttering in the draught;",
    "Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily",
    "Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed",
    "With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,",
    "All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;",
    "Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;",
    "Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,",
    "Though in a picture only, a common cheap",
    "Ill-taken card; and children\u2014frozen, some",
    "(Babies) waiting on Dicky-bird to peep",
    "Out of the handkerchief that is his home",
    "(But he's so shy!). And some with bright looks, calling",
    "Delight across the miles of land and sea,",
    "That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling",
    "Could quite blot out\u2014not mud nor lethargy.",
    "Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O",
    "The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things!",
    "Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow",
    "Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.",
    "But once\u2014O why did he keep that bitter token",
    "Of a dead Love?\u2014that boy, who, suddenly moved,",
    "Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,",
    "A girl who better had not been beloved."

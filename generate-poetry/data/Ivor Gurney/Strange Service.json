    "Little did I dream, England, that you bore me",
    "I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service,",
    "Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly,",
    "Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools",
    "Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ...",
    "But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being,",
    "And uses consecrate.",
    "Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you",
    "In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters;",
    "None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice;",
    "None, but you, repay."

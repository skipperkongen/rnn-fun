    "As I went up by Ovillers",
    "In mud and water cold to the knee,",
    "There went three jeering, fleering spectres,",
    "That walked abreast and talked of me.",
    "The first said, \u2018Here\u2019s a right brave soldier",
    "That walks the dark unfearingly;",
    "Soon he\u2019ll come back on a fine stretcher,",
    "And laughing for a nice Blighty.\u2019",
    "The second, \u2018Read his face, old comrade,",
    "No kind of lucky chance I see;",
    "One day he\u2019ll freeze in mud to the marrow,",
    "Then look his last on Picardie.\u2019",
    "Though bitter the word of these first twain",
    "Curses the third spat venomously;",
    "\u2018He\u2019ll stay untouched till the war\u2019s last dawning",
    "Then live one hour of agony.\u2019",
    "Liars the first two were. Behold me",
    "At sloping arms by one \u2013 two \u2013 three;",
    "Waiting the time I shall discover",
    "Whether the third spake verity."

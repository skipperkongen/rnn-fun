    "I don\u2019t know when it slipped into my speech",
    "that soft word meaning, \u201cif God wills it.\u201d",
    "Insha\u2019Allah I will see you next summer.",
    "The baby will come in spring, insha\u2019Allah.",
    "Insha\u2019Allah this year we will have enough rain.",
    "So many plans I\u2019ve laid have unraveled",
    "easily as braids beneath my mother\u2019s quick fingers.",
    "Every language must have a word for this. A word",
    "our grandmothers uttered under their breath",
    "as they pinned the whites, soaked in lemon,",
    "hung them to dry in the sun, or peeled potatoes,",
    "dropping the discarded skins into a bowl.",
    "How lightly we learn to hold hope,",
    "as if it were an animal that could turn around",
    "and bite your hand. And still we carry it",
    "the way a mother would, carefully,",
    "from one day to the next."

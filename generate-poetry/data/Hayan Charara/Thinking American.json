    "But that\u2019s where you stood",
    "before a mirror in the dark,",
    "where you were too tired",
    "to complain. You never go back.",
    "Things could be worse. Maybe.",
    "Detroit is a shithole, it\u2019s where",
    "you were pulled from the womb",
    "into the streets. Listen,",
    "when I say Detroit, I mean any place.",

    "Thyrsis, a youth of the inspired train,",
    "Fair Sacharissa lov\u2019d, but lov\u2019d in vain;",
    "Like Ph\u0153bus sung the no less amorous boy;",
    "Like Daphne she, as lovely, and as coy;",
    "With numbers he the flying nymph pursues,",
    "With numbers such as Ph\u0153bus\u2019 self might use;",
    "Such is the chase when Love and Fancy leads,",
    "O\u2019er craggy mountains, and through flow\u2019ry meads;",
    "Invok\u2019d to testify the lover\u2019s care,",
    "Or form some image of his cruel fair:",
    "Urg\u2019d with his fury, like a wounded deer,",
    "O\u2019er these he fled; and now approaching near,",
    "Had reach\u2019d the nymph with his harmonious lay,",
    "Whom all his charms could not incline to stay.",
    "Yet what he sung in his immortal strain,",
    "Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain;",
    "All but the nymph that should redress his wrong,",
    "Attend his passion, and approve his song.",
    "Like Ph\u0153bus thus, acquiring unsought praise,",
    "He catch\u2019d at love, and fill\u2019d his arm with bays."

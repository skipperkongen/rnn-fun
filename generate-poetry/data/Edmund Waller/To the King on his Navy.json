    "Where\u2019er thy navy spreads her canvas wings,",
    "Homage to thee, and peace to all, she brings:",
    "The French and Spaniard, when thy flags appear,",
    "Forget their hatred, and consent to fear.",
    "So Jove from Ida did both hosts survey,",
    "And when he pleas\u2019d to thunder, part the fray.",
    "Ships heretofore in seas like fishes sped,",
    "The mightiest still upon the smallest fed:",
    "Thou on the deep imposest nobler laws,",
    "And by that justice hast remov\u2019d the cause",
    "Of those rude tempests, which, for rapine sent,",
    "Too oft, alas, involv\u2019d the innocent.",
    "Now shall the ocean, as thy Thames, be free",
    "From both those fates, of storms and piracy.",
    "But we most happy, who can fear no force",
    "But winged troops, or Pegasean horse:",
    "\u2019Tis not so hard for greedy foes to spoil",
    "Another nation, as to touch our soil.",
    "Should Nature\u2019s self invade the world again,",
    "And o\u2019er the centre spread the liquid main,",
    "Thy power were safe; and her destructive hand",
    "Would but enlarge the bounds of thy command:",
    "Thy dreadful fleet would style thee lord of all,",
    "And ride in triumph o\u2019er the drowned ball:",
    "Those towers of oak o\u2019er fertile plains might go,",
    "And visit mountains, where they once did grow.",
    "The world\u2019s restorer once could not endure,",
    "That finish\u2019d Babel should those men secure,",
    "Whose pride design\u2019d that fabric to have stood",
    "Above the reach of any second flood:",
    "To thee His chosen, more indulgent, He",
    "Dares trust such power with so much piety."

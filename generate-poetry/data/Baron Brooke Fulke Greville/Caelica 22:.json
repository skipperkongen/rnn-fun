    "I, with whose colours Myra dress\u2019d her head,",
    "I, that ware posies of her own hand-making,",
    "I, that mine own name in the chimneys read",
    "By Myra finely wrought ere I was waking:",
    "Must I look on, in hope time coming may",
    "With change bring back my turn again to play?",
    "I, that on Sunday at the church-stile found",
    "A garland sweet, with true-love knots in flowers,",
    "Which I to wear about mine arm was bound,",
    "That each of us might know that all was ours:",
    "Must I now lead an idle life in wishes,",
    "And follow Cupid for his loaves and fishes?",
    "I, that did wear the ring her mother left,",
    "I, for whose love she gloried to be blamed,",
    "I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft,",
    "I, who did make her blush when I was named:",
    "Must I lose ring, flowers, blush, theft, and go naked,",
    "Watching with sighs till dead love be awaked?",
    "I, that, when drowsy Argus fell asleep,",
    "Like jealousy o\u2019erwatched with desire,",
    "Was even warned modesty to keep,",
    "While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature\u2019s fire:",
    "Must I look on a-cold, while others warm them?",
    "Do Vulcan\u2019s brothers in such fine nets arm them?",
    "Was it for this that I might Myra see",
    "Washing the water with her beauties white?",
    "Yet would she never write her love to me.",
    "Thinks wit of change, while thoughts are in delight?",
    "Mad girls must safely love as they may leave;",
    "No man can print a kiss: lines may deceive."

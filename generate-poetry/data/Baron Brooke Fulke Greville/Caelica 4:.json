    "You little stars that live in skies",
    "And glory in Apollo\u2019s glory,",
    "In whose asp\u00e8cts conjoin\u00e8d lies",
    "The heaven\u2019s will and nature\u2019s story,",
    "Joy to be likened to those eyes,",
    "Which eyes make all eyes glad or sorry;",
    "For when you force thoughts from above,",
    "These overrule your force by love.",
    "And thou, O Love, which in these eyes",
    "Hast married Reason with Affection,",
    "And made them saints of Beauty\u2019s skies,",
    "Where joys are shadows of perfection,",
    "Lend me thy wings that I may rise",
    "Up, not by worth, but thy election;",
    "For I have vowed in strangest fashion",
    "To love and never seek compassion."

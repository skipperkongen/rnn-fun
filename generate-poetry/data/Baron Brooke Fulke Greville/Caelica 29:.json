    "The nurse-life wheat within his green husk growing,",
    "Flatters our hope, and tickles our desire,",
    "Nature\u2019s true riches in sweet beauties showing,",
    "Which sets all hearts, with labor\u2019s love, on fire.",
    "No less fair is the wheat when golden ear",
    "Shows unto hope the joys of near enjoying;",
    "Fair and sweet is the bud, more sweet and fair",
    "the rose, which proves that time is not destroying.",
    "Caelica, your youth, the morning of delight,",
    "Enamel\u2019d o\u2019er with beauties white and red,",
    "All sense and thoughts did to belief invite,",
    "That love and glory there are brought to bed;",
    "And your ripe year\u2019s love-noon; he goes no higher,",
    "Turns all the spirits of man into desire."

    "You only have to make her one grilled cheese",
    "in the suffocating heat of summer",
    "while still wearing your wet swim trunks",
    "to know what it\u2019s like to be in love.",
    "And you only have to sit once",
    "for a haircut in the air conditioning",
    "with the lovely stylist to forget all about it,",
    "and to forget that anything in the universe",
    "ever existed prior to the small, pink sweater",
    "now brushing softly against your neck.",
    "In this world, every birth is premature.",
    "How else to explain all of this silence,",
    "all of this screaming,",
    "all of those Christmas card letters",
    "about how well the kids are doing in school?",
    "We\u2019re all struggling to say the same old things",
    "in new and different ways.",
    "And so we must praise the new and different ways.",
    "I don\u2019t like Christmas.",
    "I miss you that much.",
    "For I, too, have heard the screaming,",
    "and I, too, have tried to let it pass,",
    "and still I\u2019ve been up half the night",
    "as if I were half this old,",
    "and like you, I hate this kind of poetry",
    "just as much as my life depends upon it.",
    "They\u2019re giving away tiny phones for free these days,",
    "but they\u2019ve only made",
    "a decent conversation more precious.",
    "One medicine stops the swelling,",
    "another medicine stops the first medicine.",
    "Just like you, I entered this world",
    "mad and kicking, and without you,",
    "it\u2019s precisely how I intend to go."

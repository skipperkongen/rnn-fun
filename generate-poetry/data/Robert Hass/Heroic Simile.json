    "When the swordsman fell in Kurosawa\u2019s",
    "in the gray rain,",
    "in the Cinemascope and the Tokugawa dynasty,",
    "he fell straight as a pine, he fell",
    "as Ajax fell in Homer",
    "in chanted dactyls and the tree was so huge",
    "the woodsman returned for two days",
    "to that lucky place before he was done with the sawing",
    "and on the third day he brought his uncle.",
    "They stacked logs in the resinous air,",
    "hacking the small limbs off,",
    "tying those bundles separately.",
    "The slabs near the root",
    "were quartered and still they were awkwardly large;",
    "the logs from the midtree they halved:",
    "ten bundles and four great piles of fragrant wood,",
    "moons and quarter moons and half moons",
    "ridged by the saw\u2019s tooth.",
    "The woodsman and the old man his uncle",
    "are standing in midforest",
    "on a floor of pine silt and spring mud.",
    "They have stopped working",
    "because they are tired and because",
    "I have imagined no pack animal",
    "or primitive wagon. They are too canny",
    "to call in neighbors and come home",
    "with a few logs after three days\u2019 work.",
    "They are waiting for me to do something",
    "or for the overseer of the Great Lord",
    "to come and arrest them.",
    "How patient they are!",
    "The old man smokes a pipe and spits.",
    "The young man is thinking he would be rich",
    "if he were already rich and had a mule.",
    "Ten days of hauling",
    "and on the seventh day they\u2019ll probably",
    "be caught, go home empty-handed",
    "or worse. I don\u2019t know",
    "whether they\u2019re Japanese or Mycenaean",
    "and there\u2019s nothing I can do.",
    "The path from here to that village",
    "is not translated. A hero, dying,",
    "gives off stillness to the air.",
    "A man and a woman walk from the movies",
    "to the house in the silence of separate fidelities.",
    "There are limits to imagination."

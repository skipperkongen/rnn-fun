    "When I looked at",
    "his streaky glasses, I wanted",
    "to leave him.",
    "He stole those",
    "cherries for me at midnight. We were walking",
    "in the rain and I loved him.",
    "I saw him coming",
    "toward me that time at the picnic,",
    "edgy, foreign.",
    "He sat in his room with",
    "the shades drawn, brooding.",
    "He gave me",
    "a photo of himself at sixteen, diving",
    "from the pier. It was summer. His arms",
    "outstretched.",
    "His mother was combing his soft curls",
    "with her fingers and crying. Crying.",
    "He put on the straw hat",
    "and raced me to the barn.",
    "Here\u2019s the dried rose, brown",
    "as tobacco. Here\u2019s the letter that I tore",
    "and pasted. The book of blank pages",
    "with the velvet cover.",
    "When I rub the nap",
    "backwards, the colors lift,",
    "bristle.",
    "Sometimes, when I\u2019m all alone,",
    "I find myself stroking it."

    "Two floors up, at the corner of Hearst and Shattuck,",
    "he\u2019s clamped for good",
    "in an iron lung. When it\u2019s time to eat",
    "he nudges his head a sweaty mile",
    "to the edge of the pillow. It takes a while.",
    "His brilliant bloodshot light-blue eyes",
    "steer me from cupboard to fridge:",
    "he would like his chicken burrito",
    "cut into bite-size pieces,",
    "a bent straw for his glass of water, please.",
    "How does the body live its only life",
    "in a cage? I watch him compute the distance",
    "from bar to bar, and squeeze",
    "between them",
    "with a violent compression, a fury of bursting free",
    "that doesn\u2019t last.",
    "His will is a crowbar, angled to pry up",
    "the rooted intractable weight",
    "of matter. I watch him slyly, I check out",
    "the way he does it. He",
    "does it. But pain in its absolute privacy",
    "weighs what it weighs.",
    "I come here to study the soul, posing one question",
    "a dozen ways, most of them silent.",
    "\u201cIf I\u2019m only a body,\u201d he laughs,",
    "\u201cI\u2019m up shit creek.\u201d His laugh",
    "a gritty eruption of rock, salt and breath.",
    "Like me he writes poems",
    "but he does it letter by letter",
    "on a propped keyboard, the mouth-stick",
    "wobbling between his teeth.",
    "That kind of speed keeps a poet accountable.",
    "He won\u2019t ever say, \u201cThe grass is very green\u201d",
    "when it\u2019s only green."

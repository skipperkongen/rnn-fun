    "In reality my loves",
    "are the strange box of a Polish doll",
    "The blonde\u2019s eyes appearing",
    "fixed to her hips long after midnight",
    "the garret always singular to loosen",
    "a massive mane",
    "across her back, its strands",
    "thick and fine draping",
    "her otter-like chin",
    "Deliberately she\u2019d peer out from the wall",
    "and nothing could be seen but the shadow of her breasts",
    "hidden beneath marmots of hair",
    "And lovely was her skin\u2019s radiance",
    "at that unusual hour",
    "Her waist\u2019s digressions",
    "easily discerned",
    "as bees through grass",
    "the window neither open nor closed",
    "What I saw, yellow like crystal,",
    "rose from sleepy thighs",
    "amassed in unseemly tourniquets",
    "Everything before me, a pale shimmer",
    "of hairs fanning delicately",
    "to reveal the pink or green skin I no longer know",
    "of hips a million centimeters",
    "from my gaze."

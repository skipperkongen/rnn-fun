    "It is autumn but early. No crow cries from the dry woods.",
    "The house droops like an eyelid over the leprous hill.",
    "In the bald barnyard one horse, a collection of angles",
    "Cuts at the flies with a spectral tail. A blind man\u2019s",
    "Sentence, the road goes on. Lifts as the slope lifts it.",
    "Comes now one who has been conquered",
    "By all he sees. And asks what\u2014would have what\u2014",
    "Poor fool, frail, this man, mistake, my hero?",
    "More than the hands on the lines and the back aching,",
    "The daily wrestle with the angel in the south forty,",
    "More than this forever lonely round",
    "Round hunger and impotence, the prickly pair:",
    "Banker or broker can have dreamed no fate",
    "More bankrupt than this godlike heresy",
    "Which asks of love more leave than extended credit,",
    "Needs comradeship more than a psalm or surely these",
    "Worn acres even if over them",
    "Those trained to it see signs of they say God."

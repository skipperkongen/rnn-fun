    "All night long I hear the sleepers toss",
    "Between the darkened window and the wall.",
    "The madman\u2019s whimper and the lover\u2019s voice,",
    "The worker\u2019s whisper and the sick child\u2019s call\u2014",
    "Knowing them all",
    "I\u2019d walk a mile, maybe, hearing some cat",
    "Crying its guts out, to throttle it by hand,",
    "Such simple love I had. I wished I might\u2014",
    "Or God might\u2014answer each call in person and",
    "Each poor demand.",
    "Well, I\u2019d have been better off sleeping myself.",
    "These fancies had some sentimental charm,",
    "But love without direction is a cheap blanket",
    "And even if it did no one any harm,",
    "No one is warm."

    "When your admirals are drowning in the grass-green sea,",
    "When your generals are preparing the total catastrophe\u2014",
    "I just want you to know how you can not count on me.",
    "I have ridden to hounds through my ancestral halls,",
    "I have picked the eternal crocus on the ultimate hill,",
    "I have fallen through the window of the highest room,",
    "But don\u2019",
    "Sirs, when you move that map-pin how many souls must dance?",
    "I don\u2019t think all those soldiers have died by happenstance.",
    "The inscrutable look on your scrutable face I can read at a glance\u2014",

    "I\u2019ll sent you a picture postcard from somewhere I can\u2019t be found.",
    "I have discovered the grammar of the Public Good,",
    "I have invented a language that can",
    "I have found the map of where the body is hid,",
    "And I won\u2019t be caught dead in your",
    "O hygienic inventer of the bomb that\u2019s so clean,",
    "O lily white Senator from East Turnip Green,",
    "O celestial mechanic of the money machine\u2014",

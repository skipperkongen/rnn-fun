    "I don\u2019t belong in this century\u2014who does?",
    "In my time, summer came someplace in June\u2014",
    "The cutbanks blazing with roses, the birds brazen, and the astonished",
    "Pastures frisking with young calves . . .",
    "That was in the country\u2014",
    "I don\u2019t mean",
    "country, I mean in the",
    ":",
    "And the country is lost. I don\u2019t mean just lost to",
    ",",
    "Nor in the way of metaphorical loss\u2014it\u2019s lost that way too\u2014",
    "No; nor in no sort of special case: I mean",
    "Now, down below, in the fire and stench, the city",
    "Is building its shell: elaborate levels of emptiness",
    "Like some sea-animal building toward its extinction.",
    "And the citizens, unserious and full of virtue,",
    "Are hunting for bread, or money, or a prayer,",
    "And I behold them, and this season of man, without love.",
    "If it were not a joke, it would be proper to laugh.",
    "\u2014Curious how that rat\u2019s nest holds together\u2014",
    "Distracting . . .",
    "Without it there might be, still,",
    "The gold wheel and the silver, the sun and the moon,",
    "The season\u2019s ancient assurance under the unstable stars",
    "Our fiery companions . . .",
    "And trees, perhaps, and the sound",
    "Of the wild and living water hurrying out of the hills.",
    "Without these, I have you for my talisman:",
    "Sun, moon, the four seasons,",
    "The true voice of the mountains. Now be",
    "(The city revolving in its empty shell,",
    "The night moving in from the East)",
    "\u2014Be thou these things."

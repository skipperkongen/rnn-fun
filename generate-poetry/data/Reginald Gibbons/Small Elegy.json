    "Someone has left us now",
    "before we have even touched hands.",
    "Getting lost in the pity of it",
    "sweeps you into an unknown stretch",
    "of canyon where oars thud",
    "against rock and rip free, you clutch",
    "at help, and even though",
    "you save yourself, the river",
    "funnels through the gorge",
    "and roars, roars, roars.",
    "Regret, a backwash of pain,",
    "one lost life swirls down rapids,",
    "rushes away, out of reach.",
    "It\u2019s not forgetting that you want \u2014",
    "it would be easy to drop",
    "one shoulder and dive, to come up",
    "gasping in a car on the way to work",
    "or blue in the face over the dishpan",
    "staring for who knows how long",
    "at a cup scoured clean under the suds.",
    "And not remembering.",
    "But the absence that is born",
    "must live as long as a man or a woman.",
    "There: it comes invisible headfirst,",
    "a bloodstreaked nothing, and is flushed away.",
    "While in the white room the dry light",
    "is cold; and waiting to be taken home",
    "mute ghosts lie in a row of empty cribs."

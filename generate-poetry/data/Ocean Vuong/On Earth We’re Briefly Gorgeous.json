    "Tell me it was for the hunger",
    "& nothing less. For hunger is to give",
    "the body what it knows",
    "it cannot keep. That this amber light",
    "whittled down by another war",
    "is all that pins my hand",
    "to your chest.",
    "between my arms \u2014",
    "stay.",
    "You, pushing your body",
    "into the river",
    "only to be left",
    "with yourself \u2014",
    "stay.",
    "I\u2019ll tell you how we\u2019re wrong enough to be forgiven. How one night, after",
    "backhanding",
    "mother, then taking a chainsaw to the kitchen table, my father went to kneel",
    "in the bathroom until we heard his muffled cries through the walls.",
    "And so I learned that a man, in climax, was the closest thing",
    "to surrender.",
    "Say surrender. Say alabaster. Switchblade.",
    "Honeysuckle. Goldenrod. Say autumn.",
    "Say autumn despite the green",
    "in your eyes. Beauty despite",
    "daylight. Say you\u2019d kill for it. Unbreakable dawn",
    "mounting in your throat.",
    "My thrashing beneath you",
    "like a sparrow stunned",
    "Dusk: a blade of honey between our shadows, draining.",
    "I wanted to disappear \u2014 so I opened the door to a stranger\u2019s car. He was divorced. He was still alive. He was sobbing into his hands (hands that tasted like rust). The pink breast cancer ribbon on his keychain swayed in the ignition. Don\u2019t we touch each other just to prove we are still here? I was still here once. The moon, distant & flickering, trapped itself in beads of sweat on my neck. I let the fog spill through the cracked window & cover my fangs. When I left, the Buick kept sitting there, a dumb bull in pasture, its eyes searing my shadow onto the side of suburban houses. At home, I threw myself on the bed like a torch & watched the flames gnaw through my mother\u2019s house until the sky appeared, bloodshot & massive. How I wanted to be that sky \u2014 to hold every flying & falling at once.",
    "Say amen. Say amend.",
    "Say yes. Say yes",
    "anyway.",
    "In the shower, sweating under cold water, I scrubbed & scrubbed.",
    "In the life before this one, you could tell",
    "two people were in love",
    "because when they drove the pickup",
    "over the bridge, their wings",
    "would grow back just in time.",
    "Some days I am still inside the pickup.",
    "Some days I keep waiting.",
    "It\u2019s not too late. Our heads haloed",
    "with gnats & summer too early",
    "to leave any marks.",
    "Your hand under my shirt as static",
    "intensifies on the radio.",
    "Your other hand pointing",
    "your daddy\u2019s revolver",
    "to the sky. Stars falling one",
    "by one in the cross hairs.",
    "This means I won\u2019t be",
    "afraid if we\u2019re already",
    "here. Already more",
    "than skin can hold. That a body",
    "beside a body",
    "must make a field",
    "full of ticking. That your name",
    "is only the sound of clocks",
    "being set back another hour",
    "& morning",
    "finds our clothes",
    "on your mother\u2019s front porch, shed",
    "like week-old lilies."

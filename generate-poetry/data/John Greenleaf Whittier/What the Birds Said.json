    "The birds against the April wind",
    "Flew northward, singing as they flew;",
    "They sang, \u201cThe land we leave behind",
    "Has swords for corn-blades, blood for dew.\u201d",
    "\u201cO wild-birds, flying from the South,",
    "What saw and heard ye, gazing down?\u201d",
    "\u201cWe saw the mortar\u2019s upturned mouth,",
    "The sickened camp, the blazing town!",
    "\u201cBeneath the bivouac\u2019s starry lamps,",
    "We saw your march-worn children die;",
    "In shrouds of moss, in cypress swamps,",
    "We saw your dead uncoffined lie.",
    "\u201cWe heard the starving prisoner\u2019s sighs",
    "And saw, from line and trench, your sons",
    "Follow our flight with home-sick eyes",
    "Beyond the battery\u2019s smoking guns.\u201d",
    "\u201cAnd heard and saw ye only wrong",
    "And pain,\u201d I cried, \u201cO wing-worn flocks?\u201d",
    "\u201cWe heard,\u201d they sang, \u201cthe freedman\u2019s song,",
    "The crash of Slavery\u2019s broken locks!",
    "\u201cWe saw from new, uprising States",
    "The treason-nursing mischief spurned,",
    "As, crowding Freedom\u2019s ample gates,",
    "The long-estranged and lost returned.",
    "\u201cO\u2019er dusky faces, seamed and old,",
    "And hands horn-hard with unpaid toil,",
    "With hope in every rustling fold,",
    "We saw your star-dropt flag uncoil.",
    "\u201cAnd struggling up through sounds accursed,",
    "A grateful murmur clomb the air;",
    "A whisper scarcely heard at first,",
    "It filled the listening heavens with prayer.",
    "\u201cAnd sweet and far, as from a star,",
    "Replied a voice which shall not cease,",
    "Till, drowning all the noise of war,",
    "It sings the blessed song of peace!\u201d",
    "So to me, in a doubtful day",
    "Of chill and slowly greening spring,",
    "Low stooping from the cloudy gray,",
    "The wild-birds sang or seemed to sing.",
    "They vanished in the misty air,",
    "The song went with them in their flight;",
    "But lo! they left the sunset fair,",
    "And in the evening there was light."

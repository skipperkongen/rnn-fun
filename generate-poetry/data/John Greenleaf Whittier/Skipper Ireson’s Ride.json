    "Of all the rides since the birth of time,",
    "Told in story or sung in rhyme, \u2014",
    "On Apuleius\u2019s Golden Ass,",
    "Or one-eyed Calender\u2019s horse of brass,",
    "Witch astride of a human back,",
    "Islam\u2019s prophet on Al-Bor\u00e1k, \u2014",
    "The strangest ride that ever was sped",
    "Was Ireson\u2019s, out from Marblehead!",
    "Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,",
    "Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart",
    "By the women of Marblehead!",
    "Body of turkey, head of owl,",
    "Wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl,",
    "Feathered and ruffled in every part,",
    "Skipper Ireson stood in the cart.",
    "Scores of women, old and young,",
    "Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue,",
    "Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane,",
    "Shouting and singing the shrill refrain:",
    "\u201cHere \u2019s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,",
    "Torr\u2019d an\u2019 futherr\u2019d an\u2019 corr\u2019d in a corrt",
    "By the women o\u2019 Morble\u2019ead!\u201d",
    "Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips,",
    "Girls in bloom of cheek and lips,",
    "Wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase",
    "Bacchus round some antique vase,",
    "Brief of skirt, with ankles bare,",
    "Loose of kerchief and loose of hair,",
    "With conch-shells blowing and fish-horns\u2019 twang,",
    "Over and over the M\u00e6nads sang:",
    "\u201cHere \u2019s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,",

    "By the women o\u2019 Morble\u2019ead!\u201d",
    "Small pity for him! \u2014 He sailed away",
    "From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay, \u2014",
    "Sailed away from a sinking wreck,",
    "With his own town\u2019s-people on her deck!",
    "\u201cLay by! lay by!\u201d they called to him.",
    "Back he answered, \u201cSink or swim!",
    "Brag of your catch of fish again!\u201d",
    "And off he sailed through the fog and rain!",
    "Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,",
    "Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart",
    "By the women of Marblehead!",
    "Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur",
    "That wreck shall lie forevermore.",
    "Mother and sister, wife and maid,",
    "Looked from the rocks of Marblehead",
    "Over the moaning and rainy sea, \u2014",
    "Looked for the coming that might not be!",
    "What did the winds and the sea-birds say",
    "Of the cruel captain who sailed away? \u2014",
    "Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,",
    "Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart",
    "By the women of Marblehead!",
    "Through the street, on either side,",
    "Up flew windows, doors swung wide;",
    "Sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray,",
    "Treble lent the fish-horn\u2019s bray.",
    "Sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound,",
    "Hulks of old sailors run aground,",
    "Shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane,",
    "And cracked with curses the hoarse refrain:",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,",

    "Sweetly along the Salem road",
    "Bloom of orchard and lilac showed.",
    "Little the wicked skipper knew",
    "Of the fields so green and the sky so blue.",
    "Riding there in his sorry trim,",
    "Like an Indian idol glum and grim,",
    "Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear",
    "Of voices shouting, far and near:",
    "\u201cHere\u2019s Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,",

    "\u201cHear me, neighbors!\u201d at last he cried, \u2014",
    "\u201cWhat to me is this noisy ride?",
    "What is the shame that clothes the skin",
    "To the nameless horror that lives within?",
    "Waking or sleeping, I see a wreck,",
    "And hear a cry from a reeling deck!",
    "Hate me and curse me, \u2014 I only dread",
    "The hand of God and the face of the dead!\u201d",
    "Said old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,",
    "Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart",
    "By the women of Marblehead!",
    "Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea",
    "Said, \u201cGod has touched him! why should we!\u201d",
    "Said an old wife mourning her only son,",
    "\u201cCut the rogue\u2019s tether and let him run!\u201d",
    "So with soft relentings and rude excuse,",
    "Half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose,",
    "And gave him a cloak to hide him in,",
    "And left him alone with his shame and sin.",
    "Poor Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,",
    "Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart",
    "By the women of Marblehead!"

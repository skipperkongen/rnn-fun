    "Still sits the school-house by the road,",
    "A ragged beggar sleeping;",
    "Around it still the sumachs grow,",
    "And blackberry-vines are creeping.",
    "Within, the master\u2019s desk is seen,",
    "Deep scarred by raps official;",
    "The warping floor, the battered seats,",
    "The jack-knife\u2019s carved initial;",
    "The charcoal frescos on its wall;",
    "Its door\u2019s worn sill, betraying",
    "The feet that, creeping slow to school,",
    "Went storming out to playing!",
    "Long years ago a winter sun",
    "Shone over it at setting;",
    "Lit up its western window-panes,",
    "And low eaves\u2019 icy fretting.",
    "It touched the tangled golden curls,",
    "And brown eyes full of grieving,",
    "Of one who still her steps delayed",
    "When all the school were leaving.",
    "For near her stood the little boy",
    "Her childish favor singled:",
    "His cap pulled low upon a face",
    "Where pride and shame were mingled.",
    "Pushing with restless feet the snow",
    "To right and left, he lingered;\u2014",
    "As restlessly her tiny hands",
    "The blue-checked apron fingered.",
    "He saw her lift her eyes; he felt",
    "The soft hand\u2019s light caressing,",
    "And heard the tremble of her voice,",
    "As if a fault confessing.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I spelt the word:",
    "I hate to go above you,",
    "Because,\u201d\u2014the brown eyes lower fell,\u2014",
    "\u201cBecause, you see, I love you!\u201d",
    "Still memory to a gray-haired man",
    "That sweet child-face is showing.",
    "Dear girl! the grasses on her grave",
    "Have forty years been growing!",
    "He lives to learn, in life\u2019s hard school,",
    "How few who pass above him",
    "Lament their triumph and his loss,",
    "Like her,\u2014because they love him."

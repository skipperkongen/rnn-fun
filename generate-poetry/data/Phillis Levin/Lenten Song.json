    "That the dead are real to us",
    "Cannot be denied,",
    "That the living are more real",
    "When they are dead",
    "Terrifies, that the dead can rise",
    "As the living do is possible",
    "Is possible to surmise,",
    "But all the stars cannot come near",
    "All we meet in an eye.",
    "Flee from me, fear, as soot",
    "Flies in a breeze, do not burn",
    "Or settle in my sight,",
    "I\u2019ve tasted you long enough,",
    "Let me savor",
    "Something otherwise.",
    "Who wakes beside me now",
    "Suits my soul, so I turn to words",
    "Only to say he changes",
    "Into his robe, rustles a page,",
    "He raises the lid of the piano",
    "To release what\u2019s born in its cage.",
    "If words come back",
    "To say they compromise",
    "Or swear again they have died,",
    "There\u2019s no news in that, I reply,",
    "But a music without notes",
    "These notes comprise, still",
    "As spring beneath us lies,",
    "Already something otherwise."

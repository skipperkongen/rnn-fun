    "That afternoon in mid-July,",
    "Two pilgrims watched from distant space",
    "The moon ballooning in the sky.",
    "They rose to meet it face-to-face.",
    "Their spidery spaceship,",
    "dropped",
    "Down gently on the lunar sand.",
    "And when the module's engines stopped,",
    "Rapt silence fell across the land.",
    "The first man down the ladder, Neil,",
    "Spoke words that we remember now\u2014",
    "\u201cOne small step...\u201d It made us feel",
    "As if we were there too, somehow.",
    "When Neil planted the flag and Buzz",
    "Collected lunar rocks and dust,",
    "They hopped like kangaroos because",
    "Of gravity. Or wanderlust?",
    "A quarter million miles away,",
    "One small blue planet watched in awe.",
    "And no one who was there that day",
    "Will soon forget the sight they saw."

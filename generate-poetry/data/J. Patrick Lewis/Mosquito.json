    "I was climbing up the sliding board",

    "A mosquito bite my bottom",

    "Still, there are mosquito manners,",
    "And I must have just forgot 'em.",
    "And I swear I'll never never never",
    "Bite another bottom.\u201d",
    "But a minute later Archie Hill",
    "And Buck and Theo Brown",
    "Were horsing on the monkey bars,",
    "Hanging upside down.",
    "They must have looked delicious",
    "From a skeeter's point of view",
    "'Cause he bit 'em on the bottoms,",
    "Archie, Buck and Theo too!",
    "You could hear 'em goin' HOLY!",
    "You could hear 'em goin' WHACK!",
    "You could hear 'em cuss and holler,",
    "Goin' smack, smack, smack.",
    "A mosquito's awful sneaky,",
    "A mosquito's mighty sly,",
    "But I never never never",
    "Thought a skeeter'd tell a lie."

    "Cold for so long, unable to speak,",
    "yet your mouth seems framed",
    "on a cry, or a stifled question.",
    "Who placed you here, and left you",
    "to this lonely eternity of ash and ice,",
    "and himself returned to the dust",
    "fields, the church and the temple?",
    "Was it God\u2014the sun-god of the Incas,",
    "the imperial god of the Spaniards?",
    "Or only the priests of that god,",
    "self-elected\u2014voice of the volcano",
    "that speaks once in a hundred years.",
    "And I wonder, with your image before me,",
    "what life might you have lived,",
    "had you lived at all\u2014whose companion,",
    "whose love? To be perhaps no more",
    "than a slave of that earthly master:",
    "a jug of water on your shoulder,",
    "year after stunted year, a bundle",
    "of reeds and corn, kindling",
    "for a fire on whose buried hearth?",
    "There were furies to be fed, then",
    "as now: blood to fatten the sun,",
    "a heart for the lightning to strike.",
    "And now the furies walk the streets,",
    "a swarm in the milling crowd.",
    "They stand to the podium, speak",
    "of their coming ascension ...",
    "Through all this drift and clamor",
    "you have survived\u2014in this cramped",
    "and haunted effigy, another entry",
    "on the historian\u2019s dated page.",
    "Under the weight of this mountain\u2014",
    "once a god, now only restless stone,",
    "we find your interrupted life,",
    "placed here among the trilobites",
    "and shells, so late unearthed."

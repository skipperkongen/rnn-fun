    "We boys, the neighborhood\u2019s barefoot",
    "We boys, the neighborhood\u2019s naked",
    "We boys of stomachs bloated from eating mud",
    "We boys of teeth porous from eating dates and pumpkin rind",
    "We boys will line up from Hassan al-Basri\u2019s mausoleum to the Ashar River\u2019s source",
    "to meet you in the morning waving green palm fronds",
    "We will cry out: Long Live",
    "We will cry out: Live to Eternity",
    "And we will hear the music of Scottish bagpipes, gladly",
    "Sometimes we will laugh at an Indian soldier\u2019s beard",
    "but fear will merge with our laughs, and dispute them",
    "We cry out: Long Live",
    "We cry out: Live to Eternity",
    "and reach our hands toward you: Give us bread",
    "We the hungry, starving since our birth in this village",
    "Give us meat, chewing gum, cans, and fish",
    "Give us, so no mother expels her child",
    "so that we do not eat mud and sleep",
    "We boys, the neighborhood\u2019s barefoot",
    "do not know from where you had come",
    "or why you had come",
    "or why we cry out: Long Live",
    "...............................",
    "And now we ask: will you stay long?",
    "And will we go on reaching our hands toward you?",
    "London, December 3, 2002"

    "I dreamed that I was old: in stale declension",
    "Fallen from my prime, when company",
    "Was mine, cat-nimbleness, and green invention,",
    "Before time took my leafy hours away.",
    "My wisdom, ripe with body\u2019s ruin, found",
    "Itself tart recompense for what was lost",
    "In false exchange: since wisdom in the ground",
    "Has no apocalypse or pentecost.",
    "I wept for my youth, sweet passionate young thought,",
    "And cozy women dead that by my side",
    "Once lay: I wept with bitter longing, not",
    "Remembering how in my youth I cried."

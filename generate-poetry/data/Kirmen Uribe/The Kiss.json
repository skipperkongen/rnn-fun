    "My breasts are small and my eyes round.",
    "Your legs long and cool as the freshet",
    "that runs down from the fountain.",
    "I bite your neck,",
    "it\u2019s sturdy, still not yet ripe,",
    "like a walnut that has just now fallen.",
    "You clamber on top, start kissing my middle,",
    "strew wet wavelets all over my skin,",
    "now up here, now down there,",
    "like the first fat drops to fall before",
    "the storm starts, splat, splat, splat.",
    "We\u2019ve gone to sleep back to chest,",
    "the way lips rejoin",
    "after sighing."

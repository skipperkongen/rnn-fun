    "Last night, when the moon",
    "slipped into my attic room",
    "as an oblong of light,",
    "I sensed she\u2019d come to commiserate.",
    "It was August. She traveled",
    "with a small valise",
    "of darkness, and the first few stars",
    "returning to the northern sky,",
    "and my room, it seemed,",
    "had missed her. She pretended",
    "an interest in the bookcase",
    "while other objects",
    "stirred, as in a rock pool,",
    "with unexpected life:",
    "strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,",
    "the paper-crowded desk;",
    "the books, too, appeared inclined",
    "to open and confess.",
    "Being sure the moon",
    "harbored some intention,",
    "I waited; watched for an age",
    "her cool gaze shift",
    "first toward a flower sketch",
    "pinned on the far wall",
    "then glide down to recline",
    "along the pinewood floor,",
    "before I\u2019d had enough.",
    ",",
    "I said,",
    "the simple words of love? Say them.",
    "You are not my mother;",
    "with my mother, I waited unto death."

    "This is the multitude, the beasts",
    "you wanted to show me, drawing me",
    "upstream, all morning up through wind-",
    "scoured heather to the hillcrest.",
    "Below us, in the next glen, is the grave",
    "calm brotherhood, descended",
    "out of winter, out of hunger, kneeling",
    "like the signatories of a covenant;",
    "their weighty, antique-polished antlers",
    "rising above the vegetation",
    "like masts in a harbor, or city spires.",
    "We lie close together, and though the wind",
    "whips away our man-and-woman smell, every",
    "stag-face seems to look toward us, toward,",
    "but not to us: we\u2019re held, and hold them,",
    "in civil regard. I suspect you\u2019d",
    "hoped to impress me, to lift to my sight",
    "our shared country, lead me deeper",
    "into what you know, but loath",
    "to cause fear you\u2019re already moving",
    "quietly away, sure I\u2019ll go with you,",
    "as I would now, almost anywhere."

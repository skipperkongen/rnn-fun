    "Time does not bring relief; you all have lied",
    "Who told me time would ease me of my pain!",
    "I miss him in the weeping of the rain;",
    "I want him at the shrinking of the tide;",
    "The old snows melt from every mountain-side,",
    "And last year\u2019s leaves are smoke in every lane;",
    "But last year\u2019s bitter loving must remain",
    "Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide.",
    "There are a hundred places where I fear",
    "To go,\u2014so with his memory they brim.",
    "And entering with relief some quiet place",
    "Where never fell his foot or shone his face",
    "I say, \u201cThere is no memory of him here!\u201d",
    "And so stand stricken, so remembering him."

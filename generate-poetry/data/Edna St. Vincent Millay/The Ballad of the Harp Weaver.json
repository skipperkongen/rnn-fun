    "\u201cSon,\u201d said my mother,",
    "When I was knee-high,",
    "\u201cYou\u2019ve need of clothes to cover you,",
    "And not a rag have I.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the house",
    "To make a boy breeches,",
    "Nor shears to cut a cloth with",
    "Nor thread to take stitches.",
    "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the house",
    "But a loaf-end of rye,",
    "And a harp with a woman\u2019s head",
    "Nobody will buy,\u201d",
    "And she began to cry.",
    "That was in the early fall.",
    "When came the late fall,",
    "\u201cSon,\u201d she said, \u201cthe sight of you",
    "Makes your mother\u2019s blood crawl,\u2013",
    "\u201cLittle skinny shoulder-blades",
    "Sticking through your clothes!",
    "And where you\u2019ll get a jacket from",
    "God above knows.",
    "\u201cIt\u2019s lucky for me, lad,",
    "Your daddy\u2019s in the ground,",
    "And can\u2019t see the way I let",
    "His son go around!\u201d",
    "And she made a queer sound.",
    "That was in the late fall.",
    "When the winter came,",
    "I\u2019d not a pair of breeches",
    "Nor a shirt to my name.",
    "I couldn\u2019t go to school,",
    "Or out of doors to play.",
    "And all the other little boys",
    "Passed our way.",
    "\u201cSon,\u201d said my mother,",
    "\u201dCome, climb into my lap,",
    "And I\u2019ll chafe your little bones",
    "While you take a nap.\u201d",
    "And, oh, but we were silly",
    "For half an hour or more,",
    "Me with my long legs",
    "Dragging on the floor,",
    "A-rock-rock-rocking",
    "To a mother-goose rhyme!",
    "Oh, but we were happy",
    "For half an hour\u2019s time!",
    "But there was I, a great boy,",
    "And what would folks say",
    "To hear my mother singing me",
    "To sleep all day,",
    "In such a daft way?",
    "Men say the winter",
    "Was bad that year;",
    "Fuel was scarce,",
    "And food was dear.",
    "A wind with a wolf\u2019s head",
    "Howled about our door,",
    "And we burned up the chairs",
    "And sat upon the floor.",
    "All that was left us",
    "Was a chair we couldn\u2019t break,",
    "And the harp with a woman\u2019s head",
    "Nobody would take,",
    "For song or pity\u2019s sake.",
    "The night before Christmas",
    "I cried with the cold,",
    "I cried myself to sleep",
    "Like a two-year-old.",
    "And in the deep night",
    "I felt my mother rise,",
    "And stare down upon me",
    "With love in her eyes.",
    "I saw my mother sitting",
    "On the one good chair,",
    "A light falling on her",
    "From I couldn\u2019t tell where,",
    "Looking nineteen,",
    "And not a day older,",
    "And the harp with a woman\u2019s head",
    "Leaned against her shoulder.",
    "Her thin fingers, moving",
    "In the thin, tall strings,",
    "Were weav-weav-weaving",
    "Wonderful things.",
    "Many bright threads,",
    "From where I couldn\u2019t see,",
    "Were running through the harp-strings",
    "Rapidly,",
    "And gold threads whistling",
    "Through my mother\u2019s hand.",
    "I saw the web grow,",
    "And the pattern expand.",
    "She wove a child\u2019s jacket,",
    "And when it was done",
    "She laid it on the floor",
    "And wove another one.",
    "She wove a red cloak",
    "So regal to see,",
    "\u201cShe\u2019s made it for a king\u2019s son,\u201d",
    "I said, \u201cand not for me.\u201d",
    "But I knew it was for me.",
    "She wove a pair of breeches",
    "Quicker than that!",
    "She wove a pair of boots",
    "And a little cocked hat.",
    "She wove a pair of mittens,",
    "She wove a little blouse,",
    "She wove all night",
    "In the still, cold house.",
    "She sang as she worked,",
    "And the harp-strings spoke;",
    "Her voice never faltered,",
    "And the thread never broke.",
    "And when I awoke,\u2013",
    "There sat my mother",
    "With the harp against her shoulder",
    "Looking nineteen",
    "And not a day older,",
    "A smile about her lips,",
    "And a light about her head,",
    "And her hands in the harp-strings",
    "Frozen dead.",
    "And piled up beside her",
    "And toppling to the skies,",
    "Were the clothes of a king\u2019s son,",
    "Just my size."

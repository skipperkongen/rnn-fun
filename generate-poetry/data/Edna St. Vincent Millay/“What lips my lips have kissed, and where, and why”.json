    "What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,",
    "I have forgotten, and what arms have lain",
    "Under my head till morning; but the rain",
    "Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh",
    "Upon the glass and listen for reply,",
    "And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain",
    "For unremembered lads that not again",
    "Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.",
    "Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,",
    "Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,",
    "Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:",
    "I cannot say what loves have come and gone,",
    "I only know that summer sang in me",
    "A little while, that in me sings no more."

    "We were very tired, we were very merry\u2014",
    "We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.",
    "It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable\u2014",
    "But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,",
    "We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;",
    "And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.",
    "We were very tired, we were very merry\u2014",
    "We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;",
    "And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,",
    "From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;",
    "And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,",
    "And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.",
    "We were very tired, we were very merry,",
    "We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.",
    "We hailed, \u201cGood morrow, mother!\u201d to a shawl-covered head,",
    "And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;",
    "And she wept, \u201cGod bless you!\u201d for the apples and pears,",
    "And we gave her all our money but our subway fares."

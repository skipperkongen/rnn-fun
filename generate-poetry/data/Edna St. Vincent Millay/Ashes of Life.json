    "Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;",
    "Eat I must, and sleep I will, \u0097 and would that night were here!",
    "But ah! \u0097 to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!",
    "Would that it were day again! \u0097 with twilight near!",
    "Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;",
    "This or that or what you will is all the same to me;",
    "But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, \u0097",
    "There's little use in anything as far as I can see.",
    "Love has gone and left me, \u0097 and the neighbors knock and borrow,",
    "And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, \u0097",
    "And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow",
    "There's this little street and this little house."

    "O world, I cannot hold thee close enough!",
    "Thy winds, thy wide grey skies!",
    "Thy mists, that roll and rise!",
    "Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sag",
    "And all but cry with colour! That gaunt crag",
    "To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff!",
    "World, World, I cannot get thee close enough!",
    "Long have I known a glory in it all,",
    "But never knew I this;",
    "Here such a passion is",
    "As stretcheth me apart,\u2014Lord, I do fear",
    "Thou\u2019st made the world too beautiful this year;",
    "My soul is all but out of me,\u2014let fall",
    "No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call."

    "Vainly my heart had with thy sorceries striven:",
    "It had no refuge from thy love,\u2014no Heaven",
    "But in thy fatal presence;\u2014from afar",
    "It owned thy power and trembled like a star",

    "How dark a shadow should obscure its beam?\u2014",
    "Could I believe that pain could ever dwell",

    "Thou wert my proud palladium;\u2014could I fear",
    "The avenging Destinies when thou wert near?\u2014",
    "wert my Destiny;\u2014thy song, thy fame,",
    "The wild enchantments clustering round thy name,",
    "Were my soul\u2019s heritage, its royal dower;",
    "Its glory and its kingdom and its power!"

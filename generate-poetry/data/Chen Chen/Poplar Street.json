    "Oh. Sorry. Hello. Are you on your way to work, too?",
    "I was just taken aback by how you also have a briefcase,",
    "also small & brown. I was taken by how you seem, secretly,",
    "to love everything. Are you my new coworker? Oh. I see. No.",
    "Still, good to meet you. I\u2019m trying out this thing where it\u2019s good",
    "to meet people. Maybe, beyond briefcases, we have some things",
    "in common. I like jelly beans. I\u2019m afraid of death. I\u2019m afraid",
    "of farting, even around people I love. Do you think your mother",
    "loves you when you fart? Does your mother love you",
    "all the time? Have you ever doubted?",
    "I like that the street we\u2019re on is named after a tree,",
    "when there are none, poplar or otherwise. I wonder if a tree",
    "has ever been named after a street, whether that worked out.",
    "If I were a street, I hope I\u2019d get a good name, not Main",
    "or One-Way. One night I ran out of an apartment,",
    "down North Pleasant Street \u2014 it was soft & neighborly",
    "with pines & oaks, it felt too hopeful,",
    "after what happened. After my mother\u2019s love",
    "became doubtful. After I told her I liked a boy & she wished",
    "I had never been born. After she said she was afraid",
    "of me, terrified I might infect my brothers",
    "with my abnormality. Sometimes, parents & children",
    "become the most common strangers. Eventually,",
    "a street appears where they can meet again.",
    "Or not. I\u2019ve doubted my own love for my mother. I doubt.",
    "Do I have to forgive in order to love? Or do I have to love",
    "for forgiveness to even be possible? What do you think?",
    "I\u2019m trying out this thing where questions about love & forgiveness",
    "are a form of work I\u2019d rather not do alone. I\u2019m trying to say,",
    "Let\u2019s put our briefcases on our heads, in the sudden rain,",
    "& continue meeting as if we\u2019ve just been given our names."

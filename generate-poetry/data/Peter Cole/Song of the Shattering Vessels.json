    "Either the world is coming together,",
    "or else the world is falling apart \u2014",
    "here \u2014 now \u2014 along these letters,",
    "against the walls of every heart.",
    "Today, tomorrow, within its weather,",
    "the end or beginning\u2019s about to start \u2014",
    "the world impossibly coming together",
    "or very possibly falling apart.",
    "Now the lovers\u2019 mouths are open \u2014",
    "maybe the miracle\u2019s about to start:",
    "the world within us coming together,",
    "because all around us it\u2019s falling apart.",
    "Even as they speak, he wonders,",
    "even as the fear departs:",
    "that the world coming together?",
    "Can they keep it from falling apart?",
    "The image, gradually, is growing sharper;",
    "now the sound is like a dart:",
    "It seemed their world was coming together,",
    "but in fact it was falling apart.",
    "That\u2019s the nightmare, that\u2019s the terror,",
    "that\u2019s the Isaac of this art \u2014",
    "which sees that the world might come together",
    "if only we\u2019re willing to take it apart.",
    "The dream, the lure, is the prayer\u2019s answer,",
    "which can\u2019t be plotted on any chart \u2014",
    "as we know the world that\u2019s coming together",
    "without our knowing is falling apart."

    "The door-latch is always stubborn",
    "beyond it dozes a beast",
    "tinged by the fire",
    "they know who is walking",
    "the curve of the road",
    "by their footsteps alone",
    "glance at the fancy lamp",
    "hanging from the sooty ceiling",
    "a green and speckled plant withers",
    "a child who has wandered cries",
    "beneath a long low sky",
    "and at last the snow comes on."

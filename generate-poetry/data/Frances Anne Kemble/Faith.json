    "Better trust all, and be deceived,",
    "And weep that trust, and that deceiving;",
    "Than doubt one heart, that, if believed,",
    "Had blessed one\u2019s life with true believing.",
    "Oh, in this mocking world, too fast",
    "The doubting fiend o\u2019ertakes our youth!",
    "Better be cheated to the last,",
    "Than lose the bless\u00e8d hope of truth."

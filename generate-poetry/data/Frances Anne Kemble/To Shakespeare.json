    "Oft, when my lips I open to rehearse",
    "Thy wondrous spell of wisdom, and of power,",
    "And that my voice, and thy immortal verse,",
    "On listening ears, and hearts, I mingled pour,",
    "I shrink dismayed \u2013 and awful doth appear",
    "The vain presumption of my own weak deed;",
    "Thy glorious spirit seems to mine so near,",
    "That suddenly I tremble as I read \u2013",
    "Thee an invisible auditor I fear:",
    "Oh, if it might be so, my master dear!",
    "With what beseeching would I pray to thee,",
    "To make me equal to my noble task,",
    "Succor from thee, how humbly would I ask,",
    "Thy worthiest works to utter worthily."

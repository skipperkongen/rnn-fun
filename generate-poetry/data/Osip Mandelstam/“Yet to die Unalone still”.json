    "Yet to die. Unalone still.",

    "Live quiet and consoled",
    "In gaudy poverty, in powerful destitution.",
    "Blessed are those days and nights.",
    "The work of this sweet voice is without sin.",
    "Misery is he whom, like a shadow,",
    "A dog\u2019s barking frightens, the wind cuts down.",
    "Poor is he who, half-alive himself",
    "Begs his shade for pittance."

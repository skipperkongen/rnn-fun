    "As it would for a prow, the basin parts with your foot.",
    "Never a marsh, of heron blue",
    "but the single red feather",
    "from the wing of some black bird, somewhere",
    "a planked path winds above water,",
    "the line of sky above this aching space.",
    "Movement against the surface",
    "is the page that accepts no ink.",
    "A line running even",
    "over the alternating depths, organisms, algae,",
    "a rotting leaf.",
    "Walk naked before me",
    "carrying a sheaf of sticks.",
    "It\u2019s the most honest thing a man can do.",
    "As water would to accept you,",
    "I part",
    "a mouth, a marsh, or margin",
    "is of containment,",
    "the inside circuitous edge.",
    "No line to follow out to ocean,",
    "no river against an envelope",
    "of trembling white ships.",
    "Here I am landlock.",
    "Give me your hand."

    "A faint smell of urine",
    "embroidering that bouquet of mold the big cushions",
    "give off days the fog won\u2019t lift,",
    "and a shelf of bone",
    "growing out over the eyelids like evening\u2019s shadow",
    "across a field of corn\u2014",
    "The whole parade",
    "leaking out from your shoulders, bequeathing",
    "to the groin a pang of distance;",
    "then that metallic taste in the mouth",
    "and a voice you had let yourself believe",
    "was dead",
    "close now by your ear, intimate and sweet:",
    "look what we have here."

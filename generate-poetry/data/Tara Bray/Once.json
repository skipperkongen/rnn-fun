    "I climbed the roll of hay to watch the heron",
    "in the pond. He waded a few steps out,",
    "then back, thrusting his beak under water,",
    "pulling it up empty, but only once.",
    "Later I walked the roads for miles, certain",
    "he\u2019d be there when I returned. How is it for him,",
    "day after day, his brittle legs rising",
    "from warm green scum, his graceful neck curled,",
    "damp in the bright heat? It\u2019s a dull world.",
    "Every day, the same roads, the sky,",
    "the dust, the barn caving into itself,",
    "the tin roof twisted and scattered in the yard.",
    "Again, the bank covered with oxeye daisy",
    "that turns to spiderwort, to chicory,",
    "and at last to goldenrod. Each year, the birds\u2014",
    "thick in the air and darting in wild numbers\u2014",
    "grow quiet, the grasses thin, the light leaves",
    "earlier each day. The heron stood",
    "stone-still on my spot when I returned.",
    "And then, his wings burst open, lifting the steel-",
    "blue rhythm of his body into flight.",
    "I touched the warm hay. Hoping for a trace",
    "of his wild smell, I cupped my hands over",
    "my face: nothing but the heat of fields",
    "and skin. It wasn\u2019t long before the world",
    "began to breathe the beat of ordinary hours,",
    "stretching out again beneath the sky."

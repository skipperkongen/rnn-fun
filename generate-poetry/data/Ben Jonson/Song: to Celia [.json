    "Fame and rumor are but toys.",
    "Cannot we delude the eyes",
    "Of a few poor household spies,",
    "Or his easier ears beguile,",
    "So remov\u00e8d by our wile?",
    "\u2019Tis no sin love\u2019s fruit to steal;",
    "But the sweet thefts to reveal,",
    "To be taken, to be seen,",
    "These have crimes accounted been."

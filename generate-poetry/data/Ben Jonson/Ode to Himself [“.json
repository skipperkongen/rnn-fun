    "Come leave the loath\u00e9d stage,",
    "And the more loathsome age,",
    "Where pride and impudence in faction knit",
    "Usurp the chair of wit,",
    "Indicting and arraigning, every day,",
    "Something they call a play.",
    "Let their fastidious, vain",
    "Commission of the brain",
    "Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condemn:",
    "They were not made for thee, less thou for them.",
    "Say that thou pour\u2019st \u2019em wheat,",
    "And they would acorns eat;",
    "\u2018Twere simple fury, still thyself to waste",
    "On such as have no taste;",
    "To offer them a surfeit of pure bread,",
    "Whose appetites are dead;",
    "No, give them grains their fill,",
    "Husks, draff to drink, and swill;",
    "If they love lees, and leave the lusty wine,",
    "Envy them not, their palate\u2019s with the swine.",
    "No doubt a moldy tale,",
    "Like",
    ", and stale",
    "As the shrive\u2019s crusts, and nasty as his fish,",
    "Scraps out of every dish",
    "Thrown forth, and raked into the common tub,",
    "May keep up the Play Club.",
    "Broome\u2019s sweepings do as well",
    "There as his master\u2019s meal;",
    "For who the relish of these guests will fit",
    "Needs set them but the alms-basket of wit.",
    "And much good do\u2019t ye then,",
    "Brave plush and velvet men",
    "Can feed on orts, and safe in your scene clothes,",
    "Dare quit upon your oaths",
    "The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peers)",
    "Of stuffing your large ears",
    "With rage of comic socks,",
    "Wrought upon twenty blocks;",
    "Which, if they\u2019re torn, and foul, and patched enough,",
    "The gamesters share your guilt, and you their stuff.",
    "Leave things so prostitute,",
    "And take th\u2019Alcaic lute;",
    "Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon\u2019s lyre;",
    "Warm thee by Pindar\u2019s fire;",
    "And though thy nerves be shrunk, and blood be cold,",
    "Ere years have made thee old,",
    "Strike that disdainful heat",
    "Throughout, to their defeat;",
    "As curious fools, and envious of thy stain,",
    "May, blushing, swear no palsy\u2019s in thy brain.",
    "But when they hear thee sing",
    "The glories of thy King,",
    "His zeal to God, and his just awe of men,",
    "They may be blood-shaken, then",
    "Feel such a flesh-quake to possess their powers,",
    "That no tuned harp like ours,",
    "In sound of peace or wars,",
    "Shall truly hit the stars",
    "When they shall read the acts of Charles his reign,",
    "And see his chariot triumph \u2019bove his wain."

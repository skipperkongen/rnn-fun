    "That neither fame nor love might wanting be",
    "To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee;",
    "Whose house, if it no other honor had,",
    "In only thee might be both great and glad;",
    "Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time,",
    "Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime;",
    "Which deed I know not, whether were more high,",
    "Or thou more happy, it to justify",
    "Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day,",
    "Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray.",
    "Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won,",
    "To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run.",
    "Love honors, which of best example be",
    "When they cost dearest and are done most free;",
    "Though every fortitude deserves applause,",
    "It may be much or little in the cause.",
    "He\u2019s valiant\u2019st that dares fight, and not for pay;",
    "That virtuous is, when the reward\u2019s away."

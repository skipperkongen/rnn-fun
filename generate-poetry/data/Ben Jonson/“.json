    "Though I am young, and cannot tell",
    "Either what Death or Love is well,",
    "Yet I have heard they both bear darts,",
    "And both do aim at human hearts.",
    "And then again, I have been told",
    "Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;",
    "So that I fear they do but bring",
    "Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.",
    "As in a ruin we it call",
    "One thing to be blown up, or fall;",
    "Or to our end like way may have",
    "By a flash of lightning, or a wave;",
    "So Love\u2019s inflam\u00e8d shaft or brand",
    "May kill as soon as Death\u2019s cold hand;",
    "Except Love\u2019s fires the virtue have",
    "To fright the frost out of the grave."

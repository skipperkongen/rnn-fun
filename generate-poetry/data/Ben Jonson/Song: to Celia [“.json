    "Drink to me only with thine eyes,",
    "And I will pledge with mine;",
    "Or leave a kiss but in the cup,",
    "And I\u2019ll not look for wine.",
    "The thirst that from the soul doth rise",
    "Doth ask a drink divine;",
    "But might I of Jove\u2019s nectar sup,",
    "I would not change for thine.",
    "I sent thee late a rosy wreath,",
    "Not so much honouring thee",
    "As giving it a hope, that there",
    "It could not withered be.",
    "But thou thereon didst only breathe,",
    "And sent\u2019st it back to me;",
    "Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,",
    "Not of itself, but thee."

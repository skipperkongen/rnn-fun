    "Here lies, to each her parents\u2019 ruth,",
    "Mary, the daughter of their youth;",
    "Yet all heaven\u2019s gifts being heaven\u2019s due,",
    "It makes the father less to rue.",
    "At six months\u2019 end she parted hence",
    "With safety of her innocence;",
    "Whose soul heaven\u2019s queen, whose name she bears,",
    "In comfort of her mother\u2019s tears,",
    "Hath placed amongst her virgin-train:",
    "Where, while that severed doth remain,",
    "This grave partakes the fleshly birth;",
    "Which cover lightly, gentle earth!"

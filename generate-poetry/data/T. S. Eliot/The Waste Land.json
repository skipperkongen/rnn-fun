    "A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,",
    "And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,",
    "And the dry stone no sound of water. Only",
    "There is shadow under this red rock,",
    "(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),",
    "And I will show you something different from either",
    "Your shadow at morning striding behind you",
    "Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;",

    "As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene",
    "The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king",
    "So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale",
    "Filled all the desert with inviolable voice",
    "And still she cried, and still the world pursues,",
    "\u201cJug Jug\u201d to dirty ears.",
    "And other withered stumps of time",
    "Were told upon the walls; staring forms",
    "Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.",
    "Footsteps shuffled on the stair.",
    "Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair",
    "Spread out in fiery points",

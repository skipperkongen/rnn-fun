    "The white chocolate jar full of petals",
    "swills odds and ends around in a dizzying eye",
    "of four o\u2019clocks now and to come. The tiger,",
    "marvellously striped and irritable, leaps",
    "on the table and without disturbing a hair",
    "of the flowers\u2019 breathless attention, pisses",
    "into the pot, right down its delicate spout.",
    "A whisper of steam goes up from that porcelain",
    "urethra. \u201cSaint-Sa\u00ebns!\u201d it seems to be whispering,",
    "curling unerringly around the furry nuts",
    "of the terrible puss, who is mentally flexing.",
    "Ah be with me always, spirit of noisy",
    "contemplation in the studio, the Garden",
    "of Zoos, the eternally fixed afternoons!",
    "There, while music scratches its scrofulous",
    "stomach, the brute beast emerges and stands,",
    "clear and careful, knowing always the exact peril",
    "at this moment caressing his fangs with",
    "a tongue given wholly to luxurious usages;",
    "which only a moment before dropped aspirin",
    "in this sunset of roses, and now throws a chair",
    "in the air to aggravate the truly menacing."

    "Krushchev is coming on the right day!",
    "the cool graced light",
    "is pushed off the enormous glass piers by hard wind",
    "and everything is tossing, hurrying on up",
    "this country",
    "has everything but",
    ", a Puerto Rican cab driver says",
    "and five different girls I see",
    "look like Piedie Gimbel",
    "with her blonde hair tossing too,",
    "as she looked when I pushed",
    "her little daughter on the swing on the lawn it was also windy",
    "last night we went to a movie and came out,",
    "Ionesco is greater",
    "than Beckett, Vincent said, that's what I think, blueberry blintzes",
    "and Khrushcev was probably being carped at",
    "in Washington, no",
    "Vincent tells me about his mother's trip to Sweden",
    "Hans tells us",
    "about his father's life in Sweden, it sounds like Grace Hartigan's",
    "painting",
    "so I go home to bed and names drift through my",
    "head",
    "Purgatorio Merchado, Gerhard Schwartz and Gaspar Gonzales,",
    "all unknown figures of the early morning as I go to work",
    "where does the evil of the year go",
    "when September takes New York",
    "and turns it into ozone stalagmites",
    "deposits of light",
    "so I get back up",
    "make coffee, and read Fran\u00e7ois Villon, his life, so dark",
    "New York seems blinding and my tie is blowing up the street",
    "I wish it would blow off",
    "though it is cold and somewhat warms",
    "my neck",
    "as the train bears Krushchev on to Pennsylvania Station",
    "and the light seems to be eternal",
    "and joy seems to be inexorable",
    "I am foolish enough always to find it in wind"

    "Mothers of America",
    "let your kids go to the movies!",
    "get them out of the house so they won\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to",
    "it\u2019s true that fresh air is good for the body",
    "but what about the soul",
    "that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images",
    "and when you grow old as grow old you must",
    "they won\u2019t hate you",
    "they won\u2019t criticize you they won\u2019t know",
    "they\u2019ll be in some glamorous country",
    "they first saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey",
    "they may even be grateful to you",
    "for their first sexual experience",
    "which only cost you a quarter",
    "and didn\u2019t upset the peaceful home",
    "they will know where candy bars come from",
    "and gratuitous bags of popcorn",
    "as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it\u2019s over",
    "with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg",
    "near the Williamsburg Bridge",
    "oh mothers you will have made the little tykes",
    "so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies",
    "they won\u2019t know the difference",
    "and if somebody does it\u2019ll be sheer gravy",
    "and they\u2019ll have been truly entertained either way",
    "instead of hanging around the yard",
    "or up in their room",
    "hating you",
    "prematurely since you won\u2019t have done anything horribly mean yet",
    "except keeping them from the darker joys",
    "it\u2019s unforgivable the latter",
    "so don\u2019t blame me if you won\u2019t take this advice",
    "and the family breaks up",
    "and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV set",
    "seeing",
    "movies you wouldn\u2019t let them see when they were young"

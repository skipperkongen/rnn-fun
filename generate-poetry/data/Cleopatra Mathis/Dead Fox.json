    "We pretended to know nothing about it.",
    "I withdrew to childhood training: stay out",
    "of swampy undergrowth, choked edges.",
    "This was around the time",
    "we were too cruel to kill the mice we caught,",
    "leaving them in the Have-a-Heart trap",
    "under the sun-burning bramble of rugosa.",
    "But moving up the trail, we caught a glimpse",
    "right at the start: the fox just over the hillock",
    "on the dune-side slope, spoiling",
    "the grass-inscribed sand. Neither of us looked\u2014",
    "it seemed best to back away.",
    "On the dune\u2019s steep side",
    "we surveyed what we\u2019d come for: ocean\u2019s",
    "snaking blues beyond the meadow, the silvered",
    "blade-like wands lying down. Lovely enough",
    "to hold ourselves to that view.",
    "But the currents of an odor wafted in and out,",
    "until the sweep of smell grew wider, wilder.",
    "The heat compounded, and ugliness",
    "settled its cloud over us, profound as human speech,",
    "although by then we were not speaking."

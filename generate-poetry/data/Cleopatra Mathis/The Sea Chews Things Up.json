    "When I woke, the waves had gone black,",
    "turning over the macerated",
    "curd of the ocean bottom, heaving its sludge",
    "onto the beach. Some storm far out, I thought,",
    "had ravaged the sea, stirred up its bed,",
    "sent the whole mess flying to shore.",
    "At my feet I found a grave of starfish,",
    "broken and gnarled among the fleshy",
    "snipes and heads. Every shade of death",
    "covered the sand. It looked hopeless",
    "in the pale day but for the birds,",
    "a congress of gulls, terns, and the rarest plovers,",
    "calm for once, satiated, a measure of",
    "the one law: this sea will claim it all\u2014",
    "feed them, catch them, grind their complicated bones."

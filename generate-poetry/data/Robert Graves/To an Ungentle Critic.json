    "But what\u2019s the use of setting down",
    "That glorious blaze behind the town?",

    "For newer pictures in this book;",

    "But what reads new or curious there",
    "When cold winds fly across the air?",
    "You\u2019ll only frown; you\u2019ll turn the page,",
    "But find no glimpse of your \u2018New Age",
    "Of Poetry\u2019 in my worn-out words.",
    "Must winds that cut like blades of steel",
    "And sunsets swimming in Volnay,",
    "The holiest, cruellest pains I feel,",
    "Die stillborn, because old men squeal",

    "And twelve more like \u2019em yesterday\u2019?",
    "No, no! my chicken, I shall scrawl",
    "Just what I fancy as I strike it,",
    "Fairies and Fusiliers, and all.",
    "Old broken knock-kneed thought will crawl",
    "Across my verse in the classic way.",
    "And, sir, be careful what you say;",
    "There are old-fashioned folk still like it."

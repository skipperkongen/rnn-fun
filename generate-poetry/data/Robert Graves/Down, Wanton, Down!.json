    "Down, wanton, down! Have you no shame",

    "Indifferent what you storm or why,",
    "So be that in the breach you die!",
    "Love may be blind, but Love at least",
    "Knows what is man and what mere beast;",
    "Or Beauty wayward, but requires",
    "More delicacy from her squires.",
    "Tell me, my witless, whose one boast",
    "Could be your staunchness at the post,",
    "When were you made a man of parts",
    "To think fine and profess the arts?",
    "Will many-gifted Beauty come",
    "Bowing to your bald rule of thumb,",
    "Or Love swear loyalty to your crown?",
    "Be gone, have done! Down, wanton, down!"

    "The whole field was so smelly;",
    "We smelt the poor dog first:",
    "His horrid swollen belly",
    "Looked just like going burst.",
    "His fur was most untidy;",
    "He hadn\u2019t any eyes.",
    "It happened on Good Friday",
    "And there was lots of flies.",
    "And then I felt the coldest",
    "I\u2019d ever felt, and sick,",
    "But Rose, \u2019cause she\u2019s the oldest,",
    "Dared poke him with her stick.",
    "He felt quite soft and horrid:",
    "The flies buzzed round his head",
    "And settled on his forehead:",
    "Rose whispered: \u2018That dog\u2019s dead.",
    "\u2018You bury all dead people,",
    "When they\u2019re quite really dead,",
    "Round churches with a steeple:",
    "Let\u2019s bury this,\u2019 Rose said.",
    "\u2018And let\u2019s put mint all round it",
    "To hide the nasty smell.\u2019",
    "I went to look and found it\u2014",
    "Lots, growing near the well.",
    "We poked him through the clover",
    "Into a hole, and then",
    "We threw brown earth right over",
    "And said: \u2018Poor dog, Amen!\u2019"

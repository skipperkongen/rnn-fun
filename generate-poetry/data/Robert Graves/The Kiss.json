    "Are you shaken, are you stirred",
    "By a whisper of love,",
    "Spellbound to a word",
    "Does Time cease to move,",
    "Till her calm grey eye",
    "Expands to a sky",
    "And the clouds of her hair",
    "Like storms go by?",
    "Then the lips that you have kissed",
    "Turn to frost and fire,",
    "And a white-steaming mist",
    "Obscures desire:",
    "So back to their birth",
    "Fade water, air, earth,",
    "And the First Power moves",
    "Over void and dearth.",
    "Is that Love? no, but Death,",
    "A passion, a shout,",
    "The deep in-breath,",
    "The breath roaring out,",
    "And once that is flown,",
    "You must lie alone,",
    "Without hope, without life,",
    "Poor flesh, sad bone."

    "Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short;",
    "And done, we straight repent us of the sport:",
    "Let us not then rush blindly on unto it,",
    "Like lustful beasts, that only know to do it:",
    "For lust will languish, and that heat decay.",
    "But thus, thus, keeping endless holiday,",
    "Let us together closely lie and kiss,",
    "There is no labour, nor no shame in this;",
    "This hath pleased, doth please, and long will please; never",
    "Can this decay, but is beginning ever."

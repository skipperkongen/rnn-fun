    "We are the music-makers,",
    "And we are the dreamers of dreams,",

    "On whom the pale moon gleams:",
    "Yet we are the movers and shakers",
    "Of the world for ever, it seems.",
    "With wonderful deathless ditties",
    "We build up the world\u2019s great cities.",
    "And out of a fabulous story",
    "We fashion an empire\u2019s glory:",
    "One man with a dream, at pleasure,",
    "Shall go forth and conquer a crown;",
    "And three with a new song\u2019s measure",
    "Can trample an empire down.",
    "We, in the ages lying",
    "In the buried past of the earth,",
    "Built Nineveh with our sighing,",
    "And Babel itself with our mirth;",
    "And o\u2019erthrew them with prophesying",
    "To the old of the new world\u2019s worth;",
    "For each age is a dream that is dying,",
    "Or one that is coming to birth.",

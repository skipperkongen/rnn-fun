    "I returned to a stand of pines,",
    "bone-thin phalanx",
    "flanking the roadside, tangle",
    "of understory\u2014a dialectic of dark",
    "and light\u2014and magnolias blossoming",
    "like afterthought: each flower",
    "a surrender, white flags draped",
    "among the branches. I returned",
    "to land\u2019s end, the swath of coast",
    "clear cut and buried in sand:",
    "mangrove, live oak, gulfweed",
    "razed and replaced by thin palms\u2014",
    "palmettos\u2014symbols of victory",
    "or defiance, over and over",
    "marking this vanquished land. I returned",
    "to a field of cotton, hallowed ground\u2014",
    "as slave legend goes\u2014each boll",
    "holding the ghosts of generations:",
    "those who measured their days",
    "by the heft of sacks and lengths",
    "of rows, whose sweat flecked the cotton plants",
    "still sewn into our clothes.",
    "I returned to a country battlefield",
    "where colored troops fought and died\u2014",
    "Port Hudson where their bodies swelled",
    "and blackened beneath the sun\u2014unburied",
    "until earth\u2019s green sheet pulled over them,",
    "unmarked by any headstones.",
    "Where the roads, buildings, and monuments",
    "are named to honor the Confederacy,",
    "where that old flag still hangs, I return",
    "to Mississippi, state that made a crime",
    "of me\u2014mulatto, half-breed\u2014native",
    "in my native land, this place they\u2019ll bury me."

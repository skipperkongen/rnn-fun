    "We leave Gulfport at noon; gulls overhead",

    "first is the fort, its roof of grass, a lee\u2014",
    "half reminder of the men who served there\u2014",
    "a weathered monument to some of the dead.",
    "Inside we follow the ranger, hurried",
    "though we are to get to the beach. He tells",
    "of graves lost in the Gulf, the island split",
    "in half when Hurricane Camille hit,",

    "What is monument to their legacy?",
    "All the grave markers, all the crude headstones\u2014",
    "water-lost. Now fish dart among their bones,",
    "and we listen for what the waves intone.",
    "Only the fort remains, near forty feet high,",
    "round, unfinished, half open to the sky,",
    "the elements\u2014wind, rain\u2014God\u2019s deliberate eye."

    "Force of reason, who shut up the shrill",
    "foul Furies in the dungeon of the Parthenon,",
    "led whimpering to the cave they live in still,",
    "beneath the rock your city foundered on:",
    "who, equivocating, taught revenge to sing",
    "(or seem to, or be about to) a kindlier tune:",
    "mind that can make a scheme of anything\u2014",
    "a game, a grid, a system, a mere folder",
    "in the universal file drawer: uncompromising",
    "mediatrix, virgin married to the welfare",
    "of the body politic: deific contradiction,",
    "warbonnet-wearing olive-bearer, author",
    "of the law\u2019s delays, you who as talisman",
    "and totem still wear the aegis, baleful",
    "with Medusa\u2019s scowl (though shrunken",
    "and self-mummified, a Gorgon still): cool",
    "guarantor of the averted look, the guide",
    "of Perseus, who killed and could not kill",
    "the thing he\u2019d hounded to its source, the dread",
    "thing-in-itself none can elude, whose counter-",
    "feit we halfway hanker for: aware (gone mad",
    "with clarity) we have invented all you stand for,",
    "though we despise the artifice\u2014a space to savor",
    "horror, to pre-enact our own undoing in\u2014",
    "living, we stare into the mirror of the Gorgon."

    "Frame within frame, the evolving conversation",
    "is dancelike, as though two could play",
    "at improvising snowflakes\u2019",
    "six-feather-vaned evanescence,",
    "no two ever alike. All process",
    "and no arrival: the happier we are,",
    "the less there is for memory to take hold of,",
    "or\u2014memory being so largely a predilection",
    "for the exceptional\u2014come to a halt",
    "in front of. But finding, one evening",
    "on a street not quite familiar,",
    "inside a gated",
    "November-sodden garden, a building",
    "of uncertain provenance,",
    "peering into whose vestibule we were",
    "arrested\u2014a frame within a frame,",
    "a lozenge of impeccable clarity\u2014",
    "by the reflection, no, not",
    "of our two selves, but of",
    "dancers exercising in a mirror,",
    "at the center",
    "of that clarity, what we saw",
    "was not stillness",
    "but movement: the perfection",
    "of memory consisting, it would seem,",
    "in the never-to-be-completed.",
    "We saw them mirroring themselves,",
    "never guessing the vestibule",
    "that defined them, frame within frame,",
    "contained two other mirrors."

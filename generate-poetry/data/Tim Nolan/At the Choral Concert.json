    "The high school kids are so beautiful",
    "in their lavender blouses and crisp white shirts.",
    "They open their mouths to sing with that",
    "far-off stare they had looking out from the crib.",
    "Their voices lift up from the marble bed",
    "of the high altar to the blue endless ceiling",
    "of heaven as depicted in the cloudy dome\u2014",
    "and we\u2014as the parents\u2014crane our necks",
    "to see our children and what is above us\u2014",
    "and ahead of us\u2014until the end when we",
    "are invited up to sing with them\u2014sopranos",
    "and altos\u2014tenors and basses\u2014to sing the great",
    "\u2014and I\u2019m standing with the other",
    "stunned and gray fathers\u2014holding our sheet music\u2014",
    "searching for our parts\u2014and we realize\u2014",
    "our voices are surprisingly rich\u2014experienced\u2014",
    "\u2014",
    "and how do we all know to come in",
    "at exactly the right moment?\u2014",
    "\u2014",
    "and how can it not seem that we shall reign",
    "\u2014in one voice with our beautiful",
    "children\u2014looking out into all those lights."

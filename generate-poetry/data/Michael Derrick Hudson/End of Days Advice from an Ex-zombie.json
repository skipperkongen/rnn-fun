    "To think I used to be so good at going to pieces",
    "gobbling my way through the cops",
    "and spooking what\u2019s left of the girls. How\u2019d I",
    "get so far, sloughing off one knuckle at a time,",
    "jerking my mossy pelt along",
    "ruined streets? Those insistent, dreadful thuds",
    "when we stacked our futile selves",
    "against locked doors. Our mumbles and groans!",
    "Such hungry nights! Staggering through the grit",
    "of looted malls, plastered with tattered",
    "flags of useless currency, I\u2019d slobbered all over",
    "the busted glass and merchandise of America ...",
    "But first you\u2019ll have to figure out those qualities",
    "separating what\u2019s being alive from",
    "who\u2019s already dead. Most of you will flunk that.",
    "Next learn how to want one thing over and over,",
    "night after night. Most of you",
    "are good at that. Don\u2019t get tired. Don\u2019t cough",
    "into your leftovers. Don\u2019t think. Always stand",
    "by your hobgoblin buddies. Clutch",
    "at whatever\u2019s there. Learn to sniff out sundowns."

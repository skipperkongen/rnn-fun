    "And does the heart grow old? You know",
    "In the indiscriminate green",
    "Of summer or in earliest snow",
    "A landscape is another scene,",
    "Inchoate and anonymous,",
    "And every rock and bush and drift",
    "As our affections alter us",
    "Will alter with the season\u2019s shift.",
    "So love by love we come at last,",
    "As through the exclusions of a rhyme,",
    "Or the exactions of a past,",
    "To the simplicity of time,",
    "The antiquity of grace, where yet",
    "We live in terror and delight",
    "With love as quiet as regret",
    "And love like anger in the night."

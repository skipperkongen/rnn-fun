    "I am no shepherd of a child\u2019s surmises.",
    "I have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises,",
    "Thirst where the grasses burn in early May",
    "And thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay.",
    "There is dust in this air. I saw in the heat",
    "Grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat.",
    "So to this hour. Through the warm dusk I drove",
    "To blizzards sifting on the hissing stove,",
    "And found no images of pastoral will,",
    "But fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill."

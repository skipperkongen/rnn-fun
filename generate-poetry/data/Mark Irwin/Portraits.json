    "Mother came to visit today. We",
    "hadn\u2019t seen each other in years. Why didn\u2019t",
    "you call? I asked. Your windows are filthy, she said. I know,",
    "I know. It\u2019s from the dust and rain. She stood outside.",
    "I stood in, and we cleaned each one that way, staring into each other\u2019s eyes,",
    "rubbing the white towel over our faces, rubbing",
    "away hours, years. This is what it was like",
    "when you were inside me, she said. What? I asked,",
    "though I understood. Afterwards, indoors, she smelled like snow",
    "melting. Holding hands we stood by the picture window,",
    "gazing into the December sun, watching the pines in flame."

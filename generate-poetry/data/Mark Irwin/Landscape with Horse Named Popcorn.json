    "The hummingbird hovers over bougainvillea, darting in and out",
    "of blossoms as the bride throws",
    "her corset among laughter and waving hands. Seeing you, glass in hand, sunlight",
    "piercing the punch bowl\u2019s crystal, I remember",
    "the horse, an Appaloosa, the white and gray markings",
    "like clouds, cumulus, one",
    "later on his grave, the 2X4 cross with name",
    "above a swell of land that could bring",
    "a man to his knees,",
    "or make him look up at fumbling shapes, cotton-fumed",
    "and slow. I can hear the screeching",
    "still.",
    "shook it in his mouth as we ran",
    "reaching toward black feathers\u2014then the \ufb01ne",
    "spray of blood\u2014until beyond adrenaline we began laughing,",
    "as laughing now, brushing confetti away, you hand",
    "the bride flowers, narcissi, their green throats pushing up",
    "from wet stones in a jar."

    "Naked for twenty-four of our last thirty-six",
    "Hours together, and I mean museum-quality, sex-",
    "Shop, God-riddling naked, sapping gold",
    "Light from the windows of her hundred-year-old",
    "Baltimore dorm, we were hungry for selling",
    "Points, like a couple in a showroom. Compelling",
    "Arguments were made to close the deal",
    "And children were discussed. I kissed her from heel",
    "To head in a shower without water;",
    "Then with. Nude, she read me a letter as a waiter",
    "Would his specials, and I couldn't keep",
    "My eyes off: smooth shoulders, belly, pelvis,",
    "Deep olive skin all a balm against sleep.",
    "It was from her sexy grandmother in Dieppe",
    "And S\u00e9verine translated, both of us",
    "Somehow drawn to this third party in a tidal",
    "Sort of way, her lunar candor, her antipodal",
    "Ease with words and the world. We were difficult,",
    "S\u00e9verine and I, a beautiful strain, a cult",
    "Of two. Even eating, we made lots of noise.",
    "Even resting in bed, watching the trees,",
    "Our lighter breathing, our limb-shifting, sheet-",
    "Rustling, even our dreaming had fight.",
    "Her heart was exceptionally loud\u2014not with love,",
    "But with knowing. Knowing what to be afraid of."

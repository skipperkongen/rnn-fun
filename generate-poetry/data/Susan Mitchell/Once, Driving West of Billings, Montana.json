    "I ran into the afterlife.",
    "No fluffy white clouds. Not even stars. Only sky",
    "dark as the inside of a movie theater",
    "at three in the afternoon and getting bigger all the time,",
    "expanding at terrific speed",
    "over the car which was disappearing,",
    "flattening out empty",
    "as the fields on either side.",
    "It was impossible to think",
    "under that rain louder than engines.",
    "I turned off the radio to listen, let my head",
    "fill up until every bone",
    "was vibrating\u2014sky.",
    "Twice, trees of lightning",
    "broke out of the asphalt. I could smell",
    "the highway burning. Long after, saw blue smoke twirling",
    "behind the eyeballs, lariats",
    "doing fancy rope tricks, jerking silver",
    "dollars out of the air, along with billiard cues, ninepins.",
    "I was starting to feel I could drive forever",
    "when suddenly one of those trees was right in front of me.",
    "Of course, I hit it\u2014",
    "branches shooting stars down the windshield,",
    "poor car shaking like a dazed cow.",
    "I thought this time for sure I was dead",
    "so whatever was on the other side had to be eternity.",
    "Saw sky enormous as nowhere. Kept on driving."

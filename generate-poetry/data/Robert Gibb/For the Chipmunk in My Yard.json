    "I think he knows I\u2019m alive, having come down",
    "The three steps of the back porch",
    "And given me a good once over. All afternoon",
    "He\u2019s been moving back and forth,",
    "Gathering odd bits of walnut shells and twigs,",
    "While all about him the great fields tumble",
    "To the blades of the thresher. He\u2019s lucky",
    "To be where he is, wild with all that happens.",
    "He\u2019s lucky he\u2019s not one of the shadows",
    "Living in the blond heart of the wheat.",
    "This autumn when trees bolt, dark with the fires",
    "Of starlight, he\u2019ll curl among their roots,",
    "Wanting nothing but the slow burn of matter",
    "On which he fastens like a small, brown flame."

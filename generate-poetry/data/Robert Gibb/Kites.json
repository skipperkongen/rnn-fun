    "Come March we\u2019d find them",
    "In the five-and-dimes,",
    "Furled tighter than umbrellas",
    "About their slats, the air",
    "In an undertow above us",
    "Like weather on the maps.",
    "We\u2019d play out lines",
    "Of kite string, tugging against",
    "The bucking sideways flights.",
    "Readied for assembly,",
    "I\u2019d arc the tensed keel of balsa",
    "Into place against the crosspiece,",
    "Feeling the paper snap",
    "Tautly as a sheet, then lift",
    "The almost weightless body",
    "Up to where it hauled me",
    "Trolling into the winds\u2014",
    "Knotted bows like vertebrae",
    "Flashing among fields",
    "Of light. Why ruin it",
    "By recalling the aftermaths?",
    "Kites gone down in tatters,",
    "Kites fraying like flotsam",
    "From the tops of the trees."

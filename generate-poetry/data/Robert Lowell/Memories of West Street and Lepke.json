    "Only teaching on Tuesdays, book-worming",
    "in pajamas fresh from the washer each morning,",
    "I hog a whole house on Boston\u2019s",
    "\u201chardly passionate Marlborough Street,\u201d",
    "where even the man",
    "scavenging filth in the back alley trash cans,",
    "has two children, a beach wagon, a helpmate,",
    "and is a \u201cyoung Republican.\u201d",
    "I have a nine months\u2019 daughter,",
    "young enough to be my granddaughter.",
    "Like the sun she rises in her flame-flamingo infants\u2019 wear.",
    "These are the tranquillized",
    "and I am forty. Ought I to regret my seedtime?",
    "I was a fire-breathing Catholic C.O.,",
    "and made my manic statement,",
    "telling off the state and president, and then",
    "sat waiting sentence in the bull pen",
    "beside a Negro boy with curlicues",
    "of marijuana in his hair.",
    "Given a year,",
    "I walked on the roof of the West Street Jail, a short",
    "enclosure like my school soccer court,",
    "and saw the Hudson River once a day",
    "through sooty clothesline entanglements",
    "and bleaching khaki tenements.",
    "Strolling, I yammered metaphysics with Abramowitz,",
    "a jaundice-yellow (\u201cit\u2019s really tan\u201d)",
    "and fly-weight pacifist,",
    "so vegetarian,",
    "he wore rope shoes and preferred fallen fruit.",
    "He tried to convert Bioff and Brown,",
    "the Hollywood pimps, to his diet.",
    "Hairy, muscular, suburban,",
    "wearing chocolate double-breasted suits,",
    "they blew their tops and beat him black and blue.",
    "I was so out of things, I\u2019d never heard",
    "of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.",
    "\u201cAre you a C.O.?\u201d I asked a fellow jailbird.",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, \u201cI\u2019m a J.W.\u201d",
    "He taught me the \u201chospital tuck,\u201d",
    "and pointed out the T-shirted back",
    "of",
    "Czar Lepke,",
    "there piling towels on a rack,",
    "or dawdling off to his little segregated cell full",
    "of things forbidden the common man:",
    "a portable radio, a dresser, two toy American",
    "flags tied together with a ribbon of Easter palm.",
    "Flabby, bald, lobotomized,",
    "he drifted in a sheepish calm,",
    "where no agonizing reappraisal",
    "jarred his concentration on the electric chair\u2014",
    "hanging like an oasis in his air",
    "of lost connections...."

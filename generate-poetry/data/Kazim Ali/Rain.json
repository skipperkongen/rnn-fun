    "With thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.",
    "Pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.",
    "Over the echo of the water, I hear a voice saying my name.",
    "No one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.",
    "The pages of my notebook soak, then curl. I\u2019ve written:",
    "\u201cYogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.\u201d",
    "The sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face.",
    "The window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.",
    "I am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled.",
    "If I open my mouth now, I could drown in the rain.",
    "I hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me.",
    "The night collapses into your skin. I am the rain."

    "The books were all torn apart, sliced along the spines",
    "Light filled all the openings that she in her silence renounced",
    "Still: her handwriting on the papers remembered us to her",
    "The careful matching of the papers\u2019 edges was a road back",
    "One night Muhummad was borne aloft by a winged horse",
    "Taken from the Near Mosque to the Far Mosque",
    "Each book likens itself to lichen,",
    "stitching softly to tree trunks, to rocks",
    "what was given into the Prophet\u2019s ears that night:",
    "A changing of directions\u2014now all the scattered tribes must pray:",
    "Well you be found here, foundered and found"

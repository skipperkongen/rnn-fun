    "with the tempo of a rosary being strung",

    "the countinghouse of my chest",
    "but the heart does make an awful attempt",
    "and a circle wherever it may be",
    "there was music coming on",
    "which though machinery-like",
    "moves not in cogs, and never",
    "springs, but waves through",
    "like wired applause for antic backstage",
    "buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it",
    "fades",
    "but only after the chorus has pulsed",
    "it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain",
    "water gone dross",
    "or it reaches the furthest point",
    "the branch turns from us, and is for some arc",
    "fully quiet...",
    "until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir\u2019s",
    "circuit opens to one",
    "like a pigeon unhinged, its wings",
    "in sudden white-rumped ascent",
    "unopposed by iridescence",

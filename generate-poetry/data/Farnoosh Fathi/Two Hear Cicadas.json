    "be there was music coming on",
    "BEEF: which though machinery-like",
    "moves not in cogs, and never",
    "springs, but waves through",
    "BEEF: like wired applause for antic backstage",
    "buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it",

    "BEEF: but only after the chorus has pulsed",
    "BEEF: it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain",
    "water gone dross",
    "BEEF: or it reaches the furthest point",
    "the branch turns from us, and is for some arc",
    "fully quiet...",
    "BEEF: until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's",
    "circuit opens to one",
    "BEEF: like a pigeon unhinged, its wings in sudden",
    "white-rumped ascent",
    "BEEF: unopposed by iridescence",

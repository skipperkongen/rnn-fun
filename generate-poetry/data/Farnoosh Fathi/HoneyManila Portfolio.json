    "This is not a book. Otherwise, by now",
    "We would love each other.",
    "You would not put me first,",
    "Out of a kind habit, under your coat",
    "And clutch\u2014as a sudden rain",
    "Spate down. For I've seen it done",
    "For the hardly known.",
    "No, you would know with a book you love:",
    "How nothing held your eyes",
    "The way the words did, with archer-focus:",
    "How each arrow heading toward you",
    "Was slowed by the dripping beehive",
    "On its spike\u2014",
    "Nothing else could hold what you are",
    "Still: I pressed your heart in speech and saw",
    "What a musical you let rush, nothing",
    "Else in the eyes. This is not a book,",
    "But a streak\u2014",
    "Words cross reins\u2014",
    "The brow splits, veins careen."

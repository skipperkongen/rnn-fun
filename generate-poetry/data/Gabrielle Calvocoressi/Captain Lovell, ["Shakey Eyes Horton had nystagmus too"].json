    "That\u2019s what my father said and took me",
    "to the record store so we could buy him",
    "and take him home to listen. Babe says",
    "he\u2019s so square but we go all over. We listen",
    "to music for hours and dance around",
    "the house like crazy skeletons: loose",
    "with all our bones knocking, we go,",
    "\u201cclick click click\u201d and wave our arms",
    "and shake until we rattle all the china",
    "in mom\u2019s cabinet. He turns the volume",
    "up and we spin like planets round the sun.",
    "Babe says he\u2019s no fun but I know different",
    "because I see him laughing and I",
    "which she just never does. She walks",
    "into the house with Jasper waiting in the car.",
    "She grabs some clothes or asks for money,",
    "though she doesn\u2019t even come to do that",
    "anymore. They don\u2019t even talk. Last time",
    "we had the music on loud and we were dancing.",
    "I was letting my head swing back and forth",
    "and she just stood and watched us with the strangest",
    "look and I said, \u201cI\u2019m Shakey Eyes! Come dance,\u201d",
    "and moved my arms around. I followed her up",
    "the stairs, swinging like a satellite and going,",
    "\u201cOoh ooh ooooohhhhh,\u201d just like a low-down good-",
    "for-nothing so and so. I know she thinks I\u2019m funny",
    "but she didn\u2019t laugh and I said, \u201cCome",
    "You know you\u2019ve got the blues.\u201d Then I said, \u201cYou\u2019re",
    "no fun.\u201d She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know him like I do.\u201d"

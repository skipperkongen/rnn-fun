    "My eyes are shaky and glimmer like the stars.",
    "My head turns to the left and it moves",
    "just like a pendulum. The kids laugh and shake",
    "it back to me, all the ways I\u2019m stupid,",
    "not like them. But I know how the grass sounds",
    "when the locusts come, like a spaceship",
    "taking off and how it makes the air shake.",
    "Captain Lovell, I heard it in the branches",
    "and the leaves. I heard the rocket leaving.",
    "My teacher said it wasn\u2019t so, that you\u2019re",
    "past hearing but my father said I could.",
    "He puts his hands hard on my shoulders",
    "from behind and holds my head still",
    "with his looking. But I can feel how much",
    "I want to shake and let myself go loose",
    "and double like a cloud of mayflies on the lake,",
    "you know just how they rise so you couldn\u2019t",
    "see just one of them, not even with your thumb",
    "held up to catch one with your eyes. It\u2019s something",
    "I can\u2019t do that Babe and David can, can\u2019t sight",
    "the stars or use a telescope or ever fire a gun.",
    "Dr. Lovell, I like to think you\u2019re spinning",
    "and can\u2019t feel it like I can\u2019t feel the world shake",
    "unless I\u2019m really tired and then it\u2019s like a gift",
    "to let it go and just stop trying so hard. I like",
    "to think you let go too and when the kids",
    "run at me and move their heads from left",
    "to right and call me \u201cZigzag\u201d I look up",
    "and wish myself up there with you",
    "just calm and swinging through the stars."

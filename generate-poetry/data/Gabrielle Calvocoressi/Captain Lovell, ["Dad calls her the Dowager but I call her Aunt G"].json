    "Dad calls her the Dowager but I call her Aunt G.",
    "Aunt G. at the Polo Lounge. Aunt G. drinking gimlets",
    "by the pool. Aunt G. asking about Babe even",
    "though she\u2019s the only one who sees her that much",
    "anymore. She wears ten rings. Seven on her",
    "right hand, which Dad calls the Seven Stars.",
    "They make the glass seem like it\u2019s going to crack.",
    "She doesn\u2019t like me very much. I know it.",
    "I\u2019m not her kind of girl. I won\u2019t wear dresses",
    "and when she placed the ring inside my hand",
    "I just said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Not even thinking",
    "how rude that might sound. What would I do",
    "with a ring like that? I\u2019ve got my own stars",
    "and she doesn\u2019t really want to give",
    "me presents anyway. She gave Babe a car,",
    "her dark brown Aston Martin. And she gave",
    "David a watch to \u201cremember home by.\u201d",
    "She gave my Dad a look when he said, \u201cDavid\u2019s",
    "a good soldier.\u201d Like he gave her something bad",
    "to eat. She just shook her head and said,",
    "\u201cI\u2019ll never understand what kind of man you are.\u201d",
    "And then she said Dad would have that young boy\u2019s",
    "blood on his hands. Which I don\u2019t understand.",
    "Or why she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve gone and lost the both",
    "of them. You\u2019re your very own Pol Pot,\u201d while looking",
    "through her purse. It shone so bright it blinded",
    "me. For a second I saw spots and couldn\u2019t focus",
    "on the thing. One clear stone that caught the light",
    "and made reflections on my glasses. I didn\u2019t want",
    "it. I don\u2019t wear things like that. \u201cWho are you?\u201d",
    "she asked, not in a mean way but like she truly",
    "didn\u2019t know. And didn\u2019t really care. She took it back",
    "and asked me if I\u2019d talked to Babe and I said",
    "I had not and no one else had either.",
    "I said, \u201cShe\u2019s living in the hills.\u201d",
    "And she looked at the ring for a minute",
    "and put it back in her purse."

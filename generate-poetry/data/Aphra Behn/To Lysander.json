    "I",
    "Take back that Heart, you with such Caution give,",
    "Take the fond valu\u2019d Trifle back;",
    "I hate Love-Merchants that a Trade wou\u2019d drive",
    "And meanly cunning Bargains make.",
    "II",
    "I care not how the busy Market goes,",
    "And scorn to Chaffer for a price:",
    "Love does one Staple Rate on all impose,",
    "Nor leaves it to the Trader\u2019s Choice.",
    "III",
    "A Heart requires a Heart Unfeign\u2019d and True,",
    "Though Subt\u2019ly you advance the Price,",
    "And ask a Rate that Simple Love ne\u2019er knew:",
    "And the free Trade Monopolize.",
    "IV",
    "An humble",
    "the Buyer must become,",
    "She must not bate a Look or Glance",
    "You will have all or you\u2019ll have none;",
    "See how Love\u2019s Market you inhance.",
    "V",
    "Is\u2019t not enough, I gave you Heart for Heart,",
    "But I must add my Lips and Eies;",
    "I must no friendly Smile or Kiss impart;",
    "But you must",
    "me with Advice.",
    "VI",
    "And every Hour still more unjust you grow,",
    "Those Freedoms you my life deny,",
    "You to",
    "are oblig\u2019d to show,",
    "And giver her all my Rifled Joy.",
    "VII",
    "Without Controul she gazes on that Face,",
    "And all the happy Envyed Night,",
    "In the pleas\u2019d Circle of your fond imbrace:",
    "She takes away the Lovers Right.",
    "VIII",
    "From me she Ravishes those silent hours,",
    "That are by Sacred Love my due;",
    "Whilst",
    "in vain accuse the angry Powers,",
    "That make me hopeless Love pursue.",
    "IX",
    "Ears with that dear Voice are blest,",
    "That Charms my Soul at every Sound,",
    "And with those",
    "Touches prest:",
    "Which",
    "ne\u2019er felt without a Wound.",
    "X",
    "She has thee all: whilst",
    "with silent Greif,",
    "The Fragments of they Softness feel,",
    "Yet dare not blame the happy licenc\u2019d Thief:",
    "That does my Dear-bought Pleasures steal.",
    "XI",
    "Whilst like a Glimering Taper still",
    "burn,",
    "And waste my self in my own flame,",
    "takes the welcome rich Return:",
    "And leaves me all the hopeless Pain.",
    "XII",
    "Be just, my lovely",
    "and do not take",
    "Freedoms you\u2019ll not to me allow;",
    "Or give",
    "so much Freedom back:",
    "That she may Rove as well as you.",
    "XIII",
    "Let us then love upon the honest Square,",
    "Since Interest neither have design\u2019d,",
    "For the sly Gamester, who ne\u2019er plays me fair,",
    "Must Trick for Trick expect to find."

    "Love in Fantastic Triumph sat,",
    "Whilst Bleeding Hearts around him flowed,",
    "For whom Fresh pains he did Create,",
    "And strange Tyrannic power he showed;",
    "From thy Bright Eyes he took his fire,",
    "Which round about, in sport he hurled;",
    "But \u2019twas from mine he took desire",
    "Enough to undo the Amorous World.",
    "From me he took his sighs and tears,",
    "From thee his Pride and Cruelty;",
    "From me his Languishments and Fears,",
    "And every Killing Dart from thee;",
    "Thus thou and I, the God have armed,",
    "And set him up a Deity;",
    "But my poor Heart alone is harmed,",
    "Whilst thine the Victor is, and free."

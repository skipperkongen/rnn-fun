    "Fair lovely Maid, or if that Title be",
    "Too weak, too Feminine for Nobler thee,",
    "Permit a Name that more Approaches Truth:",
    "And let me call thee, Lovely Charming Youth.",
    "This last will justifie my soft complainte,",
    "While that may serve to lessen my constraint;",
    "And without Blushes I the Youth persue,",
    "When so much beauteous Woman is in view",
    "Against thy Charms we struggle but in vain",
    "With thy deluding Form thou giv\u2019st us pain,",
    "While the bright Nymph betrays us to the Swain.",
    "In pity to our Sex sure thou wer\u2019t sent,",
    "That we might Love, and yet be Innocent:",
    "For sure no Crime with thee we can commit;",
    "Or if we shou\u2019d \u2013 thy Form excuses it.",
    "For who, that gathers fairest Flowers believes",
    "A Snake lies hid beneath the Fragrant Leaves.",
    "Thou beauteous Wonder of a different kind,",

    "When e\u2019er the Manly part of thee, wou\u2019d plead",
    "Thou tempts us with the Image of the Maid,",
    "While we the noblest Passions do extend",
    "The Love to",
    "the Friend."

    "Since man with that inconstancy was born,",
    "To love the absent, and the present scorn",
    "Why do we deck, why do we dress",
    "For such short-lived happiness?",
    "Why do we put attraction on,",
    "Since either way \u2019tis we must be undone?",
    "They fly if honour take our part,",
    "Our virtue drives \u2019em o\u2019er the field.",
    "We love \u2019em by too much desert,",
    "And oh! they fly us if we yield.",
    "Ye gods! is there no charm in all the fair",
    "To fix this wild, this faithless wanderer?",
    "Man! our great business and our aim,",
    "For whom we spread our fruitless snares,",
    "No sooner kindles the designing flame,",
    "But to the next bright object bears",
    "The trophies of his conquest and our shame:",
    "Inconstancy\u2019s the good supreme",
    "The rest is airy notion, empty dream!",
    "Then heedless nymph, be rul\u2019d by me",
    "If e\u2019re your swain the bliss desire;",
    "Think like Alexis he may be",
    "Whose wisht possession damps his fire;",
    "The roving youth in every shade",
    "Has left some sighing and abandon\u2019d maid,",
    "For \u2019tis a fatal lesson he has learn\u2019d,",
    "After fruition ne\u2019er to be concern\u2019d."

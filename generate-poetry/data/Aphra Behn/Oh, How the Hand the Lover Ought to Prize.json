    "Oh, how the hand the lover ought to prize",
    "\u2019Bove any one peculiar grace!",
    "While he is dying for the eyes",
    "And doting on the lovely face,",
    "The unconsid\u2019ring little knows",
    "How much he to this beauty owes.",
    "That, when the lover absent is,",
    "Informs him of his mistress\u2019 heart;",
    "\u2019Tis that which gives him all his bliss",
    "When dear love-secrets \u2019twill impart:",
    "That plights the faith the maid bestows,",
    "And that confirms the tim\u2019rous vows.",
    "\u2019Tis that betrays the tenderness",
    "Which the too bashful tongue denies;",
    "\u2019Tis that which does the heart confess,",
    "And spares the language of the eyes;",
    "\u2019Tis that which treasure gives so vast,",
    "Ev\u2019n Iris \u2019twill to Damon give at last."

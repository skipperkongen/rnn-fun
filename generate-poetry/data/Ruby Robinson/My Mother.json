    "She said the cornflake cake made her day,",
    "she said a man cannot be blamed for being",
    "unfaithful: his heart is not in tune with his",
    "extremities and it\u2019s just the way his body",
    "chemistry is. She said all sorts of things.",
    "We saw a duck pond and a man with a tub",
    "of maggots and a tub of sweet corn, we saw",
    "the walled garden and the old-fashioned library",
    "in the park, stopped for a cup of tea in a cafe",
    "where we had the cornflake cake cut into halves",
    "with the handle of a plastic fork. We saw yellow",
    "crocuses growing in a ring around a naked tree,",
    "the sky showing in purple triangles between",
    "the branches. We looked in the window",
    "of Butterworth\u2019s at the bikes: they were beautiful,",
    "all of them. Gorgeous, she said. The sun was",
    "pushing through the iced air and landing on us",
    "on our heads and our shoulders and the backs",
    "of our legs. We bought nail varnish remover",
    "from Wilko\u2019s, a bath sheet, and two Diet Cokes.",
    "She said she\u2019d been talking to Jesus and God",
    "because she didn\u2019t want to go to hell, although,",
    "she said, correctly, we\u2019ve been through hell",
    "already, haven\u2019t we. She said a woman should",
    "know her place, should wait. She lit a cigarette."

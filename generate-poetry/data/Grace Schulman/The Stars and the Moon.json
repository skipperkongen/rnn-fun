    "Scaling ladders with buckets of white enamel,",
    "I painted the stars and the moon on my windowpanes",
    "to hold back days and nights. I yanked the telephone",
    "and stopped the wooden clock. The weeks a lightning stroke,",
    "desire turned to love. With my blue diamond,",
    "I sliced minutes in half and made days vanish,",
    "fooling the hours.",
    "I became so skillful",
    "at firmaments that miracles occurred:",
    "a bearded comet moved across the room",
    "breeding no omens, tearing no major kingdoms",
    "into small provinces, but there it was,",
    "reminding us that rock may spin and flare,",
    "lifting the senses, burning into sight.",
    "You eased pale hands away; I saw your shoulders",
    "recede through doorways, watched your image fail",
    "with your famished smile. I left our room",
    "with dream-filled eyes, and standing in the sun,",
    "I gazed at bricks and glass and saw, suddenly,",
    "flashing in stony light, the stars and the moon."

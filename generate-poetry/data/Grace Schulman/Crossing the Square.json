    "Squinting through eye-slits in our balaclavas,",
    "we lurch across Washington Square Park",
    "hunched against the wind, two hooded figures",
    "caught in the monochrome, carrying sacks",
    "of fruit, as we\u2019ve done for years. The frosted, starch-",
    "stiff sycamores make a lean Christmas tree",
    "seem to bulk larger, tilted under the arch",
    "and still lit in three colors. Once in January,",
    "we found a feather here and stuffed the quill",
    "in twigs to recall that jay. The musical fountain",
    "is here, its water gone, a limestone circle",
    "now. Though rap succeeds the bluegrass strains",
    "we\u2019ve played in it, new praise evokes old sounds.",
    "White branches mimic visions of past storms;",
    "some say they\u2019ve heard ghosts moan above this ground,",
    "once a potter\u2019s field. No two stones are the same,",
    "of course: the drums, the tawny pears we hold,",
    "are old masks for new things. Still, in a world",
    "where fretted houses with fa\u00e7ades are leveled",
    "for condominiums, not much has altered",
    "here. At least it\u2019s faithful to imagined",
    "views. And, after all, we know the sycamore",
    "will screen the sky in a receding wind.",
    "Now, trekking home through grit that\u2019s mounting higher,",
    "faces upturned to test the whirling snow,",
    "in new masks, we whistle to make breath-clouds form",
    "and disappear, and form again, and O,",
    "my love, there\u2019s sun in the crook of your arm."

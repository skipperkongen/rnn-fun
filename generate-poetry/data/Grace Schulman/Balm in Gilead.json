    "a Negro spiritual. The baritone",
    "who chants it, leaning forward on the platform,",
    "looks up, not knowing his voice is a rainstorm",
    "that rinses air to reveal earth\u2019s surprises.",
    "Today, the summer gone, four monarch butterflies,",
    "their breed\u2019s survivors, sucked a flower\u2019s last blooms,",
    "opened their wings, orange-and-black stained glass,",
    "and printed on the sky in zigzag lines,",
    "watch bright things rise: winter moons, the white undersides",
    "of a California condor, once thought doomed,",
    "now flapping wide like the first bird from ashes."

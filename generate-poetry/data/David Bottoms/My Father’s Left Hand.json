    "Sometimes my old man\u2019s hand flutters over his knee, flaps",
    "in crazy circles, and falls back to his leg.",
    "Sometimes it leans for an hour on that bony ledge.",
    "And sometimes when my old man tries to speak, his hand waggles",
    "in the air, chasing a word, then perches again",
    "on the bar of his walker or the arm of a chair.",
    "Sometimes when evening closes down his window and rain",
    "blackens into ice on the sill, it trembles like a sparrow in a storm.",
    "Then full dark falls, and it trembles less, and less, until it\u2019s still."

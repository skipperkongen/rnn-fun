    "He is gone, the strong base of the nation,",
    "The dove to his covet has fled;",
    "Ye heroes lament his privation,",
    "For Lincoln is dead.",
    "He is gone down, the sun of the Union,",
    "Like Phoebus, that sets in the west;",
    "The planet of peace and communion,",
    "Forever has gone to his rest.",
    "He is gone down from a world of commotion,",
    "No equal succeeds in his stead;",
    "His wonders extend with the ocean,",
    "Whose waves murmur, Lincoln is dead.",
    "He is gone and can ne\u2019er be forgotten,",
    "Whose great deeds eternal shall bloom;",
    "When gold, pearls and diamonds are rotten,",
    "His deeds will break forth from the tomb.",
    "He is gone out of glory to glory,",
    "A smile with the tear may be shed,",
    "O, then let us tell the sweet story,",
    "Triumphantly, Lincoln is dead."

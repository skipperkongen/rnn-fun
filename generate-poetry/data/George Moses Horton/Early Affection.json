    "I lov\u2019d thee from the earliest dawn,",
    "When first I saw thy beauty\u2019s ray,",
    "And will, until life\u2019s eve comes on,",
    "And beauty\u2019s blossom fades away;",
    "And when all things go well with thee,",
    "With smiles and tears remember me.",
    "I\u2019ll love thee when thy morn is past,",
    "And wheedling gallantry is o\u2019er,",
    "When youth is lost in age\u2019s blast,",
    "And beauty can ascend no more,",
    "And when life\u2019s journey ends with thee,",
    "O, then look back and think of me.",
    "I\u2019ll love thee with a smile or frown,",
    "\u2019Mid sorrow\u2019s gloom or pleasure\u2019s light,",
    "And when the chain of life runs down,",
    "Pursue thy last eternal flight,",
    "When thou hast spread thy wing to flee,",
    "Still, still, a moment wait for me.",
    "I\u2019ll love thee for those sparkling eyes,",
    "To which my fondness was betray\u2019d,",
    "Bearing the tincture of the skies,",
    "To glow when other beauties fade,",
    "And when they sink too low to see,",
    "Reflect an azure beam on me."

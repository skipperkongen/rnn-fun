    "Though you live in a little country,",
    "crammed and crisscrossed with debris,",
    "the past oppressive many times over\u2014",
    "where you buy your grapes David, pausing,",
    "eyes a fiery dark girl, a lusty song",
    "riding his breath, the old dance urgent",
    "at his body; where you buy your bread",
    "Christ, stumbling, stoops to heavy lumber\u2014",
    "you insist on your own loves and griefs,",
    "on living your own life.",
    "So you love",
    "this city, but mainly as it goes on",
    "living its own life, across its roofs",
    "the lines flapping, not gaudy banners,",
    "but sheets and diapers, pants and slips,",
    "as if rehearsing private pleasures.",
    "And though you know you cannot win,",
    "you play the game with all the skill",
    "and love that you can muster, hoping",
    "to keep it, keep it going, whatever",
    "the fierceness in it, while you learn",
    "the repertoire of your opponent\u2019s wrist,",
    "the repertoire your own commands,",
    "with every stroke surprising you,",
    "as in a woman\u2019s glance the abundance",
    "glinting of her passion stored away.",
    "Those opposing roles, victor, victim",
    "both, when they require re-enacting,",
    "the moon as ever plays the luminous dome",
    "above your god-and-man-scarred rock,",
    "responsive to each nuance of the light",
    "informing it with this, the latest scene.",
    "The sweat you\u2019ve shared between you,",
    "juices drying on your hands and moon-",
    "lit belly, swirls out of the rutted, stain-",
    "stiff sheets a fragrance stronger, more",
    "anointing, than the myrrh, the frank-",
    "incense the magi brought, a gleam",
    "that would eclipse their beaten gold."

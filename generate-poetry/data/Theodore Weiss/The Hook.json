    "The students, lost in raucousness,",
    "caught as by the elder Breughel\u2019s eye,",
    "we sit in the college store",
    "over sandwiches and coffee, wondering.",
    "She answers eagerly: the place was fine;",
    "sometimes the winds grew very cold,",
    "the snows so deep and wide she lost",
    "sight of people. Yes, she was well",
    "satisfied with her work, expected\u2014",
    "while the quarry\u2019s owner was away\u2014",
    "to do another year of it.",
    "She is hammering. I hear",
    "the steady sound inside our dry,",
    "noisy days. Sparks fly; the mind,",
    "so taken, mighty for a moment,",
    "becomes quarry and sculptor both,",
    "something caught like love and war",
    "in this golden mesh: and daring",
    "caught that flings like sparks girls",
    "and boys, flagrant cities prompt",
    "to daring\u2019s will, love and war",
    "its burly seconds.",
    "I see again three kids we passed,",
    "three kids lounging at the edge",
    "of a forsaken quarry like something",
    "they had built; in its sleepy pool",
    "they found the whiteness of their bodies,",
    "the excitement like parian marble.",
    "Such the waters we find ourselves",
    "in. We sit in the college store absorbed",
    "in food and talk. Eagerness seizes us",
    "like love that leaves its best sailors",
    "in the mighty waves, love the word",
    "for hook whose catching, and the struggle",
    "there, is one great musical clash",
    "of minds\u2014each wave a passion and a mind\u2014",
    "a possessed, tumultuous monument",
    "that would be free.",
    "We strain forward",
    "as to some fabulous story. Incandescence",
    "springs from her, the hammer of remembrance",
    "fresh, the young woman, bulky graceful body,",
    "face shining, who sculptured all winter",
    "alone near the source of her rock,",
    "digging down into the difficult rock:",
    "the young woman who lost a day once,",
    "talked to her cat, and when the mirror",
    "of her art became too clear, when dreaming",
    "seemed too big for night alone, took long",
    "walks back to people, back to speech,",
    "and time:",
    "the woman, who at last\u2014",
    "\u201cI do not use live models\u201d\u2014sculptured fish\u2014",
    "\u201cI remember long lonely holidays at shores",
    "when the spray alone defined green shapes",
    "approaching\u201d\u2014has just seen (her eyes",
    "still gleam with the gleam of it,",
    "blink like the making of many",
    "a take) a great catch.",
    "April, we say,",
    "is the time for fish, for reaching",
    "in its sea-like waftings one",
    "of earth\u2019s original conclusions",
    "like the leftover gill slits",
    "the singing student told us about",
    "in this very spot just two days ago . . .",
    "we are in the middle of a great catch,",
    "there collected as from her year-long",
    "lonely rock, the thrashing, clean-",
    "scaled, clear-lit shad in the net."

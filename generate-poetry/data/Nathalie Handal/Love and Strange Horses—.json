    "One hundred breaths split the air",

    "The fields are dry. Summer is near.",
    "The horses are everywhere,",
    "strangely galloping a dream,",
    "but I can\u2019t remember",
    "how to call them,",
    "so I stand back, watch them pass.",
    "\u2014",
    "The first time I rode a horse",
    "my body found the music of fire,",
    "crackling the wind. An unbearable pleasure",
    "that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg.",
    "the horsekeeper told me,",
    "After all, departure is like",
    "pushing the weight of our heart",
    "against the village",
    "whose name has kept us awake.",

    "Rafael came from somewhere in Eurasia.",
    "I passed my hands through his mane\u2014",
    "saw a history of conquests and battles,",
    "a field of hay, a mount of truth,",
    "heard a silent ring,",
    "his eyes asking me to go with him,",
    "to confess something sacred,",
    "to name something lustful.",
    "Nothing of where he came from,",
    "or who I was, disturbed us.",

    "I knew he was different by the way he ran\u2014",
    "without pause,",
    "without grace,",
    "without distraction,",
    "without ease.",
    "He was told how to move in the world",
    "and resented it.",
    "He knew he would never own anything.",
    "\u2014",
    "He came toward me.",
    "It was a quiet afternoon.",
    "I stood unmoving.",
    "And we listened to the untitled music",
    "circling the earth like an anthem",
    "free of its nation.",
    "\u2014",
    "He was unfamiliar to me,",
    "approaching as if he possessed the land.",
    "Every morning he stopped five feet",
    "from the river."

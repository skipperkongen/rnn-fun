    "I spied everything. The North Dakota license,",
    "the \u201cBaby on Board\u201d signs, dead raccoons, and deer carcasses.",
    "The Garfields clinging to car windows\u2014the musky traces of old coffee.",
    "I was single-minded in the buzz saw tour I took through",
    "the flatlands of the country to get home. I just wanted to get there.",
    "Never mind the antecedent. I had lost stations miles ago",
    "and was living on cassettes and caffeine. Ahead, brushstrokes",
    "of smoke from annual fires. Only ahead to the last days of summer",
    "and to the dying theme of youth. How pitch-perfect",
    "the tire-on-shoulder sound was to mask the hiss of the tape deck ribbons.",
    "Everything. Perfect. As Wyoming collapses over the car",
    "like a wave. And then another mile marker. Another.",
    "How can I say this more clearly? It was like opening a heavy book,",
    "letting the pages feather themselves and finding a dried flower."

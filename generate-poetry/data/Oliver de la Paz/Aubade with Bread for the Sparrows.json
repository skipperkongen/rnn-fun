    "The snow voids the distance of the road",
    "and the first breath comes from the early morning",
    "ghosts. The sparrows with their hard eyes",
    "glisten in the difficult light. They preen",
    "their feathers and chirp. It\u2019s as though they were one",
    "voice talking to God.",
    "Mornings are a sustained hymn",
    "without the precision of faith. You\u2019ve turned the bag",
    "filled with molding bread inside out and watch",
    "the old crusts fall to the ice. What\u2019s left",
    "but to watch the daylight halved by the glistening ground?",
    "What\u2019s left but an empty bag and the dust of bread",
    "ravaged by songsters?",
    "There are ruins we witness",
    "within the moment of the world\u2019s first awakening",
    "and the birds love you within that moment. They want",
    "to eat the air and the stars they\u2019ve hungered for, little razors.",
    "Little urgent bells, the birds steal from each other\u2019s mouths",
    "which makes you hurt. Don\u2019t ask for more bread.",
    "The world is in haste to waken. Don\u2019t ask for a name",
    "you can surrender, for there are more ghosts to placate.",
    "Don\u2019t hurt for the sparrows, for they love you like a road."

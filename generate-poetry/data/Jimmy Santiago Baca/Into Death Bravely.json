    "Winter",
    "throws his great white shield",
    "on the ground,",
    "breaking thin arms of twisting branches,",
    "and then howls",
    "on the north side of the Black Mesa",
    "a deep, throaty laughter.",
    "Because of him",
    "we have to sell our cattle",
    "that rake snow for stubble.",
    "Having lived his whole life",
    "in a few weeks,",
    "slow and pensive he walks away,",
    "dragging his silver-stream shield",
    "down branches",
    "and over the ground,",
    "he keeps walking slowly away",
    "into death",
    "bravely."

    "It would be neat if with the New Year",
    "I could leave my loneliness behind with the old year.",
    "My leathery loneliness an old pair of work boots",
    "my dog vigorously head-shakes back and forth in its jaws,",
    "chews on for hours every day in my front yard\u2014",
    "rain, sun, snow, or wind",
    "in bare feet, pondering my poem,",
    "I\u2019d look out my window and see that dirty pair of boots in the yard.",
    "But my happiness depends so much on wearing those boots.",
    "At the end of my day",
    "while I\u2019m in a chair listening to a Mexican corrido",
    "I stare at my boots appreciating:",
    "all the wrong roads we\u2019ve taken, all the drug and whiskey houses",
    "we\u2019ve visited, and as the Mexican singer wails his pain,",
    "I smile at my boots, understanding every note in his voice,",
    "and strangers, when they see my boots rocking back and forth on my",
    "feet",
    "keeping beat to the song, see how",
    "my boots are scuffed, tooth-marked, worn-soled.",
    "I keep wearing them because they fit so good",
    "and I need them, especially when I love so hard,",
    "where I go up those boulder strewn trails,",
    "where flowers crack rocks in their defiant love for the light."

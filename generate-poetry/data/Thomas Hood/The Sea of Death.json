    "\u2014Methought I saw",
    "Life swiftly treading over endless space;",
    "And, at her foot-print, but a bygone pace,",
    "The ocean-past, which, with increasing wave,",
    "Swallow\u2019d her steps like a pursuing grave.",
    "Sad were my thoughts that anchor\u2019d silently",
    "On the dead waters of that passionless sea,",
    "Unstirr\u2019d by any touch of living breath:",
    "Silence hung over it, and drowsy Death,",
    "Like a gorged sea-bird, slept with folded wings",
    "On crowded carcases\u2014sad passive things",
    "That wore the thin grey surface, like a veil",
    "Over the calmness of their features pale.",
    "And there were spring-faced cherubs that did sleep",
    "Like water-lilies on that motionless deep,",
    "How beautiful! with bright unruffled hair",
    "On sleek unfretted brows, and eyes that were",
    "Buried in marble tombs, a pale eclipse!",
    "And smile-bedimpled cheeks, and pleasant lips,",
    "Meekly apart, as if the soul intense",
    "Spake out in dreams of its own innocence:",
    "And so they lay in loveliness, and kept",
    "The birth-night of their peace, that Life e\u2019en wept",
    "With very envy of their happy fronts;",
    "For there were neighbour brows scarr\u2019d by the brunts",
    "Of strife and sorrowing\u2014where Care had set",
    "His crooked autograph, and marr\u2019d the jet",
    "Of glossy locks with hollow eyes forlorn,",
    "And lips that curl\u2019d in bitterness and scorn\u2014",
    "Wretched,\u2014as they had breathed of this world\u2019s pain,",
    "And so bequeath\u2019d it to the world again",
    "Through the beholder\u2019s heart in heavy sighs.",
    "So lay they garmented in torpid light,",
    "Under the pall of a transparent night,",
    "Like solemn apparitions lull\u2019d sublime",
    "To everlasting rest,\u2014and with them Time",
    "Slept, as he sleeps upon the silent face",
    "Of a dark dial in a sunless place."

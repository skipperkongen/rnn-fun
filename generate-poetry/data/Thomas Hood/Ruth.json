    "She stood breast high amid the corn,",
    "Clasped by the golden light of morn,",
    "Like the sweetheart of the sun,",
    "Who many a glowing kiss had won.",
    "On her cheek an autumn flush,",
    "Deeply ripened;\u2014such a blush",
    "In the midst of brown was born,",
    "Like red poppies grown with corn.",
    "Round her eyes her tresses fell,",
    "Which were blackest none could tell,",
    "But long lashes veiled a light,",
    "That had else been all too bright.",
    "And her hat, with shady brim,",
    "Made her tressy forehead dim;\u2014",
    "Thus she stood amid the stooks,",
    "Praising God with sweetest looks:\u2014",
    "Sure, I said, heaven did not mean,",
    "Where I reap thou shouldst but glean,",
    "Lay thy sheaf adown and come,",
    "Share my harvest and my home."

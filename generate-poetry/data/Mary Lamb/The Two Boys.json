    "I saw a boy with eager eye",
    "Open a book upon a stall,",
    "And read as he\u2019d devour it all;",
    "Which when the stall-man did espy,",
    "Soon to the boy I heard him call,",
    "\u2018You, Sir, you never buy a book,",
    "Therefore in one you shall not look.\u2019",
    "The boy passed slowly on, and with a sigh",
    "He wished he never had been taught to read,",
    "Then of the old churl\u2019s books he should have had no need.",
    "Of sufferings the poor have many,",
    "Which never can the rich annoy.",
    "I soon perceived another boy",
    "Who looked as if he\u2019d not had any",
    "Food for that day at least, enjoy",
    "The sight of cold meat in a tavern larder.",
    "This boy\u2019s case, thought I, is surely harder,",
    "Thus hungry longing, thus without a penny,",
    "Beholding choice of dainty dressed meat;",
    "No wonder if he wish he ne\u2019er had learned to eat."

    "This rose-tree is not made to bear",
    "The violet blue, nor lily fair,",
    "Nor the sweet mignionet:",
    "And if this tree were discontent,",
    "Or wished to change its natural bent,",
    "It all in vain would fret.",
    "And should it fret, you would suppose",
    "It ne\u2019er had seen its own red rose,",
    "Nor after gentle shower",
    "Had ever smelled its rose\u2019s scent,",
    "Or it could ne\u2019er be discontent",
    "With its own pretty flower.",
    "Like such a blind and senseless tree",
    "As I\u2019ve imagined this to be,",
    "All envious persons are:",
    "With care and culture all may find",
    "Some pretty flower in their own mind,",
    "Some talent that is rare."

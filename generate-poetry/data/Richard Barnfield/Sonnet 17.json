    "Cherry-lipt Adonis in his snowie shape,",
    "Might not compare with his pure ivorie white,",
    "On whose faire front a poet\u2019s pen may write,",
    "Whose roseate red excels the crimson grape,",
    "His love-enticing delicate soft limbs,",
    "Are rarely fram\u2019d t\u2019intrap poore gazine eies:",
    "His cheeks, the lillie and carnation dies,",
    "With lovely tincture which Apollo\u2019s dims.",
    "His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,",
    "His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe,",
    "Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion.",
    "His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set.",
    "Oh how can such a body sinne-procuring,",
    "Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring?"

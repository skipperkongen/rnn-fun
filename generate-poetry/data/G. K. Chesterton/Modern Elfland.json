    "I cut a staff in a churchyard copse,",
    "I clad myself in ragged things,",
    "I set a feather in my cap",
    "That fell out of an angel\u2019s wings.",
    "I filled my wallet with white stones,",
    "I took three foxgloves in my hand,",
    "I slung my shoes across my back,",
    "And so I went to fairyland.",
    "But lo, within that ancient place",
    "Science had reared her iron crown,",
    "And the great cloud of steam went up",
    "That telleth where she takes a town.",
    "But cowled with smoke and starred with lamps,",
    "That strange land\u2019s light was still its own;",
    "The word that witched the woods and hills",
    "Spoke in the iron and the stone.",
    "Not Nature\u2019s hand had ever curved",
    "That mute unearthly porter\u2019s spine.",
    "Like sleeping dragon\u2019s sudden eyes",
    "The signals leered along the line.",
    "The chimneys thronging crooked or straight",
    "Were fingers signalling the sky;",
    "The dog that strayed across the street",
    "Seemed four-legged by monstrosity.",
    "\u2018In vain,\u2019 I cried, \u2018though you too touch",
    "The new time\u2019s desecrating hand,",
    "Through all the noises of a town",
    "I hear the heart of fairyland.\u2019",
    "I read the name above a door,",
    "Then through my spirit pealed and passed:",
    "\u2018This is the town of thine own home,",
    "And thou hast looked on it at last.\u2019"

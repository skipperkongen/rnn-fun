    "A bird flew out at the break of day",
    "From the nest where it had curled,",
    "And ere the eve the bird had set",
    "Fear on the kings of the world.",
    "The first tree it lit upon",
    "Was green with leaves unshed;",
    "The second tree it lit upon",
    "Was red with apples red;",
    "The third tree it lit upon",
    "Was barren and was brown,",
    "Save for a dead man nailed thereon",
    "On a hill above a town.",
    "That night the kings of the earth were gay",
    "And filled the cup and can;",
    "Last night the kings of the earth were chill",
    "For dread of a naked man.",
    "\u2018If he speak two more words,\u2019 they said,",
    "\u2018The slave is more than the free;",
    "If he speak three more words,\u2019 they said,",
    "\u2018The stars are under the sea.\u2019",
    "Said the King of the East to the King of the West,",
    "I wot his frown was set,",
    "\u2018Lo, let us slay him and make him as dung,",
    "It is well that the world forget.\u2019",
    "Said the King of the West to the King of the East,",
    "I wot his smile was dread,",
    "\u2018Nay, let us slay him and make him a god,",
    "It is well that our god be dead.\u2019",
    "They set the young man on a hill,",
    "They nailed him to a rod;",
    "And there in darkness and in blood",
    "They made themselves a god.",
    "And the mightiest word was left unsaid,",
    "And the world had never a mark,",
    "And the strongest man of the sons of men",
    "Went dumb into the dark.",
    "Then hymns and harps of praise they brought,",
    "Incense and gold and myrrh,",
    "And they thronged above the seraphim,",
    "The poor dead carpenter.",
    "\u2018Thou art the prince of all,\u2019 they sang,",
    "\u2018Ocean and earth and air.\u2019",
    "Then the bird flew on to the cruel cross,",
    "And hid in the dead man\u2019s hair.",
    "\u2018Thou art the son of the world.\u2019 they cried, `",
    "\u2018Speak if our prayers be heard.\u2019",
    "And the brown bird stirred in the dead man\u2019s hair",
    "And it seemed that the dead man stirred.",
    "Then a shriek went up like the world\u2019s last cry",
    "From all nations under heaven,",
    "And a master fell before a slave",
    "And begged to be forgiven.",
    "They cowered, for dread in his wakened eyes",
    "The ancient wrath to see;",
    "And a bird flew out of the dead Christ\u2019s hair,",
    "And lit on a lemon tree."

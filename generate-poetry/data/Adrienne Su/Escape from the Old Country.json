    "I never had to make one,",
    "no sickening weeks by ocean,",
    "no waiting for the aerogrammes",
    "that gradually ceased to come.",
    "Spent the babysitting money",
    "on novels, shoes, and movies,",
    "yet the neighborhood stayed empty.",
    "It had nothing to do with a journey",
    "not undertaken, not with dialect,",
    "nor with a land that waited",
    "to be rediscovered, then rejected.",
    "As acid rain collected",
    "above the suburban hills, I tried",
    "to imagine being nothing, tried",
    "to be able to claim, \u201cI have",
    "no culture,\u201d and be believed.",
    "Yet the land occupies the person",
    "even as the semblance of freedom",
    "invites a kind of recklessness.",
    "Tradition, unobserved, unasked,",
    "hangs on tight; ancestors roam",
    "into reverie, interfering at the most",
    "awkward moments, first flirtations,",
    "in doorways and dressing rooms\u2014",
    "But of course. Here in America,",
    "no one escapes. In the end, each traveler",
    "returns to the town where, everyone",
    "knew, she hadn\u2019t even been born."

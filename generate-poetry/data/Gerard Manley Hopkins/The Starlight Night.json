    "Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies!",
    "O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air!",
    "The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels there!",
    "Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the elves'-eyes!",
    "The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold lies!",
    "Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a flare!",
    "Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare!",
    "Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a prize.",
    "Buy then! bid then! \u2014 What? \u2014 Prayer, patience, alms, vows.",
    "Look, look: a May-mess, like on orchard boughs!",
    "Look! March-bloom, like on mealed-with-yellow sallows!",
    "These are indeed the barn; withindoors house",
    "The shocks. This piece-bright paling shuts the spouse",
    "Christ home, Christ and his mother and all his hallows."

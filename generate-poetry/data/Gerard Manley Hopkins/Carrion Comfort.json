    "With darksome devouring eyes my bruis\u00e8d bones? and fan,",
    "O in turns of tempest, me heaped there; me frantic to avoid thee and flee?",
    "Why? That my chaff might fly; my grain lie, sheer and clear.",
    "Nay in all that toil, that coil, since (seems) I kissed the rod,",
    "Hand rather, my heart lo! lapped strength, stole joy, would laugh, ch\u00e9er.",
    "Cheer whom though? the hero whose heaven-handling flung me, f\u00f3ot tr\u00f3d",
    "Me? or me that fought him? O which one? is it each one? That night, that year",
    "Of now done darkness I wretch lay wrestling with (my God!) my God."

    "Towery city and branchy between towers;",

    "Thou hast a base and brickish skirt there, sours",
    "That neighbour-nature thy grey beauty is grounded",
    "Best in; graceless growth, thou hast confounded",
    "Rural, rural keeping \u2014 folk, flocks, and flowers.",
    "Yet ah! this air I gather and I release",
    "He lived on; these weeds and waters, these walls are what",
    "He haunted who of all men most sways my spirits to peace;",
    "Of realty the rarest-vein\u00e8d unraveller; a not",
    "Rivalled insight, be rival Italy or Greece;",
    "Who fired France for Mary without spot."

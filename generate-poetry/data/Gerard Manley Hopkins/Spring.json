    "Nothing is so beautiful as Spring \u2013",
    "When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;",
    "Thrush\u2019s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush",
    "Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring",
    "The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;",
    "The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush",
    "The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush",
    "With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.",
    "What is all this juice and all this joy?",
    "A strain of the earth\u2019s sweet being in the beginning",
    "In Eden garden. \u2013 Have, get, before it cloy,",
    "Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,",
    "Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,",
    "Most, O maid\u2019s child, thy choice and worthy the winning."

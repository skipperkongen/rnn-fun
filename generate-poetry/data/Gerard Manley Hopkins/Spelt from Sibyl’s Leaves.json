    "Earnest, earthless, equal, attuneable, ' vaulty, voluminous, . . . stupendous",
    "Evening strains to be time\u2019s v\u00e1st, ' womb-of-all, home-of-all, hearse-of-all night.",
    "Her fond yellow hornlight wound to the west, ' her wild hollow hoarlight hung to the height",
    "Waste; her earliest stars, earl-stars, ' st\u00e1rs principal, overbend us,",
    "F\u00edre-f\u00e9aturing heaven. For earth ' her being as unbound, her dapple is at an end, as-",
    "tray or aswarm, all throughther, in throngs; ' self \u00edn self steep\u00e8d and p\u00e1shed \u2013 quite",
    "Disremembering, d\u00edsm\u00e9mbering, ' \u00e1ll now. Heart, you round me right",
    "With: \u00d3ur \u00e9vening is over us; \u00f3ur night ' wh\u00e9lms, wh\u00e9lms, \u00e1nd will end us.",
    "Only the beak-leaved boughs dragonish ' damask the tool-smooth bleak light; black,",
    "Ever so black on it. \u00d3ur tale, O \u00f3ur oracle! ' L\u00e9t life, w\u00e1ned, ah l\u00e9t life wind",
    "Off h\u00e9r once sk\u00e9ined stained v\u00e9ined var\u00edety ' upon \u00e1ll on tw\u00f3 spools; p\u00e1rt, pen, p\u00e1ck",
    "Now her \u00e1ll in tw\u00f3 flocks, tw\u00f3 folds \u2013 black, white; ' right, wrong; reckon but, reck but, mind",
    "But th\u00e9se two; w\u00e1re of a w\u00f3rld where b\u00fat these ' tw\u00f3 tell, each off the \u00f3ther; of a rack",
    "Where, selfwrung, selfstrung, sheathe- and shelterless, ' th\u00f3ughts aga\u00ednst thoughts \u00edn groans gr\u00ednd."

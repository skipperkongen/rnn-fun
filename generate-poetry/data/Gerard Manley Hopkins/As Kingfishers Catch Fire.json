    "As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;",
    "As tumbled over rim in roundy wells",
    "Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's",
    "Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;",
    "Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:",
    "Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;",
    "Selves \u2014 goes itself;",
    "it speaks and spells,",
    "Crying",
    "I say m\u00f3re: the just man justices;",
    "Keeps grace: th\u00e1t keeps all his goings graces;",
    "Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is \u2014",
    "Chr\u00edst \u2014 for Christ plays in ten thousand places,",
    "Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his",
    "To the Father through the features of men's faces."

    "Loot my point of view,",
    "hove my heart",
    "free from its hived booth",
    "though I know your smoke,",
    "its black blossom,",
    "is a substance I\u2019ll never become:",
    "colors",
    "of plaster and grass I\u2019ve prepped",
    "flawlessly, rivers I\u2019ve whittled thin.",
    "It\u2019s a personal matter to me, the wind.",
    "But let it be our cathedral feeling:",
    "a sculpture",
    "of ash",
    "dragging its robe over",
    "the hills because of us,",
    "because of me.",
    "Yellow is hurried,",
    "but red moves like a swarm",
    "through toothpick homes,",
    "pans over roofs,",
    "where the ethos we child",
    "from the ground",
    "will blacken to ruin.",
    "Let\u2019s glory",
    "this roughened nap",
    "of landscape,",
    "this parched Arcadia,",
    "with one nude-struck match and a breeze."

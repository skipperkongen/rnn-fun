    "The wind that makes your hair grow faster",
    "opens a child\u2019s mouth full of strawberry and sand.",
    "Slow and sure",
    "on the scales of the ocean",
    "the child\u2019s head outweighs the sun.",
    "Inside of the wind\u2014",
    "a blister of a church,",
    "its walls thicker than the space from wall to wall",
    "where the wind shifts shade and light",
    "like two rival chess pieces",
    "or two unmatched pieces of furniture.",
    "Inside of the church\u2014such a stillness",
    "that when a feather floats down in a fist of dust",
    "it becomes a rock by the time it hits the ground.",
    "Organ pipes glint like a cold radiator,",
    "contained in a case of a carved tree, its branches",
    "tied up with a snake.",
    "Organ pedals, golden and plump, are the tree\u2019s only fruit.",
    "It is all about the release of weight:",
    "the player crushes the pedals like grapes underneath his feet.",
    "My body, like an inaccurate cashier, adds your weight to itself.",
    "Your name, called into the wind,",
    "slows the wind down.",
    "When a body is ripe, it falls and rots from the softest spot.",
    "Only when a child slips and drops off a tree,",
    "the tree suddenly learns that it is barren."

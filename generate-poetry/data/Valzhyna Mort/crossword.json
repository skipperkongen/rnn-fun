    "a pussy clean and folded between her legs,",
    "breasts like the tips of her festive shoes",
    "shine silently in her heavy armoire.",
    "one blackbird, one cow, one horse.",
    "the sea beats against the wall of the waterless.",
    "she walks to a phone booth that waits",
    "a fair distance from all three villages.",
    "it\u2019s a game she could have heard on the radio:",
    "a question, a number, an answer, a prize.",
    "her pussy reaches up and turns on the light in her womb.",
    "and sat ourselves in the grid",
    "the receiver is silent. the bird flounces",
    "like a burglar caught red-handed.",
    "her voice stumbles over her glands.",
    "all three villages cover their faces with wind."

    "a man being taken into the mouth of a woman",
    "or being swallowed by his work",
    "it\u2019s a man traveling far inside a book",
    "a man being swallowed up in smoke",
    "he swallows the smoke, that blends around him like a thought",
    "it\u2019s a man being swallowed by a sound",

    "It\u2019s a man being swallowed by another man",
    "eaten as a pathway to god",
    "it\u2019s a man being swallowed by a sight",
    "he cannot reach, cannot touch, cannot trace",
    "it\u2019s a man who won\u2019t recognize his face",
    "who can\u2019t fit the parts, or find the place",
    "it\u2019s a man in triumph over death",
    "who laughs and beats the dust from his clothes",
    "a man tasting dust inside the laugh",

    "who exits into night at closing time",
    "the figure of a man being swallowed by a fish."

    "What makes for a happier life, Josh, comes to this:",
    "Gifts freely given, that you never earned;",
    "Open affection with your wife and kids;",
    "Clear pipes in winter, in summer screens that fit;",
    "Few days in court, with little consequence;",
    "A quiet mind, a strong body, short hours",
    "In the office; close friends who speak the truth;",
    "Good food, cooked simply; a memory that\u2019s rich",
    "Enough to build the future with; a bed",
    "In which to love, read, dream, and re-imagine love;",
    "A warm, dry field for laying down in sleep,",
    "And sleep to trim the long night coming;",
    "Knowledge of who you are, the wish to be",
    "None other; freedom to forget the time;",
    "To know the soul exceeds where it\u2019s confined",
    "Yet does not seek the terms of its release,",
    "Like a child\u2019s kite catching at the wind",
    "That flies because the hand holds tight the line."

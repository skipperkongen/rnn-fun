    "O white little lights at Carney\u2019s Point,",
    "You shine so clear o\u2019er the Delaware;",
    "When the moon rides high in the silver sky,",
    "Then you gleam, white gems on the Delaware.",
    "Diamond circlet on a full white throat,",
    "You laugh your rays on a questioning boat;",
    "Is it peace you dream in your flashing gleam,",
    "O\u2019er the quiet flow of the Delaware?",
    "And the lights grew dim at the water\u2019s brim,",
    "For the smoke of the mills shredded slow between;",
    "And the smoke was red, as is new bloodshed,",
    "And the lights went lurid \u2019neath the livid screen.",
    "O red little lights at Carney\u2019s Point,",
    "You glower so grim o\u2019er the Delaware;",
    "When the moon hides low sombrous clouds below,",
    "Then you glow like coals o\u2019er the Delaware.",
    "Blood red rubies on a throat of fire,",
    "You flash through the dusk of a funeral pyre;",
    "And there hearth fires red whom you fear and dread",
    "O\u2019er the turgid flow of the Delaware?",
    "And the lights gleamed gold o\u2019er the river cold,",
    "For the murk of the furnace shed a copper veil;",
    "And the veil was grim at the great cloud\u2019s brim,",
    "And the lights went molten, now hot, now pale.",
    "O gold little lights at Carney\u2019s Point,",
    "You gleam so proud o\u2019er the Delaware;",
    "When the moon grows wan in the eastering dawn,",
    "Then you sparkle gold points o\u2019er the Delaware.",
    "Aureate filagree on a Croesus\u2019 brow,",
    "You hasten the dawn on a gray ship\u2019s prow.",
    "Light you streams of gold in the grim ship\u2019s hold",
    "O\u2019er the sullen flow of the Delaware?",
    "And the lights went gray in the ash of day,",
    "For a quiet Aurora brought a halcyon balm;",
    "And the sun laughed high in the infinite sky,",
    "And the lights were forgot in the sweet, sane calm."

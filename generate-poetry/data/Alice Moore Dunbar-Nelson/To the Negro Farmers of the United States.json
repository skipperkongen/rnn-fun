    "God washes clean the souls and hearts of you,",
    "His favored ones, whose backs bend o\u2019er the soil,",
    "Which grudging gives to them requite for toil",
    "In sober graces and in vision true.",
    "God places in your hands the pow\u2019r to do",
    "A service sweet. Your gift supreme to foil",
    "The bare-fanged wolves of hunger in the moil",
    "Of Life\u2019s activities. Yet all too few",
    "Your glorious band, clean sprung from Nature\u2019s heart;",
    "The hope of hungry thousands, in whose breast",
    "Dwells fear that you should fail. God placed no dart",
    "Of war within your hands, but pow\u2019r to start",
    "Tears, praise, love, joy, enwoven in a crest",
    "To crown you glorious, brave ones of the soil."

    "I sit and sew\u2014a useless task it seems,",
    "My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams\u2014",
    "The panoply of war, the martial tred of men,",
    "Grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken",
    "Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,",
    "Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath\u2014",
    "But\u2014I must sit and sew.",
    "I sit and sew\u2014my heart aches with desire\u2014",
    "That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire",
    "On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things",
    "Once men. My soul in pity flings",
    "Appealing cries, yearning only to go",
    "There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe\u2014",
    "But\u2014I must sit and sew.",
    "The little useless seam, the idle patch;",
    "Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,",
    "When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,",
    "Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?",
    "You need me, Christ! It is no roseate dream",
    "That beckons me\u2014this pretty futile seam,",
    "It stifles me\u2014God, must I sit and sew?"

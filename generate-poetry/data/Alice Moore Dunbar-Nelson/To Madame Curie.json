    "Oft have I thrilled at deeds of high emprise,",
    "And yearned to venture into realms unknown,",
    "Thrice blessed she, I deemed, whom God had shown",
    "How to achieve great deeds in woman\u2019s guise.",
    "Yet what discov\u2019ry by expectant eyes",
    "Of foreign shores, could vision half the throne",
    "Full gained by her, whose power fully grown",
    "Exceeds the conquerors of th\u2019 uncharted skies?",
    "So would I be this woman whom the world",
    "Avows its benefactor; nobler far,",
    "Than Sybil, Joan, Sappho, or Egypt\u2019s queen.",
    "In the alembic forged her shafts and hurled",
    "At pain, diseases, waging a humane war;",
    "Greater than this achievement, none, I ween."

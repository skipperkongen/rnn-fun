    "When the man behind the counter said, \u201cYou pay",

    "Tonight, I find you in a box I once marked \u201cThe Past.\u201d Well,",
    "therapy\u2019s good for some things, Sandy, but who\u2019d want to forgive",
    "a girl like that? Frank says",
    "Deflated, you\u2019re simply the smile that surrounds a hole.",

    "Far, far. Ceaselessly winging,",
    "Their necks outstraining, they haste them singing",
    "Far, far. Whither, none may know.",
    "Far, far. The winds pursue them,",
    "And over the shining heaven strew them",
    "Far, far. Whither, none may know.",
    "Far, far. Each runs and races\u2014",
    "No one can catch them, they leave no traces\u2014",
    "Far, far. Whither, none may know.",
    "Far, far. Our dim eyes veiling,",
    "With bended head we go sighing, wailing",
    "Far, far. Whither none may know."

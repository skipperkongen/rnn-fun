    "Dearest, note how these two are alike:",
    "This harpsicord pavane by Purcell",
    "And the racer\u2019s twelve-speed bike.",
    "The machinery of grace is always simple.",
    "This chrome trapezoid, one wheel connected",
    "To another of concentric gears,",
    "Which Ptolemy dreamt of and Schwinn perfected,",
    "Is gone. The cyclist, not the cycle, steers.",
    "And in the playing, Purcell\u2019s chords are played away.",
    "So this talk, or touch if I were there,",
    "Should work its effortless gadgetry of love,",
    "Like Dante\u2019s heaven, and melt into the air.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t, of course, I\u2019ve fallen. So much is chance,",
    "So much agility, desire, and feverish care,",
    "As bicyclists and harpsicordists prove",
    "Who only by moving can balance,",
    "Only by balancing move."

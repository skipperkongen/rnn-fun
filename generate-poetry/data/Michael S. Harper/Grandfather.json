    "In 1915 my grandfather\u2019s",
    "neighbors surrounded his house",
    "near the dayline he ran",
    "on the Hudson",
    "in Catskill, NY",
    "and thought they\u2019d burn",
    "his family out",
    "in a movie they\u2019d just seen",
    "and be rid of his kind:",
    "the death of a lone black",
    "family is",
    ",",
    "or so they thought.",
    "His 5\u20194\u201d waiter gait",
    "quenched the white jacket smile",
    "he\u2019d brought back from watered",
    "polish of my father",
    "on the turning seats,",
    "and he asked his neighbors",
    "up on his thatched porch",
    "for the first blossom of fire",
    "that would bring him down.",
    "They went away, his nation,",
    "spittooning their torched necks",
    "in the shadows of the riverboat",
    "they\u2019d seen, posse decomposing;",
    "and I see him on Sutter",
    "with white bag from your",
    "restaurant, challenged by his first",
    "grandson to a foot-race",
    "he will win in white clothes.",
    "I see him as he buys galoshes",
    "for his railed yard near Mineo\u2019s",
    "metal shop, where roses jump",
    "as the el circles his house",
    "toward Brooklyn, where his rain fell;",
    "and I see cigar smoke in his eyes,",
    "chocolate Madison Square Garden chews",
    "he breaks on his set teeth,",
    "stitched up after cancer,",
    "the great white nation immovable",
    "as his weight wilts",
    "and he is on a porch",
    "that won\u2019t hold my arms,",
    "or the legs of the race run",
    "forwards, or the film",
    "played backwards on his grandson\u2019s eyes."

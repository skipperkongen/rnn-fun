    "They sit together on the porch, the dark",
    "Almost fallen, the house behind them dark.",
    "Their supper done with, they have washed and dried",
    "The dishes\u2013only two plates now, two glasses,",
    "Two knives, two forks, two spoons\u2013small work for two.",
    "She sits with her hands folded in her lap,",
    "At rest. He smokes his pipe. They do not speak,",
    "And when they speak at last it is to say",
    "What each one knows the other knows. They have",
    "One mind between them, now, that finally",
    "For all its knowing will not exactly know",
    "Which one goes first through the dark doorway, bidding",
    "Goodnight, and which sits on a while alone."

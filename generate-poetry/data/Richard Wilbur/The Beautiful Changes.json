    "One wading a Fall meadow finds on all sides",
    "The Queen Anne\u2019s Lace lying like lilies",
    "On water; it glides",
    "So from the walker, it turns",
    "Dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you",
    "Valleys my mind in fabulous blue Lucernes.",
    "The beautiful changes as a forest is changed",
    "By a chameleon\u2019s tuning his skin to it;",
    "As a mantis, arranged",
    "On a green leaf, grows",
    "Into it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves",
    "Any greenness is deeper than anyone knows.",
    "Your hands hold roses always in a way that says",
    "They are not only yours; the beautiful changes",
    "In such kind ways,",
    "Wishing ever to sunder",
    "Things and things\u2019 selves for a second finding, to lose",
    "For a moment all that it touches back to wonder."

    "An axe angles",
    "from my neighbor\u2019s ashcan;",
    "It is hell\u2019s handiwork,",
    "the wood not hickory,",
    "The flow of the grain",
    "not faithfully followed.",
    "The shivered shaft",
    "rises from a shellheap",
    "Of plastic playthings,",
    "paper plates,",
    "And the sheer shards",
    "of shattered tumblers",
    "That were not annealed",
    "for the time needful.",
    "At the same curbside,",
    "a cast-off cabinet",
    "Of wavily warped",
    "unseasoned wood",
    "Waits to be trundled",
    "in the trash-man\u2019s truck.",
    "Haul them off! Hide them!",
    "The heart winces",
    "For junk and gimcrack,",
    "for jerrybuilt things",
    "And the men who make them",
    "for a little money,",
    "Bartering pride",
    "like the bought boxer",
    "Who pulls his punches,",
    "or the paid-off jockey",
    "Who in the home stretch",
    "holds in his horse.",
    "Yet the things themselves",
    "in thoughtless honor",
    "Have kept composure,",
    "like captives who would not",
    "Talk under torture.",
    "Tossed from a tailgate",
    "Where the dump displays",
    "its random dolmens,",
    "Its black barrows",
    "and blazing valleys,",
    "They shall waste in the weather",
    "toward what they were.",
    "The sun shall glory",
    "in the glitter of glass-chips,",
    "Foreseeing the salvage",
    "of the prisoned sand,",
    "And the blistering paint",
    "peel off in patches,",
    "That the good grain",
    "be discovered again.",
    "Then burnt, bulldozed,",
    "they shall all be buried",
    "To the depth of diamonds,",
    "in the making dark",
    "Where halt Hephaestus",
    "keeps his hammer",
    "And Wayland\u2019s work",
    "is worn away."

    "In the frozen square, the student asks me if I will",
    "sell him the books from my backpack. He hides them",
    "under his winter coat. Steam rises from the whole",
    "wheat rolls we break open at the breakfast table.",
    "We drink hot apple tea and pronounce the skyline",
    "\u201ccharming.\u201d In a jail a man counts the visible bones,",
    "and recounts them in the blaze of morning. To turn",
    "a self to light proves painful \u2014 each piece must",
    "be dissected in turn; you pass through every feeling",
    "imaginable, so many you might make a dictionary \u2014",
    "dread to disgust, delight to degradation. The prisoner",
    "remembers wanting only to read as if in a fever \u2014",
    "running fingers over pyramids of words as if he might",
    "translate himself from this life to a more vivid existence",
    "in which he cuts open the pages with a knife in",
    "plain sight of everyone like a man eating meat and",
    "potatoes at the dinner table. Not that world; this one",
    "where blue light and sharpened files, where identikit",
    "and stamps on passports, where the book in his back-",
    "pack is a crime, and I have sold him down the river",
    "for ideas I barely value \u2014 the volumes flung carelessly",
    "across my hotel room, while he picks mushrooms on",
    "the edge of dread, pallid ghosts of what won\u2019t speak",
    "or be spoken. Or where I remember what it is to",
    "be present in the world, and I turn away, unable to",
    "bear it \u2014 so much light and dread, so much in the darkness",
    "growing or simply how hard to ever remain in place."

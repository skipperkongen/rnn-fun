    "What on Earth deserves our trust?",
    "Youth and Beauty both are dust.",
    "Long we gathering are with pain,",
    "What one moment calls again.",
    "Seven years childless marriage past,",
    "A Son, a son is born at last:",
    "So exactly lim\u2019d and fair,",
    "Full of good Spirits, Meen, and Air,",
    "As a long life promised,",
    "Yet, in less than six weeks dead.",
    "Too promising, too great a mind",
    "In so small room to be confined:",
    "Therefore, as fit in Heaven to dwell,",
    "He quickly broke the Prison shell.",
    "So the subtle Alchemist,",
    "Can\u2019t with",
    "Seal resist",
    "The powerful spirit\u2019s subtler flight,",
    "But t\u2019will bid him long good night.",
    "And so the Sun if it arise",
    "Half so glorious as his Eyes,",
    "Like this Infant, takes a shrowd,",
    "Buried in a morning Cloud."

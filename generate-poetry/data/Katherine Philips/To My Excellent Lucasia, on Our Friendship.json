    "I did not live until this time",
    "Crowned my felicity,",
    "When I could say without a crime,",
    "I am not thine, but thee.",
    "This carcass breathed, and walked, and slept,",
    "So that the world believed",
    "There was a soul the motions kept;",
    "But they were all deceived.",
    "For as a watch by art is wound",
    "To motion, such was mine:",
    "But never had Orinda found",
    "A soul till she found thine;",
    "Which now inspires, cures and supplies,",
    "And guides my darkened breast:",
    "For thou art all that I can prize,",
    "My joy, my life, my rest.",
    "No bridegroom\u2019s nor crown-conqueror\u2019s mirth",
    "To mine compared can be:",
    "They have but pieces of the earth,",
    "I\u2019ve all the world in thee.",
    "Then let our flames still light and shine,",
    "And no false fear control,",
    "As innocent as our design,",
    "Immortal as our soul."

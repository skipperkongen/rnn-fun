    "\u2019Tis now since I began to die",
    "Four months, yet still I gasping live;",
    "Wrapp\u2019d up in sorrow do I lie,",
    "Hoping, yet doubting a reprieve.",
    "Adam from Paradise expell\u2019d",
    "Just such a wretched being held.",
    "\u2019Tis not thy love I fear to lose,",
    "That will in spite of absence hold;",
    "But \u2019tis the benefit and use",
    "Is lost, as in imprison\u2019d gold:",
    "Which though the sum be ne\u2019er so great,",
    "Enriches nothing but conceit.",
    "What angry star then governs me",
    "That I must feel a double smart,",
    "Prisoner to fate as well as thee;",
    "Kept from thy face, link\u2019d to thy heart?",
    "Because my love all love excels,",
    "Must my grief have no parallels?",
    "Sapless and dead as Winter here",
    "I now remain, and all I see",
    "Copies of my wild state appear,",
    "But I am their epitome.",
    "Love me no more, for I am grown",
    "Too dead and dull for thee to own."

    "They are so beautiful, and so very young",

    "but even so, I view them with affection:",

    "Poised or clumsy, placid or high-strung,",
    "they're expert in the art of introspection,",
    "these creatures that I briefly move among\u2014",
    "And if their words don't quite trip off the tongue",
    "consistently, with just the right inflection,",
    "they remain beautiful. And very young.",
    "Still, I have to tell myself it's wrong",
    "to think of them as anything but fiction,",
    "these creatures that I briefly move among\u2014",
    "Because, like me, they're traveling headlong",
    "in that familiar, vertical direction",
    "that coarsens",

    "\u2014",
    "the two delusions we all move among."

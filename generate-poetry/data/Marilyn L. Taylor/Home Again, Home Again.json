    "The children are back, the children are back\u2014",
    "They\u2019ve come to take refuge, exhale and unpack;",

    "The company caved, the boss went broke,",
    "The job and the love affair, all up in smoke.",
    "The anguish of loneliness comes as a shock\u2014",
    "And so they return with their piles of possessions,",
    "Their terrified cats and their mournful expressions,",
    "Reclaiming the bedrooms they had in their teens,",
    "Clean towels, warm comforter, glass figurines.",
    "Downstairs in the kitchen the father and mother",
    "Don\u2019t say a word, but they look at each other",
    "As down from the hill comes Jill, comes Jack."

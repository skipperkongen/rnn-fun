    "The scent of burning wood holds",
    "the strongest memory.",
    "Mesquite, cedar, pi\u00f1on, juniper,",
    "all are distinct.",
    "Mesquite is dry desert air and mild winter.",
    "Cedar and pi\u00f1on are colder places.",
    "Winter air in our hair is pulled away,",
    "and scent of smoke settles in its place.",
    "We walk around the rest of the day",
    "with the aroma resting on our shoulders.",
    "The sweet smell holds the strongest memory.",
    "We stand around the fire.",
    "The sound of the crackle of wood and spark",
    "is ephemeral.",
    "Smoke, like memories, permeates our hair,",
    "our clothing, our layers of skin.",
    "The smoke travels deep",
    "to the seat of memory.",
    "We walk away from the fire;",
    "no matter how far we walk,",
    "we carry this scent with us.",
    "New York City, France, Germany\u2014",
    "we catch the scent of burning wood;",
    "we are brought home."

    "It may be as close as an old man in Michigan",
    "comes to the sound of the sea. Call it thunder",
    "if you want, but it\u2019s not thunder, not at all.",
    "It\u2019s more like the rush of semis on a freeway",
    "somewhere between Bay City and Flint,",
    "the road a son will take when he learns,",
    "sometime around the last taste of a strap,",
    "that the life he was born to is nothing",
    "at all like a life he\u2019d ever bother to live.",
    "There\u2019s an anger in it, a tin-edged constancy",
    "that has no rhythm, quite, something more",
    "like white noise that still won\u2019t let you sleep.",
    "Think of some man, needing to get a crop in,",
    "but the fields are sop, so he\u2019s trying to find",
    "something to fix, something to keep his hands",
    "working, something to weld, something to pound,",
    "something to wrap his calloused palms around",
    "that might do less damage than a lead-rope",
    "knotted and tossed over the limb of a tree.",
    "If you ever decide to lose your years",
    "by working this land, you might think again,",
    "about the barn you build, or roofing it with tin."

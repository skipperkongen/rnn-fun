    "I have seen enough blue-green",
    "for one day. My eyes are tired",
    "of peering at the busy speckled lines",
    "the lasered surface throws back.",
    "Outside, the light falls",
    "in jagged needles through raveled air.",
    "The world is gray.",
    "From up there, it\u2019s blue,",
    "the tiny water world, where life",
    "climbed into the air and turned green,",
    "maybe from envy that it\u2019s not",
    "somewhere else. It\u2019s not easy, being",
    "this way. It\u2019s impossible to rest",
    "with that great light going on",
    "and off always in the same place,",
    "knowing that it\u2019s necessary,",
    "unless you want to turn",
    "white, in icy quiet,",
    "against the black still motion",
    "of the tattered specks of stars.",
    "It\u2019s enough to send you running",
    "ragged, back to the sea.",
    "Down there it\u2019s blue, too,",
    "the color of deep water",
    "when at eighty feet there\u2019s no bottom",
    "and no sides to choose. Suspended,",
    "up-ended, you have no sense",
    "of proportion, lose perspective.",
    "There\u2019s only drifting with the flow,",
    "until your bubbles rip a seam",
    "upward showing you where",
    "you have to go\u2014back to the green,",
    "and then the yellow and the red,",
    "measured out in time for you",
    "to find, until you reach",
    "white, and you\u2019ve got it all.",
    "All is too much to see.",
    "We must have shades.",
    "The separation of the light",
    "exists somewhere in particles,",
    "torn into fragmentary bits to play,",
    "scattered like the fall leaves,",
    "but moving in waves\u2014hello, goodbye\u2014",
    "on a collision course with white,",
    "and black, and gray.",
    "The green of life requires blue,",
    "not too deep or too intense,",
    "just a line of blue-green held in mind,",
    "to knit tatters of shrouded days,",
    "tint the darkness,",
    "and relieve the time of glare.",
    "Once in a while",
    "you know where it belongs,",
    "in the order of the sharp-edged",
    "double bow I saw this morning,",
    "cutting its way into gray memory",
    "to even up the edges",
    "of the ragged clouds."

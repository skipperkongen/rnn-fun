    "It\u2019s said they planted trees by graves",
    "to soak up spirits of the dead",
    "through roots into the growing wood.",
    "The favorite in the burial yards",
    "I knew was common juniper.",
    "One could do worse than pass into",
    "such a species. I like to think",
    "that when I\u2019m gone the chemicals",
    "and yes the spirit that was me",
    "might be searched out by subtle roots",
    "and raised with sap through capillaries",
    "into an upright, fragrant trunk,",
    "and aromatic twigs and bark,",
    "through needles bright as hoarfrost to",
    "the sunlight for a century",
    "or more, in wood repelling rot",
    "and standing tall with monuments",
    "and statues there on the far hill,",
    "erect as truth, a testimony,",
    "in ground that\u2019s dignified by loss,",
    "around a melancholy tree",
    "that\u2019s pointing toward infinity."

    "Whither excursive Fancy tends thy Flight?",
    "Like Eastern Caliph masking thee at night,",
    "By Vezier memory attended still,",
    "Thou pertly pryest in each domicil.",
    "Woe! to the Caitiff then who in his cups,",
    "Unconscious with sublimity he sups,",
    "Shall vow in Bacchanalian truth or fun",
    "Thou art not kindred to the glorious sun!",
    "I fear thee not, clandestine ambulator!",
    "Thou most sophistical and specious traitor",
    "To Truth and Reason, those imperial twins",
    "Whose Empire with thy Martyrdom begins.",
    "What is thy drift in brandishing a flag,",
    "Whose motto is a metamorphosed rag!",
    "As by those motley streaks of white and jet,",
    "I trace that aboriginal Gazette,",
    "The British prototype of \u201965",
    "From which all modern journals we derive.",
    "At first confined to faction\u2019s revelations,",
    "Mere politics, or plodding speculations.",
    "Now to a semi-cyclopedia risen",
    "Which the assembled arts, delight to dizen.",
    "Its grand mosaic ground work ever graced",
    "With polished gems of miscellaneous taste.",
    "Philosophy his portico regains",
    "In columns where profoundest science reigns.",
    "While in relief a neighboring sphere discloses",
    "Clio\u2019s with Nature\u2019s kind exotic roses.",
    "A curious melange of mental food",
    "In fragments thus promiscuously strewed;",
    "Rising Aeronauts, and sinking funds,",
    "Fearful phenomena of stars or suns.",
    "Men in the stocks, uneasy as old Kent,",
    "Others appalled by fluctuating rent.",
    "New ministers to preach, and spirit lamps,",
    "Foreign intelligence from Courts and Camps",

    "Here, Hymen\u2019s herald to the world declares",
    "When Love triumphant at his shrine appears.",
    "There, tenderness bereaved, its tribute brings",
    "And Hope\u2019s crushed odours on Death\u2019s altar flings.",
    "Advertisements of various commodities,",
    "And anecdotes of Irish whims and oddities.",
    "Bills of mortality, and Board of Health,",
    "A fine green turtle \u2013 and a miser\u2019s wealth.",

    "The elements that form this typic world."

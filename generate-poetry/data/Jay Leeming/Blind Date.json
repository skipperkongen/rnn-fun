    "Our loneliness sits with us at dinner, an unwanted guest",

    "to use a private research library for only one night.",

    "I tell myself. But my heart is a cynical hermit",
    "who frowns once, then shuts the door of his room",
    "and starts reading a book. All I can do now is want",
    "to want her. Our polite conversation coasts",
    "like a car running on fumes, and then rolls to a stop;",
    "we split the bill, and that third guest at the table",
    "goes home with each of us, to talk and talk."

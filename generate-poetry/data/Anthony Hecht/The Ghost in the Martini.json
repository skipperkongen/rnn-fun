    "Over the rim of the glass",
    "Containing a good martini with a twist",
    "I eye her bosom and consider a pass,",
    "Certain we\u2019d not be missed",
    "In the general hubbub.",
    "Her lips, which I forgot to say, are superb,",
    "Never stop babbling once (Aye, there\u2019s the rub)",
    "But who would want to curb",
    "Such delicious, artful flattery?",
    "It seems she adores my work, the distinguished grey",
    "Of my hair. I muse on the salt and battery",
    "Of the sexual clinch, and say",
    "Something terse and gruff",
    "About the marked disparity in our ages.",
    "She looks like twenty-three, though eager enough.",
    "As for the famous wages",
    "Of sin, she can\u2019t have attained",
    "Even to union scale, though you never can tell.",
    "Her waist is slender and suggestively chained,",
    "And things are going well.",
    "The martini does its job,",
    "God bless it, seeping down to the dark old id.",
    "(\u201cIs there no cradle, Sir, you would not rob?\u201d",
    "Says ego, but the lid",
    "Is off. The word is Strike",
    "While the iron\u2019s hot.) And now, ingenuous and gay,",
    "She is asking me about what I was like",
    "At twenty. (Twenty, eh?)",
    "You wouldn\u2019t have liked me then,",
    "I answer, looking carefully into her eyes.",
    "I was shy, withdrawn, awkward, one of those men",
    "That girls seemed to despise,",
    "Moody and self-obsessed,",
    "Unhappy, defiant, with guilty dreams galore,",
    "Full of ill-natured pride, an unconfessed",
    "Snob and a thorough bore.",
    "Her smile is meant to convey",
    "How changed or modest I am, I can\u2019t tell which,",
    "When I suddenly hear someone close to me say,",
    "\u201cYou lousy son-of-a-bitch!\u201d",
    "A young man\u2019s voice, by the sound,",
    "Coming, it seems, from the twist in the martini.",
    "\u201cYou arrogant, elderly letch, you broken-down",
    "Brother of Apeneck Sweeney!",
    "Thought I was buried for good",
    "Under six thick feet of mindless self-regard?",
    "Dance on my grave, would you, you galliard stud,",
    "Silenus in leotard?",
    "Well, summon me you did,",
    "And I come unwillingly, like Samuel\u2019s ghost.",
    "something for you to toast!",
    "You only got where you are",
    "By standing upon my ectoplasmic shoulders,",
    "And wherever that is may not be so high or far",
    "In the eyes of some beholders.",
    "Take, for example, me.",
    "I have sat alone in the dark, accomplishing little,",
    "And worth no more to myself, in pride and fee,",
    "Than a cup of luke-warm spittle.",
    "But honest about it, withal . . .\u201d",
    "(\u201cWithal,\u201d forsooth!) \u201cPlease not to interrupt.",
    "And the lovelies went by, \u2018the long and the short and the tall,\u2019",
    "Hankered for, but untupped.",
    "Bloody monastic it was.",
    "A neurotic mixture of self-denial and fear;",
    "The verse halting, the cataleptic pause,",
    "No sensible pain, no tear,",
    "But an interior drip",
    "As from an ulcer, where, in the humid deep",
    "Center of myself, I would scratch and grip",
    "The wet walls of the keep,",
    "Or lie on my back and smell",
    "From the corners the sharp, ammoniac, urine stink.",
    "And plenty of time to think.",
    "In that thick, fetid air",
    "I talked to myself in giddy recitative:",
    "This prison where I live",
    "Unto the world . . .\u2019 I learned",
    "Little, and was awarded no degrees.",
    "Yet all that sunken hideousness earned",
    "Your negligence and ease.",
    "Nor was it wholly sick,",
    "Having procured you a certain modest fame;",
    "A devotion, rather, a grim device to stick",
    "To something I could not name.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile, she babbles on",
    "About men, or whatever, and the juniper juice",
    "Shuts up at last, having sung, I trust, like a swan.",
    "Still given to self-abuse!",
    "Better get out of here;",
    "If he opens his trap again it could get much worse.",
    "I touch her elbow, and, leaning toward her ear,",
    "Tell her to find her purse."

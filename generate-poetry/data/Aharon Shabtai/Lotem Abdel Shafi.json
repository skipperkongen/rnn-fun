    "The heart dies without space for love, without a moral horizon:",
    "think of it then as a bird trapped in a box.",
    "My heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence;",
    "only toward them can one really advance, that is, make progress.",
    "Without them I feel I\u2019m half a person.",
    "Romeo was born a Montague, and Juliet came from the Capulet line,",
    "and I\u2019m a disciple of Shakespeare, not Ben Gurion\u2014",
    "therefore I\u2019ll be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of Haidar Abdel Shafi.",
    "I mean this, of course, as a parable only\u2014but the parable is my measure,",
    "and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair,",
    "this isn\u2019t just some idle fancy that, out of poetic license,",
    "I place our fate in my daughter\u2019s sex.",
    "That I grant myself this imaginary gift, testifies to the extent",
    "to which we\u2019re living, still, in the underworld,",
    "where we\u2019re granted the hope and potential of an amoeba.",
    "But all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl,",
    "spring out of the ground and devour each other,",
    "until a sacred union occurs, healing the breach in the world.",
    "The Arab groom from Gaza, too, will extend to my daughter a dress",
    "on which is embroidered the Land redeemed from Apartheid\u2019s curse\u2014",
    "our Land as a whole, belonging equally to all of its offspring,",
    "and then he\u2019ll lift the veil from her face, and say to her:",
    "\u201cAnd now I take you to be my wife, Lotem Abdel Shafi.\u201d"

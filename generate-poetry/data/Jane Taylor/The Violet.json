    "Down in a green and shady bed,",
    "A modest violet grew,",
    "Its stalk was bent, it hung its head,",
    "As if to hide from view.",
    "And yet it was a lovely flower,",
    "Its colours bright and fair;",
    "It might have graced a rosy bower,",
    "Instead of hiding there,",
    "Yet there it was content to bloom,",
    "In modest tints arrayed;",
    "And there diffused its sweet perfume,",
    "Within the silent shade.",
    "Then let me to the valley go,",
    "This pretty flower to see;",
    "That I may also learn to grow",
    "In sweet humility."

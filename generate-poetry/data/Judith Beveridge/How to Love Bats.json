    "Begin in a cave.",
    "Listen to the floor boil with rodents, insects.",
    "Weep for the pups that have fallen. Later,",
    "you\u2019ll fly the narrow passages of those bones,",
    "but for now \u2014",
    "open your mouth, out will fly names",
    "like",
    ". Then,",
    "listen for a frequency",
    "lower than the seep of water, higher",
    "than an ice planet hibernating",
    "beyond a glacier of Time.",
    "Visit op shops. Hide in their closets.",
    "Breathe in the scales and dust",
    "of clothes left hanging. To the underwear",
    "and to the crumbled black silks \u2014 well,",
    "give them your imagination",
    "and plenty of line, also a night of gentle wind.",
    "By now your fingers should have",
    "touched petals open. You should have been dreaming",
    "each night of anthers and of giving",
    "to their furred beauty",
    "your nectar-loving tongue. But also,",
    "your tongue should have been practising the cold",
    "of a slippery, frog-filled pond.",
    "Go down on your elbows and knees.",
    "You\u2019ll need a spieliologist\u2019s desire for rebirth",
    "and a miner\u2019s paranoia of gases \u2014",
    "but try to find within yourself",
    "the scent of a bat-loving flower.",
    "Read books on pogroms. Never trust an owl.",
    "Its face is the biography of propaganda.",
    "Never trust a hawk. See its solutions",
    "in the fur and bones of regurgitated pellets.",
    "And have you considered the smoke",
    "yet from a moving train? You can start",
    "half an hour before sunset,",
    "but make sure the journey is long, uninterrupted",
    "and that you never discover",
    "the faces of those Trans-Siberian exiles.",
    "Spend time in the folds of curtains.",
    "Seek out boarding-school cloakrooms.",
    "Practise the gymnastics of web umbrellas.",
    "Are you",
    "floating yet, thought-light,",
    "without a keel on your breastbone?",
    "Then, meditate on your bones as piccolos,",
    "on mastering the thermals",
    "beyond the tremolo; reverberations",
    "beyond the lexical.",
    "Become adept",
    "at describing the spectacles of the echo \u2014",
    "but don\u2019t watch dark clouds",
    "passing across the moon. This may lead you",
    "to fetishes and cults that worship false gods",
    "by lapping up bowls of blood from a tomb.",
    "Practise echo-locating aerodromes,",
    "stamens. Send out rippling octaves",
    "into the fossils of dank caves \u2014",
    "then edit these soundtracks",
    "with a metronome of dripping rocks, heartbeats",
    "and with a continuous, high-scaled wondering",
    "about the evolution of your own mind.",
    "But look, I must tell you \u2014 these instructions",
    "are no manual. Months of practice",
    "may still only win you appreciation",
    "of the acoustical moth,",
    "hatred of the hawk and owl. You may need",
    "to observe further the floating black host",
    "through the hills."

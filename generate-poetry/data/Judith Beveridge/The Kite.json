    "Today I watched a boy fly his kite.",
    "It didn\u2019t crackle in the wind \u2013 but",
    "gave out a barely perceptible hum.",
    "At a certain height, I\u2019d swear I heard",
    "it sing. He could make it climb in",
    "any wind; could crank those angles up,",
    "make it veer with the precision of",
    "an insect targeting a sting; then he\u2019d",
    "let it roil in rapturous finesse, a tiny",
    "bird in mid-air courtship. When",
    "lightning cracked across the cliff \u2013",
    "(like quick pale flicks of yak-hair",
    "fly-whisks) \u2013 he stayed steady. For",
    "so long he kept his arms up, as if",
    "he knew he\u2019d hoist that kite enough.",
    "I asked if it was made of special silk,",
    "if he used some particular string \u2013",
    "and what he\u2019d heard while holding it.",
    "He looked at me from a distance,",
    "then asked about my alms bowl,",
    "my robes, and about that for which",
    "a monk lives. It was then I saw",
    "I could tell him nothing in the cohort",
    "wind, that didn\u2019t sound illusory."

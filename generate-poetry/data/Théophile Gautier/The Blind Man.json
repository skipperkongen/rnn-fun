    "A blind man, on the thoroughfare,",
    "Startle-eyed as an owl by day,",
    "Piping a dismal little air,",
    "Taps here and there, loses his way,",
    "Tootles awry his time-old ditty",
    "Undauntedly, as by his side",
    "Lopes his dog, guides him through the city,",
    "Specter diurnal, sleepy-eyed.",
    "Days, stark, wash over him, unlit;",
    "He hears the dark world\u2019s constant din",
    "And all that life unseen, as it",
    "Rolls, rushing, like a flood walled in!",
    "God knows what black chimeras haunt",
    "That brain opaque, what lot befalls;",
    "And what dire spells the mind is wont",
    "To scribble on those death-vault walls!",
    "Like prisoner grown half-mad, who, pent,",
    "Rots beneath Venice in her jail",
    "Eternal, and whose hours are spent",
    "Scratching a message with a nail...",
    "But when the torch, in tomb immured,",
    "Dies in the breath of death, maybe",
    "The soul, to shades\u2019 gloom long inured,",
    "Will see with deathly clarity!"

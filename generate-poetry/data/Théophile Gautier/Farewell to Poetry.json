    "Come, fallen angel, and your pink wings close;",
    "Doff your white robe, your rays that gild the skies;",
    "You must\u2014from heaven, where once you used to rise\u2014",
    "Streak, like a shooting star, fall into prose.",
    "Your bird\u2019s feet now must strike an earthly pose.",
    "It is no time to fly: walk! Lock your prize\u2014",
    "Your harp\u2019s fair harmonies\u2014in resting wise,",
    "Within your heart: vain, worthless treasures those!",
    "Poor child of heaven, but vainly would you sing:",
    "To them your tongue divine means not a thing!",
    "Their ear is closed to your sweet chords! But this",
    "I beg: O blue-eyed angel, first, before",
    "You leave, find my pale love, whom I adore,",
    "And give her brow one long, last farewell kiss."

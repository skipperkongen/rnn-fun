    "I",
    "I saw a plaster hand, on view",
    "In sculptor\u2019s studio, set apart...",
    "Aspasia\u2019s? Cleopatra\u2019s?... Who?",
    "This fragment\u2019s human work of art?",
    "Like lily silvered by the dawn,",
    "Frozen in kiss of snow, its light",
    "Loveliness dazzled me, and shone",
    "In poetry of purest white.",
    "Though pallid, wan, yet striking, it",
    "Spread over velvet, graceful, slender",
    "Fingers\u2014delicate, exquisite\u2014",
    "Decked thick with rings of weighty splendor.",
    "Thumb high, in serpentine-like pose,",
    "Arched in a svelte and shapely line,",
    "It lay, fine set, like one of those",
    "Hands held with proud air Florentine.",
    "Did it comb out the sultan\u2019s beard",
    "On jeweled caftan? Or, with twirls",
    "And twistings, when Don Juan appeared,",
    "Play in his lustrous, glistening curls?",
    "A courtesan\u2019s? A queen\u2019s? Did this",
    "Wrought hand a scepter wield? Which one?",
    "The paragon of fleshly bliss?",
    "Sovereignty\u2019s beauteous paragon?",
    "Doubtless, by little starts and fits,",
    "It lit, poised, in its fluttering,",
    "On the she-lion croup of its",
    "Chimera-dream, caught on the wing;",
    "The Empire\u2019s fantasies; bombastic",
    "Love of fantastic, sumptuous schemes;",
    "Voluptuous frenzies orgiastic;",
    "Impossible and futile dreams;",
    "Wild tales; poetic escapades",
    "Of hashish, Rhine-wine sorcery;",
    "Dashing Bohemian cavalcades",
    "On steeds unbridled, coursing free...",
    "Such are the things the eyes divines",
    "In that white book, by Venus written:",
    "Blank palm where she has traced the signs",
    "One reads, a-tremble, terror-smitten.",
    "II",
    "Close by, in contrast, lying there,",
    "Encushioned, was the severed hand\u2014",
    "Pungent-embalmed\u2014of Lacenaire,",
    "Assassin and scourge of the land;",
    "Curio most depraved! But, though",
    "Repulsed, I reached and touched it, still",
    "Barely cleansed of its horrors! Oh!",
    "That flesh, red-downed and deathly chill!",
    "Sallow hand, like a mummy\u2019s wrought,",
    "All yellowed, laid-out pharaoh-wise,",
    "Spreading its faun-like fingers, taut,",
    "As if to seize its tempting prize;",
    "Exuding from their tips, an itching",
    "Lusting for living flesh and gold,",
    "About to writhe, convulsed, and twitching",
    "Before their victims, as of old.",
    "Vice clawed vile hieroglyph designs",
    "Of heinous wrongs\u2014most foul, most fell\u2014",
    "In all its wrinkles, all its lines,",
    "Signs that the executioner knew well!",
    "One see its scabrous deeds large writ",
    "In the palm\u2019s bestial creases, and",
    "The boiling cauldron scalding it",
    "With every crime at sin\u2019s command;",
    "Capri\u2019s debauches libertine,",
    "Of fleshpot brothels orgy-rife",
    "Stained through with blot of blood and wine",
    "Like the old Caesar\u2019s blas\u00e9 life.",
    "At once both soft and savage, its",
    "Shape shows a curious elegance,",
    "A fearsome grace that counterfeits",
    "The gladiator\u2019s graceful stance!",
    "Crime\u2019s aristocracy! No plane,",
    "No hammer\u2019s labors ever made",
    "Its flesh tough time and time again!",
    "Its only tool, the dagger-blade...",
    "Work\u2019s honest calluses! For you",
    "We look in vain, no sign we see:",
    "Evil\u2019s false poet, butcher true\u2014",
    "A Manfred of the gutter, he!"

    "They found you under twenty feet",
    "of loose ash \u2014 one vowel",
    "solo in an archipelago",
    "of strung-out vowels and doting volcanoes \u2014",
    "\u2014 O hoop",
    "of exhilaration, O sigh of relief",
    "softening your votive mouth",
    "if not blowing off steam",
    "at the crater rim, crystalizing sulfur,",
    "poring over tomes, the trade winds",
    "and furies that fan through your realm,",
    "O citizen-king, O sonorous persona",
    "weaned on fumes and that old",
    "itinerant intonation \u2014 air",
    "your woes all over again."

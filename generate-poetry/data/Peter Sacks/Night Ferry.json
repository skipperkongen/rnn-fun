    "Blood-drop, lung of fire setting past",
    "the sea bell and wave; why am I separate",
    "from that giant burrowing into further life?",
    "The body breathes and rides",
    "a heavy-netted ocean swollen",
    "by the tide. Under the half-moon",
    "it\u2019s the lighthouse light that turns",
    "the rest of me to early nightfall,",
    "headland, home. I send it back,",
    "a mirrored flickering across cold waters.",
    "We allow ourselves the crest that breaks",
    "above the surface then re-forms.",
    "We make it human and we call it love.",
    "This wintering is my own and not the world\u2019s,",
    "although the world is wintering."

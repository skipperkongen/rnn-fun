    "Joy to the bridegroom and the bride",
    "That lie by one another\u2019s side!",
    "O fie upon the virgin beds,",
    "No loss is gain but maidenheads.",
    "Love quickly send the time may be",
    "When I shall deal my rosemary!",
    "I long to simper at a feast,",
    "To dance, and kiss, and do the rest.",
    "When I shall wed, and bedded be",
    "O then the qualm comes over me,",
    "And tells the sweetness of a theme",
    "That I ne\u2019er knew but in a dream.",
    "You ladies have the blessed nights,",
    "I pine in hope of such delights.",
    "And silly damsel only can",
    "Milk the cows\u2019 teats and think on man:",
    "And sigh and wish to taste and prove",
    "The wholesome sillabub of love.",
    "Make haste, at once twin-brothers bear;",
    "And leave new matter for a star.",
    "Women and ships are never shown",
    "So fair as when their sails be blown.",
    "Then when the midwife hears your moan,",
    "I\u2019ll sigh for grief that I have none.",
    "And you, dear knight, whose every kiss",
    "Reaps the full crop of Cupid\u2019s bliss,",
    "Now you have found, confess and tell",
    "That single sheets do make up hell.",
    "And then so charitable be",
    "To get a man to pity me."

    "that darkens the bark against which",
    "the occasional bloom-laden branch",
    "might be seen shedding petals. No.",

    "in silence under blankets. Here",
    "one was not like oneself or was",
    "quiet and wrong and did not know",
    "the words nor how to ask, who",
    "to ask. Nor why. Boy\u2019s books with flags.",
    "Everyone\u2019s born to the language; anyone",
    "can say something. For instance,",
    "that\u2019s what she called him,",
    "having no use for him after history,",
    "she thrust him into the operatic night:",
    "A woman\u2019s hand rose",
    "above the surface of the lake and caught",
    "the glistering sword, and slowly",
    "descended into the boy\u2019s refuge,",
    "his astonishment, so foreign, so little like home",
    "inferior barons formed",
    "by James I in 1611, the titles were sold",
    "and the funds went toward the plantation of Ulster.",
    "For this one would receive the right",
    "to a Field argent, a sinister hand",
    "couped the wrist gules.",
    "How foreign she was",
    "when God still cared. This is like a life,",

    "the boat rides when he took me in those days,",
    "salt water in the bay and hard slaps against the hull,",
    "back from a day of horizons, of shrimp nets,",
    "I would lie on the bow feeling anger against",
    "my whole boy\u2019s body as the engines uttered",
    "their single syllable for twenty miles back to land,",

    "doesn\u2019t dance. I make up memories",
    "but who oh love, you used to",
    "dance; who\u2019d kiss their hands?"

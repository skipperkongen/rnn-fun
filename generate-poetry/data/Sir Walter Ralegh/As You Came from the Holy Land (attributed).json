    "That have met many one,",
    "I went to the holy land,",
    "That have come, that have gone?\u201d",
    "She is neither white, nor brown,",
    "But as the heavens fair;",
    "There is none hath a form so divine",
    "In the earth, or the air.",
    "\u201cSuch a one did I meet, good sir,",
    "Such an angelic face,",
    "Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear",
    "By her gait, by her grace.\u201d",
    "She hath left me here all alone,",
    "All alone, as unknown,",
    "Who sometimes did me lead with herself,",

    "\u201cWhat\u2019s the cause that she leaves you alone,",
    "And a new way doth take,",
    "Who loved you once as her own,",
    "And her joy did you make?\u201d",
    "I have lov\u2019d her all my youth;",
    "But now old, as you see,",
    "Love likes not the falling fruit",
    "From the withered tree.",
    "Know that Love is a careless child,",
    "And forgets promise past;",
    "He is blind, he is deaf when he list,",
    "And in faith never fast.",
    "His desire is a dureless content,",
    "And a trustless joy:",
    "He is won with a world of despair,",
    "And is lost with a toy.",
    "Of womenkind such indeed is the love,",
    "Or the word love abus\u2019d,",
    "Under which many childish desires",
    "And conceits are excus\u2019d.",
    "But true love is a durable fire,",
    "In the mind ever burning,",
    "Never sick, never old, never dead,",
    "From itself never turning."

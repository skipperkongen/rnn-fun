    "Prais\u2019d be Diana\u2019s fair and harmless light;",
    "Prais\u2019d be the dews wherewith she moists the ground;",
    "Prais\u2019d be her beams, the glory of the night;",
    "Prais\u2019d be her power by which all powers abound.",
    "Prais\u2019d be her nymphs with whom she decks the woods,",
    "Prais\u2019d be her knights in whom true honour lives;",
    "Prais\u2019d be that force by which she moves the floods;",
    "Let that Diana shine which all these gives.",
    "In heaven queen she is among the spheres;",
    "In aye she mistress-like makes all things pure;",
    "Eternity in her oft change she bears;",
    "She beauty is; by her the fair endure.",
    "Time wears her not: she doth his chariot guide;",
    "Mortality below her orb is plac\u2019d;",
    "By her the virtue of the stars down slide;",
    "In her is virtue\u2019s perfect image cast.",
    "A knowledge pure it is her worth to know:",
    "With Circes let them dwell that think not so."

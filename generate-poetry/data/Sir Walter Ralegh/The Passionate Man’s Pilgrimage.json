    "Give me my scallop shell of quiet,",
    "My staff of faith to walk upon,",
    "My scrip of joy, immortal diet,",
    "My bottle of salvation,",
    "My gown of glory, hope\u2019s true gage,",
    "And thus I\u2019ll take my pilgrimage.",
    "Blood must be my body\u2019s balmer,",
    "No other balm will there be given,",
    "Whilst my soul, like a white palmer,",
    "Travels to the land of heaven;",
    "Over the silver mountains,",
    "Where spring the nectar fountains;",
    "And there I\u2019ll kiss",
    "The bowl of bliss,",
    "And drink my eternal fill",
    "On every milken hill.",
    "My soul will be a-dry before,",
    "But after it will ne\u2019er thirst more;",
    "And by the happy blissful way",
    "More peaceful pilgrims I shall see,",
    "That have shook off their gowns of clay,",
    "And go apparelled fresh like me.",
    "I\u2019ll bring them first",
    "To slake their thirst,",
    "And then to taste those nectar suckets,",
    "At the clear wells",
    "Where sweetness dwells,",
    "Drawn up by saints in crystal buckets.",
    "And when our bottles and all we",
    "Are fill\u2019d with immortality,",
    "Then the holy paths we\u2019ll travel,",
    "Strew\u2019d with rubies thick as gravel,",
    "Ceilings of diamonds, sapphire floors,",
    "High walls of coral, and pearl bowers.",
    "From thence to heaven\u2019s bribeless hall",
    "Where no corrupted voices brawl,",
    "No conscience molten into gold,",
    "Nor forg\u2019d accusers bought and sold,",
    "No cause deferr\u2019d, nor vain-spent journey,",
    "For there Christ is the king\u2019s attorney,",
    "Who pleads for all without degrees,",
    "And he hath angels, but no fees.",
    "When the grand twelve million jury",
    "Of our sins and sinful fury,",
    "\u2019Gainst our souls black verdicts give,",
    "Christ pleads his death, and then we live.",
    "Be thou my speaker, taintless pleader,",
    "Unblotted lawyer, true proceeder,",
    "Thou movest salvation even for alms,",
    "Not with a bribed lawyer\u2019s palms.",
    "And this is my eternal plea",
    "To him that made heaven, earth, and sea,",
    "Seeing my flesh must die so soon,",
    "And want a head to dine next noon,",
    "Just at the stroke when my veins start and spread,",
    "Set on my soul an everlasting head.",
    "Then am I ready, like a palmer fit,",
    "To tread those blest paths which before I writ."

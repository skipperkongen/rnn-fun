    "If Cynthia be a queen, a princess, and supreme,",
    "Keep these among the rest, or say it was a dream,",
    "For those that like, expound, and those that loathe express",
    "Meanings according as their minds are moved more or less;",
    "For writing what thou art, or showing what thou were,",
    "Adds to the one disdain, to the other but despair,",
    "Thy mind of neither needs, in both seeing it exceeds."

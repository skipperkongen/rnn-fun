    "Fortune hath taken thee away, my love,",
    "My life\u2019s soul and my soul\u2019s heaven above;",
    "Fortune hath taken thee away, my princess;",
    "My only light and my true fancy\u2019s mistress.",
    "Fortune hath taken all away from me,",
    "Fortune hath taken all by taking thee.",
    "Dead to all joy, I only live to woe,",
    "So fortune now becomes my mortal foe.",
    "In vain you eyes, you eyes do waste your tears,",
    "In vain you sighs do smoke forth my despairs,",
    "In vain you search the earth and heaven above,",
    "In vain you search, for fortune rules in love.",
    "Thus now I leave my love in fortune\u2019s hands,",
    "Thus now I leave my love in fortune\u2019s bands,",
    "And only love the sorrows due to me;",
    "Sorrow henceforth it shall my princess be.",
    "I joy in this, that fortune conquers kings;",
    "Fortune that rules on earth and earthly things",
    "Hath taken my love in spite of Cupid\u2019s might;",
    "So blind a dame did never Cupid right.",
    "With wisdom\u2019s eyes had but blind Cupid seen,",
    "Then had my love my love for ever been;",
    "But love farewell; though fortune conquer thee,",
    "No fortune base shall ever alter me."

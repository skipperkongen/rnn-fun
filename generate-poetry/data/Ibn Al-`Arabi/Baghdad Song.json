    "Oh, for corniced palace of Baghdad! not",
    "the palatial cornices of Sind\u00e1d al-H\u00edra\u2014",
    "It crowns the gardens cascading below,",
    "a virgin unveiled in a perfumed chamber.",
    "Wind plays in the branches. They bend.",
    "Lovers at last coming together.",
    "Her neck necklaced by the river Tigris,",
    "her lord our master our Im\u00e1m al-H\u00e1di,",
    "N\u00e1sir, Mans\u00far, best of caliphs,",
    "who never set out on horseback to war.",
    "God bless him long",
    "as a dove on a swaying bough's cooing,",
    "Long as smiles flash lightning",
    "(and eyes stream like clouds in answer)",
    "From a bride like the sun when the mist parts,",
    "revealing herself luminous in splendor."

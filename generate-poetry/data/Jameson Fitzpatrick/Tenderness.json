    "Yes, I was jealous when you threw the glass.",
    "I wanted the shattering against the wood-paneled floor for myself,",
    "to be the sudden diaspora of its pieces across the apartment \u2014 and last night",
    "when we fought, I wanted you to hit me so badly I begged.",
    "And the other day walking past Renewal-on-the-Bowery,",
    "when one of the men smoking unsteadily outside",
    "called me a faggot, I thought: Good. People get what they deserve.",
    "Then I wished I were more like Jesus \u2014 capable of loving",
    "all people and all things always, capable of nothing",
    "but love. I waste half my wishes this way,",
    "wishing to be virtuous. The rest, well,",
    "I don\u2019t have to tell you, do I?"

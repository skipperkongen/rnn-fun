    "before the agitations of the day",
    "have gripped you",
    "To come to the kitchen",
    "and peel a little basketball",
    "for breakfast",
    "To tear the husk",
    "like cotton padding a cloud of oil",
    "misting out of its pinprick pores",
    "clean and sharp as pepper",
    "To ease",
    "each pale pink section out of its case",
    "so carefully without breaking",
    "a single pearly cell",
    "To slide each piece",
    "into a cold blue china bowl",
    "the juice pooling until the whole",
    "fruit is divided from its skin",
    "and only then to eat",
    "so sweet",
    "a discipline",
    "precisely pointless a devout",
    "involvement of the hands and senses",
    "a pause a little emptiness",
    "each year harder to live within",
    "each year harder to live without"

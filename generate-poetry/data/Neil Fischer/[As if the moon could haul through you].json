    "As if the moon could haul through you",
    "Its tremor of light and stone,",
    "Be cleared of sound. Plough",
    "The mind's noise until it's a shine",
    "In the purl of south-bending river that bears",
    "Itself toward a blacker part of the forest.",
    "If you hum, hum through the motes of air,",
    "Perhaps your nerves will find at last",
    "A tone to which they will succumb.",
    "Be still. Be not so heavy-hearted",
    "For a moment. All is not a tomb,",
    "Blind sarcophagus staring dumb, thwarted",
    "Pleasures nailed inside. These fireflies",
    "Sweep their tracings on the evening.",
    "Weep if you must, but board what falls",
    "Away, abdomens flaring\u2014",
    "The brief, nomadic intervals."

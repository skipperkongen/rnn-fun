    "And fleetingly it seemed to him",
    "That in between one eye blink and the next",
    "Time paused, allowing time to be installed",
    "Within that countless interim,",
    "Coiled up, on hold,",
    "A memory predicted and recalled.",
    "Now, that weak muscle flexed,",
    "All that contained him started to unfold",
    "In front of him, a moving book",
    "In three dimensions he could wander through,",
    "At will, at any point, now, since, before,",
    "To feel, to listen and to look\u2014",
    "A house, or suite",
    "Of rooms around a circling corridor,",
    "And waiting there, he knew,",
    "Were all the peopled days he\u2019d not repeat.",
    "Slowly he stretched his hand to open",
    "The first door on his right. Why, this was easy:",
    "Christmas when he was seven, and his aunt",
    "Playing a polonaise by Chopin,",
    "Badly. \u201cLenore,",
    "We know you think you can, dear, but you can\u2019t.\u201d",
    "And he was resting, queasy",
    "From too much pudding. Now, another door:",
    "So far, so faint, not yet an I,",
    "A pulse of sense, he hung upon a web",
    "Of knitted blood. Above, the muffled heart",
    "Performed its mindless lullaby",
    "And in the womb",
    "He slept on half awake. That was his part",
    "Elsewhere, too, at the ebb",
    "Of his last consciousness. Another room:",
    "He recognized at once the face",
    "Of one who five years hence he would have bound",
    "As closely to him as a Siamese twin.",
    "How recklessly he would replace",
    "That loving care.",
    "Absorbed, now, in the dream of skin on skin,",
    "He whispered the profound",
    "And destined promises she\u2019d never share.",
    "He shuddered, shut it, and proceeded.",
    "So room on room, all of his scenes, arranged",
    "In simultaneous succession, played",
    "Before him, unignored, unheeded,",
    "Each a",
    "and drama, driven and yet stayed,",
    "Developing, unchanged.",
    "At last the time that paused for time to flow",
    "He saw was coming to an end.",
    "He saw himself before himself, distinct",
    "As when\u2014a life ago\u2014it came to him",
    "A single blink could comprehend,",
    "And then unfold,",
    "All time within that countless interim.",
    "He blinked. And then he blinked.",
    "And time continued as it coiled, on hold."

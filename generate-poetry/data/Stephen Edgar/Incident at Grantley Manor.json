    "Seven o\u2019clock, the time set in his mind",
    "Like herbs displayed in aspic, as the chimes",
    "Were striking. Then the squeaking of his shoes\u2019",
    "Black leather tread, pacing those measures down",
    "The first-floor hall, where sunset\u2019s apricot",
    "Was oozing nectar through the open doors.",
    "Her voice, conspiratorial and astonished,",
    "Called him across the bedroom\u2019s drowning cube",
    "Towards the window. How well Miss Waterson",
    "Remembers it: \u201cPlease come and look at this,",
    "Mr Devine;\u201d the clock on the mantelpiece",
    "Rehearsing for the hour of seven. She pointed",
    "Down. There, a moving picture on the lawn,",
    "His father, like a patient whose long months",
    "Of immobility meant learning afresh",
    "The art of walking, climbing the light\u2019s green slope",
    "Towards the summer house, looking intently",
    "As though for a cuff link or a signature.",
    "That evening he still thinks of, lying now,",
    "No longer needing lessons for his legs,",
    "How he cast back his glance and saw the windows",
    "Blazing like cats\u2019 eyes on his uselessness,",
    "And in that golden mirror, two gold figures",
    "Recording him, two shadows of dark gold\u2014",
    "Miss Waterson (was it?) and another one\u2014",
    "And then took out his watch on which the hands",
    "Were so meticulously assembling seven.",
    "Young Emily, appointed just the week",
    "Before, came rushing to the stairs\u2014she\u2019d seen",
    "Him stumble\u2014to advise Mr Devine",
    "About his father\u2019s fall. And so, almost",
    "Immobilized herself in that clinging syrup,",
    "She observed the hall clock\u2019s quaint rendition of",
    "Seven, the time set clearly in his mind",
    "Like summer herbs in aspic, as the chimes",
    "Were striking. Then the squeaking of his shoes\u2019",
    "Black leather tread, pacing those measures down",
    "The corridor, where sunset\u2019s apricot",
    "Was oozing nectar through the open doors.",
    "Her voice, companionable but astonished,",
    "Floated across the bedroom\u2019s drowning cube",
    "As he descended. How well Miss Waterson",
    "Remembers it: \u201cPlease come and look at this;\u201d",
    "And Emily, who had just been taken on",
    "That week, came rushing to the window. She pointed",
    "Down, smartly on the stroke of seven. There,",
    "A moving picture on the lawn, was old",
    "Mr Devine, like a patient whose long months",
    "Of immobility meant learning afresh",
    "The art of walking, climbing the light\u2019s green slope",
    "Abstractedly towards the rose garden.",
    "That evening he still thinks of, lying now,",
    "No longer needing lessons for his legs,",
    "How he cast back his glance and saw the windows",
    "Glaring like cats\u2019 eyes on his helplessness,",
    "And in that golden mirror, two gold figures",
    "Gesticulating, two shadows of dark gold\u2014",
    "The new girl (was it?) and another one\u2014",
    "And then took out his watch on which the hands",
    "Were so laboriously assembling seven.",
    "Miss Waterson, with Emily behind her",
    "In a panic, dashed to the stairs to find",
    "Mr Devine, anxious to let him know",
    "About his father\u2019s fall. And there they saw him,",
    "Almost immobile in that clinging syrup,",
    "And heard the hall clock\u2019s muffled tolling of",
    "Seven, the time set firmly in his mind . . ."

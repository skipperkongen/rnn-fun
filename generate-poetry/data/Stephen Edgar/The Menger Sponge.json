    "Lost from all angles but the sun\u2019s,",
    "This woken morning,",
    "It clicks its brilliance into place at once,",
    "If you follow the fall of light\u2014",
    "A spider web, head-high, adorning",
    "The woodshed\u2019s entrance like a sheet",
    "Of gold-shot fabric, metal-tight,",
    "That, even so, one handswipe could delete,",
    "Collapsing all",
    "That spacious architecture to a tacky ball.",
    "It brings to mind the mathematician\u2019s",
    "Monstrous idea,",
    "The Menger sponge, where infinite excisions",
    "Out of a solid cube delete",
    "Its substance while its form stays clear:",
    "The central ninth is cut from a square;",
    "Eight smaller squares remain; repeat",
    "For each; and so on with this lattice of air:",
    "A formula",
    "For zero volume, infinite surface area.",
    "Enough. The estuary\u2019s slung",
    "Like gold-shot cloth",
    "Over a gulf of shifting airs. Among",
    "Cloud-drifts of beaten eggwhite floats,",
    "As though confected of such froth,",
    "The mountain. Like a Chinese screen,",
    "The fabric of the view devotes",
    "Almost all blankness to this hanging scene,",
    "This one handsweep",
    "Of water, creased like the cheek of someone roused from sleep."

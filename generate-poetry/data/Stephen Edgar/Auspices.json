    "Shed by the winter hours as they decay,",
    "With slow descent",
    "Light settles through the lower sky in peach,",
    "Then mauve, then pale self-abnegating gray",
    "Against the water, now that day is spent",
    "At Bennetts Beach,",
    "Under the high withdrawing blueness, band",
    "On band, like layers in a decorative",
    "Bottle of sand,",
    "Enclosed beneath the heavens\u2019 dome, as though",
    "This were the perfect realm in which to live,",
    "Preserved, unburdened by the least demand,",
    "Or wish, to know\u2014",
    "And simply be. Along the beach convene",
    "Some silver gulls which stand around re\ufb02ecting",
    "Upon the sheen",
    "That comes and goes about their scarlet feet,",
    "And crested terns \ufb02y back and forth inspecting",
    "The shallows for a last titbit to glean,",
    "And lightly treat",
    "A two-faced wind that works its way across",
    "The metal of the sea it tries to planish",
    "And to emboss,",
    "While deep in its unbalanced buffetings",
    "Gannets alternately appear and vanish,",
    "Plunge, rise, and loft and give their heads a toss.",
    "These things, these things",
    "If the observer alters what\u2019s observed,",
    "Simple to see",
    "The brilliant creatures may not long survive",
    "Our scrutiny. And yet, what would be served",
    "By aeons of extravagance to be",
    "Merely alive,",
    "Without the knowing eye, though its regard",
    "Should bring to light what turns the world to stone?",
    "Does the same hard",
    "Attention that we boast of here abound,",
    "Or has it been and gone among the starred",
    "Immenseness\u2014meaning we must fare alone,",
    "Lost where we\u2019re found?",
    "Beyond Yacaaba Head towards the east",
    "The colors harbored in that sediment",
    "Have been released",
    "And all the lower sky is banked with ash,",
    "Dulled to gunmetal gray. In the event",
    "The gannets, calling it a day, have ceased",
    "Their white panache.",
    "Only the sandhills, looking west, declare",
    "A citrine wash that soon will vaporize",
    "Into the air,",
    "Like some faint exhalation breathed upon",
    "The night, in which a \ufb02ock of ibis rise,",
    "As though they had a mind to follow where",
    "The light has gone."

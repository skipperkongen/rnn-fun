    "The air is drenched with day, but one by one",
    "The flowers close on cue,",
    "Obedient to the declining sun.",
    "Forest and grasses, bush and leaf and stem,",
    "They cannot move (and nor, you dream, can you);",
    "It is the wind that plays with them.",
    "Only the little midges dancing still",
    "Against the evening move at will.",
    "This tiny swarm still dancing on and on",
    "Like something in a net",
    "Expanding and contracting, that late swan",
    "Towing its wake, a solitary crow",
    "Crossing the twilight in its silhouette,",
    "The fox proceeding sly and slow:",
    "They are small worlds of purpose which infuse",
    "The world around with will to choose.",
    "An animalcule in a drop of dew\u2014",
    "And so diminutive",
    "That if the human eye should look clear through",
    "That globe there would be nothing there to see\u2014",
    "Although it only has a blink to live,",
    "Yet in the face of this is free;",
    "The oak, in whose vast foliage this dot",
    "Hangs from a single leaf, is not."

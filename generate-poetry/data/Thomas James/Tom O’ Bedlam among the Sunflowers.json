    "To have gold in your back yard and not know it. . .",
    "I woke this morning before your dream had shredded",
    "And found a curious thing: flowers made of gold,",
    "Six-sided\u2014more than that\u2014broken on flagstones,",
    "Petals the color of a wedding band.",
    "You are sleeping. The morning comes up gold.",
    "Perhaps I made those flowers in my head,",
    "For I have counted snowflakes in July",
    "Blowing across my eyes like bits of calcium,",
    "And I have stepped into your dream at night,",
    "A stranger there, my body steeped in moonlight.",
    "I watched you tremble, washed in all that silver.",
    "Love, the stars have fallen into the garden",
    "And turned to frost. They have opened like a hand.",
    "It is the color that breaks out of the bedsheets.",
    "This morning the garden is littered with dry petals",
    "As yellow as the page of an old book.",
    "I step among them. They are brittle as bone china."

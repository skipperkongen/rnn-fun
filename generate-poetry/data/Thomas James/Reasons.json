    "For our own private reasons",
    "We live in each other for an hour.",
    "Stranger, I take your body and its seasons,",

    "For us. The moon hangs up there like a stone",
    "Shaken out of its proper setting.",
    "We lie down in each other. We lie down alone",
    "and watch the moon\u2019s flawed marble getting",
    "Out of hand. What are the dead doing tonight?",
    "The padlocks of their tongues embrace the black,",
    "Each syllable locked in place, tucked out of sight.",
    "Even this moon could never pull them back,",
    "Even if it held them in its arms",
    "And weighed them down with stones,",
    "Took them entirely on their own terms",
    "And piled the orchard\u2019s blossom on their bones.",
    "I am aware of your body and its dangers.",
    "I spread my cloak for you in leafy weather",
    "Where other fugitives and other strangers",
    "Will put their mouths together."

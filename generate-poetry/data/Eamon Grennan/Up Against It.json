    "It\u2019s the way they cannot understand the window",
    "they buzz and buzz against, the bees that take",
    "a wrong turn at my door and end up thus",
    "in a drift at first of almost idle curiosity,",
    "cruising the room until they find themselves",
    "smack up against it and they cannot fathom how",
    "the air has hardened and the world they know",
    "with their eyes keeps out of reach as, stuck there",
    "with all they want just in front of them, they must",
    "fling their bodies against the one unalterable law",
    "of things\u2014this fact of glass\u2014and can only go on",
    "making the sound that tethers their electric",
    "fury to what\u2019s impossible, feeling the sting in it."

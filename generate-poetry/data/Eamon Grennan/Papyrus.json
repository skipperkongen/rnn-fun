    "Acorn-brown, the girl's new nipples",
    "draw the young men's rooster eyes",
    "where a woman is fitting a man to her mouth,",
    "breathing fire, holding for dear life.",
    "Green almonds in their shells:",
    "she knifes them open one at a time and",
    "hands him a slick teardrop, cool white",
    "tasting cool white. Nothing",
    "compares with such austerities, although",
    "the skull's honeycomb of bone",
    "will break their hearts, who need hearts",
    "like a bird's wishbone, to bend, unbend",
    "at every feathery beat\u2014wishbone hearts,",
    "or something fleet and light as an ostrich's",
    "leg-bone, bearing him to where, panicked",
    "with grief, he can bury his head in sand.",
    "a scarf with black parrots on it",
    "lifts in the breeze, and a real rare bird",
    "is about to fly\u2014his head in the clouds, his life",
    "shrouded in daylight he keeps breaking."

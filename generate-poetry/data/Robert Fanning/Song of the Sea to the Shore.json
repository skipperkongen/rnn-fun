    "Unraveling velvet, wave after wave, driven",
    "by wind, unwinding by storm, by gravity thrown\u2014",
    "however, heaving to reach you, to find you, I've striven",
    "undulant, erosive, blown\u2014",
    "or lying flat as glass for your falling clear",
    "down: I can't swallow you. So why",
    "have I felt I've reached you\u2014as two reflected stars,",
    "surfaced, lie near\u2014as if the sky's",
    "close element is one in me, where starfish",
    "cleave to stones\u2014if you're so far?",
    "I've touched you, I know, but my rush",
    "subsides; our meetings only leave desire's",
    "fleeting trace. Every place I touch you",
    "changes shape. Shore, lie down\u2014",
    "undo. I'll fill your thirsty bones with blue.",
    "I'll flood your every cave and we'll be one."

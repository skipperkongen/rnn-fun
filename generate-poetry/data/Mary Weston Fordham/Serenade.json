    "Sleep, love sleep,",

    "So close those dear eyes,",
    "That borrowed their hue",
    "From the heavens so blue,",

    "Sleep, love sleep,",
    "The pale moon looks down",
    "On the valleys around,",
    "The Glow Moth is flying,",
    "The South wind is sighing,",
    "And I am low lying,",
    "With lute deftly strung,",
    "To pour out my song,",
    "Sleep, love sleep."

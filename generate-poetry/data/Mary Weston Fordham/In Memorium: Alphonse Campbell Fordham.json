    "Yes, my darling, when life\u2019s shadows",
    "Over me do darkly fall,",
    "Meet me surely at the river",
    "As I haste to obey the call.",
    "Gladly through the darksome valley,",
    "Through its portals, grim and cold,",
    "Will I hasten \u2019till my nestling",
    "Meets me at the \u201cGates of Gold.\u201d",
    "Sadly do I miss my wee one,",
    "None can fill thy vacant place,",
    "Only in my dreams I fold thee,",
    "Only then behold thy face.",
    "See thee in thy childish beauty,",
    "Clasp thy little hand in mine,",
    "Ever will these moments chain me,",
    "Ever in my heart enshrined.",
    "Little Heartsease, \u201cbud of promise,\u201d",
    "Broken off in early morn,",
    "Now can sin no more pollute thee",
    "In the angels\u2019 bosom borne.",
    "In that land no pain or anguish",
    "Ever can my child enfold,",
    "Then my darling meet thy mother",
    "Surely at the \u201cGates of Gold.\u201d"

    "My boy, not of your will nor mine",
    "You keep the mountain pass and wait,",
    "Restless, for evil gold to shine",
    "And hold you to your fate.",
    "A stronger Hand than yours gave you",
    "The lawless sword\u2014you know not why.",
    "That you must live is all too true,",
    "And other men must die.",
    "My boy, be brigand if you must,",
    "But face the traveller in your track:",
    "Stand one to one, and never thrust",
    "The dagger in his back.",
    "Nay, make no ambush of the dark.",
    "Look straight into your victim\u2019s eyes;",
    "Then\u2014let his free soul, like a lark,",
    "Fly, singing, toward the skies.",
    "My boy, if Christ must be betrayed,",
    "And you must the betrayer be,",
    "Oh, marked before the worlds were made!",
    "What help is there for me?",
    "Ah, if the prophets from their graves",
    "Demand such blood of you as this,",
    "Take Him, I say, with swords and staves,",
    "But\u2014never with a kiss!"

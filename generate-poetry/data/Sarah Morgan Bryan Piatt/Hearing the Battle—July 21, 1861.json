    "One day in the dreamy summer,",
    "On the Sabbath hills, from afar",
    "We heard the solemn echoes",
    "Of the first fierce words of war.",
    "Ah, tell me, thou veil\u00e8d Watcher",
    "Of the storm and the calm to come,",
    "How long by the sun or shadow",
    "Till these noises again are dumb.",
    "And soon in a hush and glimmer",
    "We thought of the dark, strange fight,",
    "Whose close in a ghastly quiet",
    "Lay dim in the beautiful night.",
    "Then we talk\u2019d of coldness and pallor,",
    "And of things with blinded eyes",
    "That stared at the golden stillness",
    "Of the moon in those lighted skies;",
    "And of souls, at morning wrestling",
    "In the dust with passion and moan,",
    "So far away at evening",
    "In the silence of worlds unknown.",
    "But a delicate wind beside us",
    "Was rustling the dusky hours,",
    "As it gather\u2019d the dewy odors",
    "Of the snowy jessamine-flowers.",
    "And I gave you a spray of the blossoms,",
    "And said: \u201cI shall never know",
    "How the hearts in the land are breaking,",
    "My dearest, unless you go.\u201d"

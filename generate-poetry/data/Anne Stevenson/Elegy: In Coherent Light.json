    "Sparrows are plying their chisels in the summer ivy,",
    "Chipping the seconds spark by spark out of the hours.",
    "I read in each whistling chip the sun\u2019s holography.",
    "My brain\u2019s a film, I\u2019m made of timed exposures,",
    "And pounding my ears and eyes with waves of light\u2014",
    "These animate flakes, these pictures I call sight.",
    "But now you\u2019re out of the picture, no one can keep",
    "Coherent sightings of you, except in language.",
    "All the warm rhetoric is wrong. Death isn\u2019t sleep.",
    "Faith in eternal love is love\u2019s indulgence.",
    "I prize what you wrote and meet you in what I write.",
    "We still keep house in a living tenement of words.",
    "Pull down their walls of ivy, and you kill the birds."

    "In the woods off Ivory, just out of car-shot",
    "it\u2019s not enough to say a mouse lies snug",
    "in a crib of roots, its fur sleek as babyskin,",
    "Lord the body warm. Too often a name",
    "subverts the pang it answers for, inwit of",
    "heart-light, the epiphanic clutch. I mean",
    "do you sense with more than a chill the tiny",
    "homely lumpliness of it there in the dirt",
    "as you orphan the dim of a cold October",
    "sun, no wound I can find anywhere",
    "on its, your, my small soft bodykins\u2014yikes",
    "its left ear (the inner skin pink",
    "delicate svelte) twitches a little",
    "and I have this before thought tricks it",
    "whimsically lovely wink of the soul as",
    "mouse-force taking wing until the O-no",
    "letdown when a yellow jacket backs out,",
    "O sweetmeat funk and dandle of the brain",
    "asputter as it launches over frost-curled leaves",
    "and dollarweed seed strewn on the path",
    "like medallions glimpsed the second we\u2014",
    "I mean all of us cold in the twilight\u2014fly."

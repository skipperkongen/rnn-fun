    "The kiss is, strictly speaking, a passing",
    "of",
    "twice: a bead from her mouth to his,",
    "then back, ad nauseam, and the boys who lived",
    "and died for it. The lovely girl amassing",
    "ninety-nine spirits, and in high spirits",
    "for consuming her highest amount. Once",
    "the hundredth boy arrived she starts her hunt",
    "in her haunt, a hill\u2019s field filled with fitting",
    "And every day they kissed to swap the bead",
    "and for a month he waned and wans",
    "and when he learned the truth about her tongue,",
    "he downed the bead: her true form a nine-tailed",
    "fox who could have turned human, had he kissed on."

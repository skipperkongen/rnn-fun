    "Nature\u2019s lay idiot, I taught thee to love,",
    "And in that sophistry, oh, thou dost prove",
    "Too subtle: Fool, thou didst not understand",
    "The mystic language of the eye nor hand:",
    "Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air",
    "Of sighs, and say, this lies, this sounds despair:",
    "Nor by the\u2019eye\u2019s water call a malady",
    "Desperately hot, or changing feverously.",
    "I had not taught thee then, the alphabet",
    "Of flowers, how they devicefully being set",
    "And bound up, might with speechless secrecy",
    "Deliver errands mutely, and mutually.",
    "Remember since all thy words used to be",
    "To every suitor, \u201cI, \u2019if my friends agree\u201d;",
    "Since, household charms, thy husband\u2019s name to teach,",
    "Were all the love-tricks, that thy wit could reach;",
    "And since, an hour\u2019s discourse could scarce have made",
    "One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed",
    "In broken proverbs, and torn sentences.",
    "Thou art not by so many duties his,",
    "That from the\u2019world\u2019s common having severed thee,",
    "Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see,",
    "As mine: who have with amorous delicacies",
    "Refined thee\u2019into a blissful paradise.",
    "Thy graces and good words my creatures be;",
    "I planted knowledge and life\u2019s tree in thee,",
    "Which oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas",
    "Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass?",
    "Chafe wax for others\u2019 seals? break a colt\u2019s force",
    "And leave him then, being made a ready horse?"

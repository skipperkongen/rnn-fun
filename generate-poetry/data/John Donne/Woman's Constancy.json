    "Now thou has loved me one whole day,",
    "Tomorrow when you leav\u2019st, what wilt thou say?",
    "Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?",
    "Or say that now",
    "We are not just those persons which we were?",
    "Or, that oaths made in reverential fear",
    "Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear?",
    "Or, as true deaths true marriages untie,",
    "So lovers\u2019 contracts, images of those,",
    "Bind but till sleep, death\u2019s image, them unloose?",
    "Or, your own end to justify,",
    "For having purposed change and falsehood, you",
    "Can have no way but falsehood to be true?",
    "Vain lunatic, against these \u2018scapes I could",
    "Dispute and conquer, if I would,",
    "Which I abstain to do,",
    "For by tomorrow, I may think so too."

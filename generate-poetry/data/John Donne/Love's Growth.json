    "I scarce believe my love to be so pure",
    "As I had thought it was,",
    "Because it doth endure",
    "Vicissitude, and season, as the grass;",
    "Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore",
    "My love was infinite, if spring make\u2019 it more.",
    "But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow",
    "With more, not only be no quintessence,",
    "But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense,",
    "And of the sun his working vigor borrow,",
    "Love\u2019s not so pure, and abstract, as they use",
    "To say, which have no mistress but their muse,",
    "But as all else, being elemented too,",
    "Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.",
    "And yet no greater, but more eminent,",
    "Love by the spring is grown;",
    "As, in the firmament,",
    "Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown,",
    "Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough,",
    "From love\u2019s awakened root do bud out now.",
    "If, as water stirred more circles be",
    "Produced by one, love such additions take,",
    "Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make,",
    "For they are all concentric unto thee;",
    "And though each spring do add to love new heat,",
    "As princes do in time of action get",
    "New taxes, and remit them not in peace,",
    "No winter shall abate the spring\u2019s increase."

    "bent on one thing all but lost,",

    "to thyself: thou canst, if thou list,",
    "single out, make good, one wish.",
    "This from the dumb lips of an old god",
    "who with one endless, misty hand",
    "holds out to us too much to love,",
    "and with the other\u2014crooked-fingered,",
    "crazed with veins\u2014some nights and days."

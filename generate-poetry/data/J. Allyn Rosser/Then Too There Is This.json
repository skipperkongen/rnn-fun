    "joy in the day's being done, however",
    "clumsily, and in the ticked-off lists,",
    "the packages nestling together,",
    "no one home waiting for dinner, for",
    "you, no one impatient for your touch",
    "or kind words to salve what nightly",
    "rises like heartburn, the ghost-lump feeling",
    "that one is really as alone as one had feared.",
    "One isn't, not really. Not really. Joy",
    "to see over the strip mall darkening",
    "right on schedule a neon-proof pink",
    "sunset flaring like the roof of a cat's mouth,",
    "cleanly ribbed, the clouds laddering up",
    "and lit as if by a match struck somewhere",
    "in the throat much deeper down."

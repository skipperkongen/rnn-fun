    "Once again you\u2019ve fallen for the lure",
    "of his deferral, his quick eyes\u2019 brightness",
    "slinking from the pantry of the righteous.",
    "Nothing half so sleek as self-licked fur.",
    "Not that he forgot your boots, or left",
    "A single high-aimed compliment unturned.",
    "He\u2019ll double back, affect to be concerned",
    "when he\u2019s the secret reason you\u2019re bereft,",
    "embracing you with his Houdini hold,",
    "repeating chewed-off bits of what you say",
    "so he seems loyal, you the turncoat jay.",
    "You\u2019d think by now you\u2019d learn to be consoled",
    "to know the soul he sold\u2019s not yours but his,",
    "though where yours was a hollow feeling is."

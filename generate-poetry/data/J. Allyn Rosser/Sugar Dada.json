    "Go home. It's never what you think it is,",
    "The kiss, the diamond, the slamdance pulse in the wrist.",
    "Nothing is true, my dear, not even this",
    "Rumor of passion you'll doubtless insist",
    "On perceiving in my glance. Please just",
    "Go. Home is never what you think it is.",
    "Meaning lies in meaning's absence. The mist",
    "Is always almost just about to lift.",
    "Nothing is truer. Dear, not even this",
    "Candle can explain its searing twist",
    "Of flame mounted on cool amethyst.",
    "Go on home\u2014not where you think it is,",
    "But where you would expect its comfort least,",
    "In still-black stars our century will miss",
    "Seeing. Nothingness is not as true as this",
    "Faith we grind up with denial: grist",
    "To the midnight mill; morning's catalyst.",
    "Come, let's go home, wherever you think it is.",
    "Nothing is true, my dear. Not even this."

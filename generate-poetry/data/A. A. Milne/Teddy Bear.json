    "But how does anyone begin?\u201d",
    "He thought: \u201cIt really isn\u2019\ufefft fair",
    "To grudge me exercise and air.\u201d",
    "For many weeks he pressed in vain",
    "His nose against the window-pane,",

    "The lattice window, loosely shut,",
    "Swung open. With one startled \u201cOh!\u201d",
    "Our Teddy disappeared below.",
    "There happened to be passing by",
    "A plump man with a twinkling eye,",
    "Who, seeing Teddy in the street,",

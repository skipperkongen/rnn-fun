    "Of love and parting in exceeding pain.",
    "Of parting hopeless here to meet again,",
    "Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.",
    "But by my heart of love laid bare to you.",

    "Love that foregoes you but to claim anew",
    "Beyond this passage of the gate of death,",
    "I charge you at the Judgment make it plain",
    "My love of you was life and not a breath."

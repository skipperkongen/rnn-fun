    "I loved you first: but afterwards your love",

    "Which owes the other most? my love was long,",
    "And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;",
    "I loved and guessed at you, you construed me",
    "And loved me for what might or might not be \u2013",
    "Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.",
    "For verily love knows not \u2018mine\u2019 or \u2018thine;\u2019",
    "With separate \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018thou\u2019 free love has done,",
    "For one is both and both are one in love:",
    "Rich love knows nought of \u2018thine that is not mine;\u2019",
    "Both have the strength and both the length thereof,",
    "Both of us, of the love which makes us one."

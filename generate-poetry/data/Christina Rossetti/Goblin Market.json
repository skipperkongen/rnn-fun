    "Morning and evening",
    "Maids heard the goblins cry:",
    "\u201cCome buy our orchard fruits,",
    "Come buy, come buy:",
    "Apples and quinces,",
    "Lemons and oranges,",
    "Plump unpeck\u2019d cherries,",
    "Melons and raspberries,",
    "Bloom-down-cheek\u2019d peaches,",
    "Swart-headed mulberries,",
    "Wild free-born cranberries,",
    "Crab-apples, dewberries,",
    "Pine-apples, blackberries,",
    "Apricots, strawberries;\u2014",
    "All ripe together",
    "In summer weather,\u2014",
    "Morns that pass by,",
    "Fair eves that fly;",
    "Come buy, come buy:",
    "Our grapes fresh from the vine,",
    "Pomegranates full and fine,",
    "Dates and sharp bullaces,",
    "Rare pears and greengages,",
    "Damsons and bilberries,",
    "Taste them and try:",
    "Currants and gooseberries,",
    "Bright-fire-like barberries,",
    "Figs to fill your mouth,",
    "Citrons from the South,",
    "Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;",
    "Come buy, come buy.\u201d",
    "Evening by evening",
    "Among the brookside rushes,",
    "Laura bow\u2019d her head to hear,",
    "Lizzie veil\u2019d her blushes:",
    "Crouching close together",
    "In the cooling weather,",
    "With clasping arms and cautioning lips,",
    "With tingling cheeks and finger tips.",
    "\u201cLie close,\u201d Laura said,",
    "Pricking up her golden head:",
    "\u201cWe must not look at goblin men,",
    "We must not buy their fruits:",
    "Who knows upon what soil they fed",
    "Their hungry thirsty roots?\u201d",
    "\u201cCome buy,\u201d call the goblins",
    "Hobbling down the glen.",
    "\u201cOh,\u201d cried Lizzie, \u201cLaura, Laura,",
    "You should not peep at goblin men.\u201d",
    "Lizzie cover\u2019d up her eyes,",
    "Cover\u2019d close lest they should look;",
    "Laura rear\u2019d her glossy head,",
    "And whisper\u2019d like the restless brook:",
    "\u201cLook, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,",
    "Down the glen tramp little men.",
    "One hauls a basket,",
    "One bears a plate,",
    "One lugs a golden dish",
    "Of many pounds weight.",
    "How fair the vine must grow",
    "Whose grapes are so luscious;",
    "How warm the wind must blow",
    "Through those fruit bushes.\u201d",
    "\u201cNo,\u201d said Lizzie, \u201cNo, no, no;",
    "Their offers should not charm us,",
    "Their evil gifts would harm us.\u201d",
    "She thrust a dimpled finger",
    "In each ear, shut eyes and ran:",
    "Curious Laura chose to linger",
    "Wondering at each merchant man.",
    "One had a cat\u2019s face,",
    "One whisk\u2019d a tail,",
    "One tramp\u2019d at a rat\u2019s pace,",
    "One crawl\u2019d like a snail,",
    "One like a wombat prowl\u2019d obtuse and furry,",
    "One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.",
    "She heard a voice like voice of doves",
    "Cooing all together:",
    "They sounded kind and full of loves",
    "In the pleasant weather.",
    "Laura stretch\u2019d her gleaming neck",
    "Like a rush-imbedded swan,",
    "Like a lily from the beck,",
    "Like a moonlit poplar branch,",
    "Like a vessel at the launch",
    "When its last restraint is gone.",
    "Backwards up the mossy glen",
    "Turn\u2019d and troop\u2019d the goblin men,",
    "With their shrill repeated cry,",
    "\u201cCome buy, come buy.\u201d",
    "When they reach\u2019d where Laura was",
    "They stood stock still upon the moss,",
    "Leering at each other,",
    "Brother with queer brother;",
    "Signalling each other,",
    "Brother with sly brother.",
    "One set his basket down,",
    "One rear\u2019d his plate;",
    "One began to weave a crown",
    "Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown",
    "(Men sell not such in any town);",
    "One heav\u2019d the golden weight",
    "Of dish and fruit to offer her:",
    "\u201cCome buy, come buy,\u201d was still their cry.",
    "Laura stared but did not stir,",
    "Long\u2019d but had no money:",
    "The whisk-tail\u2019d merchant bade her taste",
    "In tones as smooth as honey,",
    "The cat-faced purr\u2019d,",
    "The rat-faced spoke a word",
    "Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;",
    "One parrot-voiced and jolly",
    "Cried \u201cPretty Goblin\u201d still for \u201cPretty Polly;\u201d\u2014",
    "One whistled like a bird.",
    "But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:",
    "\u201cGood folk, I have no coin;",
    "To take were to purloin:",
    "I have no copper in my purse,",
    "I have no silver either,",
    "And all my gold is on the furze",
    "That shakes in windy weather",
    "Above the rusty heather.\u201d",
    "\u201cYou have much gold upon your head,\u201d",
    "They answer\u2019d all together:",
    "\u201cBuy from us with a golden curl.\u201d",
    "She clipp\u2019d a precious golden lock,",
    "She dropp\u2019d a tear more rare than pearl,",
    "Then suck\u2019d their fruit globes fair or red:",
    "Sweeter than honey from the rock,",
    "Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,",
    "Clearer than water flow\u2019d that juice;",
    "She never tasted such before,",
    "How should it cloy with length of use?",
    "She suck\u2019d and suck\u2019d and suck\u2019d the more",
    "Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;",
    "She suck\u2019d until her lips were sore;",
    "Then flung the emptied rinds away",
    "But gather\u2019d up one kernel stone,",
    "And knew not was it night or day",
    "As she turn\u2019d home alone.",
    "Lizzie met her at the gate",
    "Full of wise upbraidings:",
    "\u201cDear, you should not stay so late,",
    "Twilight is not good for maidens;",
    "Should not loiter in the glen",
    "In the haunts of goblin men.",
    "Do you not remember Jeanie,",
    "How she met them in the moonlight,",
    "Took their gifts both choice and many,",
    "Ate their fruits and wore their flowers",
    "Pluck\u2019d from bowers",
    "Where summer ripens at all hours?",
    "But ever in the noonlight",
    "She pined and pined away;",
    "Sought them by night and day,",
    "Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;",
    "Then fell with the first snow,",
    "While to this day no grass will grow",
    "Where she lies low:",
    "I planted daisies there a year ago",
    "That never blow.",
    "You should not loiter so.\u201d",
    "\u201cNay, hush,\u201d said Laura:",
    "\u201cNay, hush, my sister:",
    "I ate and ate my fill,",
    "Yet my mouth waters still;",
    "To-morrow night I will",
    "Buy more;\u201d and kiss\u2019d her:",
    "\u201cHave done with sorrow;",
    "I\u2019ll bring you plums to-morrow",
    "Fresh on their mother twigs,",
    "Cherries worth getting;",
    "You cannot think what figs",
    "My teeth have met in,",
    "What melons icy-cold",
    "Piled on a dish of gold",
    "Too huge for me to hold,",
    "What peaches with a velvet nap,",
    "Pellucid grapes without one seed:",
    "Odorous indeed must be the mead",
    "Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink",
    "With lilies at the brink,",
    "And sugar-sweet their sap.\u201d",
    "Golden head by golden head,",
    "Like two pigeons in one nest",
    "Folded in each other\u2019s wings,",
    "They lay down in their curtain\u2019d bed:",
    "Like two blossoms on one stem,",
    "Like two flakes of new-fall\u2019n snow,",
    "Like two wands of ivory",
    "Tipp\u2019d with gold for awful kings.",
    "Moon and stars gaz\u2019d in at them,",
    "Wind sang to them lullaby,",
    "Lumbering owls forbore to fly,",
    "Not a bat flapp\u2019d to and fro",
    "Round their rest:",
    "Cheek to cheek and breast to breast",
    "Lock\u2019d together in one nest.",
    "Early in the morning",
    "When the first cock crow\u2019d his warning,",
    "Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,",
    "Laura rose with Lizzie:",
    "Fetch\u2019d in honey, milk\u2019d the cows,",
    "Air\u2019d and set to rights the house,",
    "Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,",
    "Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,",
    "Next churn\u2019d butter, whipp\u2019d up cream,",
    "Fed their poultry, sat and sew\u2019d;",
    "Talk\u2019d as modest maidens should:",
    "Lizzie with an open heart,",
    "Laura in an absent dream,",
    "One content, one sick in part;",
    "One warbling for the mere bright day\u2019s delight,",
    "One longing for the night.",
    "At length slow evening came:",
    "They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;",
    "Lizzie most placid in her look,",
    "Laura most like a leaping flame.",
    "They drew the gurgling water from its deep;",
    "Lizzie pluck\u2019d purple and rich golden flags,",
    "Then turning homeward said: \u201cThe sunset flushes",
    "Those furthest loftiest crags;",
    "Come, Laura, not another maiden lags.",
    "No wilful squirrel wags,",
    "The beasts and birds are fast asleep.\u201d",
    "But Laura loiter\u2019d still among the rushes",
    "And said the bank was steep.",
    "And said the hour was early still",
    "The dew not fall\u2019n, the wind not chill;",
    "Listening ever, but not catching",
    "The customary cry,",
    "\u201cCome buy, come buy,\u201d",
    "With its iterated jingle",
    "Of sugar-baited words:",
    "Not for all her watching",
    "Once discerning even one goblin",
    "Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;",
    "Let alone the herds",
    "That used to tramp along the glen,",
    "In groups or single,",
    "Of brisk fruit-merchant men.",
    "Till Lizzie urged, \u201cO Laura, come;",
    "I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:",
    "You should not loiter longer at this brook:",
    "Come with me home.",
    "The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,",
    "Each glowworm winks her spark,",
    "Let us get home before the night grows dark:",
    "For clouds may gather",
    "Though this is summer weather,",
    "Put out the lights and drench us through;",
    "Then if we lost our way what should we do?\u201d",
    "Laura turn\u2019d cold as stone",
    "To find her sister heard that cry alone,",
    "That goblin cry,",
    "\u201cCome buy our fruits, come buy.\u201d",
    "Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?",
    "Must she no more such succous pasture find,",
    "Gone deaf and blind?",
    "Her tree of life droop\u2019d from the root:",
    "She said not one word in her heart\u2019s sore ache;",
    "But peering thro\u2019 the dimness, nought discerning,",
    "Trudg\u2019d home, her pitcher dripping all the way;",
    "So crept to bed, and lay",
    "Silent till Lizzie slept;",
    "Then sat up in a passionate yearning,",
    "And gnash\u2019d her teeth for baulk\u2019d desire, and wept",
    "As if her heart would break.",
    "Day after day, night after night,",
    "Laura kept watch in vain",
    "In sullen silence of exceeding pain.",
    "She never caught again the goblin cry:",
    "\u201cCome buy, come buy;\u201d\u2014",
    "She never spied the goblin men",
    "Hawking their fruits along the glen:",
    "But when the noon wax\u2019d bright",
    "Her hair grew thin and grey;",
    "She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn",
    "To swift decay and burn",
    "Her fire away.",
    "One day remembering her kernel-stone",
    "She set it by a wall that faced the south;",
    "Dew\u2019d it with tears, hoped for a root,",
    "Watch\u2019d for a waxing shoot,",
    "But there came none;",
    "It never saw the sun,",
    "It never felt the trickling moisture run:",
    "While with sunk eyes and faded mouth",
    "She dream\u2019d of melons, as a traveller sees",
    "False waves in desert drouth",
    "With shade of leaf-crown\u2019d trees,",
    "And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.",
    "She no more swept the house,",
    "Tended the fowls or cows,",
    "Fetch\u2019d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,",
    "Brought water from the brook:",
    "But sat down listless in the chimney-nook",
    "And would not eat.",
    "Tender Lizzie could not bear",
    "To watch her sister\u2019s cankerous care",
    "Yet not to share.",
    "She night and morning",
    "Caught the goblins\u2019 cry:",
    "\u201cCome buy our orchard fruits,",
    "Come buy, come buy;\u201d\u2014",
    "Beside the brook, along the glen,",
    "She heard the tramp of goblin men,",
    "The yoke and stir",
    "Poor Laura could not hear;",
    "Long\u2019d to buy fruit to comfort her,",
    "But fear\u2019d to pay too dear.",
    "She thought of Jeanie in her grave,",
    "Who should have been a bride;",
    "But who for joys brides hope to have",
    "Fell sick and died",
    "In her gay prime,",
    "In earliest winter time",
    "With the first glazing rime,",
    "With the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.",
    "Till Laura dwindling",
    "Seem\u2019d knocking at Death\u2019s door:",
    "Then Lizzie weigh\u2019d no more",
    "Better and worse;",
    "But put a silver penny in her purse,",
    "Kiss\u2019d Laura, cross\u2019d the heath with clumps of furze",
    "At twilight, halted by the brook:",
    "And for the first time in her life",
    "Began to listen and look.",
    "Laugh\u2019d every goblin",
    "When they spied her peeping:",
    "Came towards her hobbling,",
    "Flying, running, leaping,",
    "Puffing and blowing,",
    "Chuckling, clapping, crowing,",
    "Clucking and gobbling,",
    "Mopping and mowing,",
    "Full of airs and graces,",
    "Pulling wry faces,",
    "Demure grimaces,",
    "Cat-like and rat-like,",
    "Ratel- and wombat-like,",
    "Snail-paced in a hurry,",
    "Parrot-voiced and whistler,",
    "Helter skelter, hurry skurry,",
    "Chattering like magpies,",
    "Fluttering like pigeons,",
    "Gliding like fishes,\u2014",
    "Hugg\u2019d her and kiss\u2019d her:",
    "Squeez\u2019d and caress\u2019d her:",
    "Stretch\u2019d up their dishes,",
    "Panniers, and plates:",
    "\u201cLook at our apples",
    "Russet and dun,",
    "Bob at our cherries,",
    "Bite at our peaches,",
    "Citrons and dates,",
    "Grapes for the asking,",
    "Pears red with basking",
    "Out in the sun,",
    "Plums on their twigs;",
    "Pluck them and suck them,",
    "Pomegranates, figs.\u201d\u2014",
    "\u201cGood folk,\u201d said Lizzie,",
    "Mindful of Jeanie:",
    "\u201cGive me much and many: \u2014",
    "Held out her apron,",
    "Toss\u2019d them her penny.",
    "\u201cNay, take a seat with us,",
    "Honour and eat with us,\u201d",
    "They answer\u2019d grinning:",
    "\u201cOur feast is but beginning.",
    "Night yet is early,",
    "Warm and dew-pearly,",
    "Wakeful and starry:",
    "Such fruits as these",
    "No man can carry:",
    "Half their bloom would fly,",
    "Half their dew would dry,",
    "Half their flavour would pass by.",
    "Sit down and feast with us,",
    "Be welcome guest with us,",
    "Cheer you and rest with us.\u201d\u2014",
    "\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lizzie: \u201cBut one waits",
    "At home alone for me:",
    "So without further parleying,",
    "If you will not sell me any",
    "Of your fruits though much and many,",
    "Give me back my silver penny",
    "I toss\u2019d you for a fee.\u201d\u2014",
    "They began to scratch their pates,",
    "No longer wagging, purring,",
    "But visibly demurring,",
    "Grunting and snarling.",
    "One call\u2019d her proud,",
    "Cross-grain\u2019d, uncivil;",
    "Their tones wax\u2019d loud,",
    "Their looks were evil.",
    "Lashing their tails",
    "They trod and hustled her,",
    "Elbow\u2019d and jostled her,",
    "Claw\u2019d with their nails,",
    "Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,",
    "Tore her gown and soil\u2019d her stocking,",
    "Twitch\u2019d her hair out by the roots,",
    "Stamp\u2019d upon her tender feet,",
    "Held her hands and squeez\u2019d their fruits",
    "Against her mouth to make her eat.",
    "White and golden Lizzie stood,",
    "Like a lily in a flood,\u2014",
    "Like a rock of blue-vein\u2019d stone",
    "Lash\u2019d by tides obstreperously,\u2014",
    "Like a beacon left alone",
    "In a hoary roaring sea,",
    "Sending up a golden fire,\u2014",
    "Like a fruit-crown\u2019d orange-tree",
    "White with blossoms honey-sweet",
    "Sore beset by wasp and bee,\u2014",
    "Like a royal virgin town",
    "Topp\u2019d with gilded dome and spire",
    "Close beleaguer\u2019d by a fleet",
    "Mad to tug her standard down.",
    "One may lead a horse to water,",
    "Twenty cannot make him drink.",

    "Lizzie utter\u2019d not a word;",
    "Would not open lip from lip",
    "Lest they should cram a mouthful in:",
    "But laugh\u2019d in heart to feel the drip",
    "Of juice that syrupp\u2019d all her face,",
    "And lodg\u2019d in dimples of her chin,",
    "And streak\u2019d her neck which quaked like curd.",
    "At last the evil people,",
    "Worn out by her resistance,",
    "Flung back her penny, kick\u2019d their fruit",
    "Along whichever road they took,",
    "Not leaving root or stone or shoot;",
    "Some writh\u2019d into the ground,",
    "Some div\u2019d into the brook",
    "With ring and ripple,",
    "Some scudded on the gale without a sound,",
    "Some vanish\u2019d in the distance.",
    "In a smart, ache, tingle,",
    "Lizzie went her way;",
    "Knew not was it night or day;",
    "Sprang up the bank, tore thro\u2019 the furze,",
    "Threaded copse and dingle,",
    "And heard her penny jingle",
    "Bouncing in her purse,\u2014",
    "Its bounce was music to her ear.",
    "She ran and ran",
    "As if she fear\u2019d some goblin man",
    "Dogg\u2019d her with gibe or curse",
    "Or something worse:",
    "But not one goblin scurried after,",
    "Nor was she prick\u2019d by fear;",
    "The kind heart made her windy-paced",
    "That urged her home quite out of breath with haste",
    "And inward laughter.",
    "She cried, \u201cLaura,\u201d up the garden,",
    "\u201cDid you miss me?",
    "Come and kiss me.",
    "Never mind my bruises,",

    "Goblin pulp and goblin dew.",
    "Eat me, drink me, love me;",
    "Laura, make much of me;",
    "For your sake I have braved the glen",
    "And had to do with goblin merchant men.\u201d",
    "Laura started from her chair,",
    "Flung her arms up in the air,",
    "Clutch\u2019d her hair:",
    "\u201cLizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted",
    "For my sake the fruit forbidden?",
    "Must your light like mine be hidden,",
    "Your young life like mine be wasted,",
    "Undone in mine undoing,",
    "And ruin\u2019d in my ruin,",
    "Thirsty, canker\u2019d, goblin-ridden?\u201d\u2014",
    "She clung about her sister,",
    "Kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her:",
    "Tears once again",
    "Refresh\u2019d her shrunken eyes,",
    "Dropping like rain",
    "After long sultry drouth;",
    "Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,",
    "She kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her with a hungry mouth.",
    "Her lips began to scorch,",
    "That juice was wormwood to her tongue,",
    "She loath\u2019d the feast:",
    "Writhing as one possess\u2019d she leap\u2019d and sung,",
    "Rent all her robe, and wrung",
    "Her hands in lamentable haste,",
    "And beat her breast.",
    "Her locks stream\u2019d like the torch",
    "Borne by a racer at full speed,",
    "Or like the mane of horses in their flight,",
    "Or like an eagle when she stems the light",
    "Straight toward the sun,",
    "Or like a caged thing freed,",
    "Or like a flying flag when armies run.",
    "Swift fire spread through her veins, knock\u2019d at her heart,",
    "Met the fire smouldering there",
    "And overbore its lesser flame;",
    "She gorged on bitterness without a name:",
    "Ah! fool, to choose such part",
    "Of soul-consuming care!",
    "Sense fail\u2019d in the mortal strife:",
    "Like the watch-tower of a town",
    "Which an earthquake shatters down,",
    "Like a lightning-stricken mast,",
    "Like a wind-uprooted tree",
    "Spun about,",
    "Like a foam-topp\u2019d waterspout",
    "Cast down headlong in the sea,",
    "She fell at last;",
    "Pleasure past and anguish past,",
    "Is it death or is it life?",
    "Life out of death.",
    "That night long Lizzie watch\u2019d by her,",
    "Counted her pulse\u2019s flagging stir,",
    "Felt for her breath,",
    "Held water to her lips, and cool\u2019d her face",
    "With tears and fanning leaves:",
    "But when the first birds chirp\u2019d about their eaves,",
    "And early reapers plodded to the place",
    "Of golden sheaves,",
    "And dew-wet grass",
    "Bow\u2019d in the morning winds so brisk to pass,",
    "And new buds with new day",
    "Open\u2019d of cup-like lilies on the stream,",
    "Laura awoke as from a dream,",
    "Laugh\u2019d in the innocent old way,",
    "Hugg\u2019d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;",
    "Her gleaming locks show\u2019d not one thread of grey,",
    "Her breath was sweet as May",
    "And light danced in her eyes.",
    "Days, weeks, months, years",
    "Afterwards, when both were wives",
    "With children of their own;",
    "Their mother-hearts beset with fears,",
    "Their lives bound up in tender lives;",
    "Laura would call the little ones",
    "And tell them of her early prime,",
    "Those pleasant days long gone",
    "Of not-returning time:",
    "Would talk about the haunted glen,",
    "The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,",
    "Their fruits like honey to the throat",
    "But poison in the blood;",
    "(Men sell not such in any town):",
    "Would tell them how her sister stood",
    "In deadly peril to do her good,",
    "And win the fiery antidote:",
    "Then joining hands to little hands",
    "Would bid them cling together,",
    "\u201cFor there is no friend like a sister",
    "In calm or stormy weather;",
    "To cheer one on the tedious way,",
    "To fetch one if one goes astray,",
    "To lift one if one totters down,",
    "To strengthen whilst one stands.\u201d"

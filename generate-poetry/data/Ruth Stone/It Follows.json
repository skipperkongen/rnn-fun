    "If you had a lot of money",
    "(by some coincidence",
    "you\u2019re at the Nassau Inn in Princeton",
    "getting a whiff of class)",
    "and you just noticed two days ago",
    "that your face has fallen,",
    "but you don\u2019t believe it,",
    "so every time you look in the glass",
    "it\u2019s still hanging there where it wasn\u2019t.",
    "Would you take the money you needed",
    "for a new roof on your old house",
    "(the house you\u2019re paying for",
    "over and over in property taxes)",
    "because it\u2019s been leaking for years",
    "and you\u2019re tired of emptying buckets",
    "and spraying for mold,",
    "would you take that money",
    "and get your face lifted?",
    "Face-lift. They cut a slit",
    "under your ears and pull up the slack",
    "and they tack it with plastic.",
    "Then they pull up the outer",
    "skin and trim it because it\u2019s too long and",
    "fasten that. (Your skin",
    "pulls loose from the fat like chicken skin.)",
    "Because once you were almost",
    "as beautiful as Jane Wyman ...",
    "your friends all said that.",
    "Of course at the time she was",
    "married to Ronnie and you were",
    "involved with the ASU\u2014",
    "a McCarthy suspect.",
    "Forget about your neck.",
    "They can\u2019t do that yet.",
    "A face-lift lasts five years.",
    "So you could go on being a member",
    "of new-speak and re-entry\u2014",
    "with the unsung benefits",
    "of radiation and by then",
    "your roof would have rotted anyway.",
    "Or been recycled by some corporate kid.",
    "But think how you\u2019d rather",
    "be stripped and streaked",
    "and while you\u2019re about it",
    "get some implants of baby teeth buds",
    "that they\u2019ve taken from dead babies\u2019 gums",
    "and frozen for this sort of thing.",
    "You could still die young."

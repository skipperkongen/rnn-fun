    "Waiting for your ride in front of the house",
    "where you spent the night,",
    "where, as a third ear",
    "during their endless intimate,",
    "important, and kinky phone calls,",
    "you pretended to rinse glassware;",
    "you were a dog from the pound,",
    "grateful, sniffing the upholstery.",
    "Later, lying in the center of their",
    "king-sized bed, a giant wall-to-wall",
    "mirror, isolating you like a rabbit;",
    "it was also their exercise",
    "room with torture equipment;",
    "something in you twitched;",
    "flickering a bizarre video in your head.",
    "It\u2019s morning now. You\u2019re standing",
    "outside, with nightgown and toothbrush",
    "wrapped in your purse, waiting for a bus",
    "to take you somewhere else. You\u2019re depressed.",
    "They\u2019re asleep of course. Their network wrapped",
    "around them. You keep wondering why you\u2019re",
    "missing something. Then you look back and see",
    "your pricked-up ears, your waggy self, stuck",
    "inside their picture window, where for years",
    "it will wave at you\u2014naive, apologetic, embarrassed."

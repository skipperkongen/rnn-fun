    "In the longer view it doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "However, it\u2019s that having lived, it matters.",
    "So that every death breaks you apart.",
    "You find yourself weeping at the door",
    "of your own kitchen, overwhelmed",
    "by loss. And you find yourself weeping",
    "as you pass the homeless person",
    "head in hands resigned on a cement",
    "step, the wire basket on wheels right there.",
    "Like stopped film, or a line of Vallejo,",
    "or a sketch of the mechanics of a wing",
    "by Leonardo. All pauses in space,",
    "a violent compression of meaning",
    "in an instant within the meaningless.",
    "Even staring into the dim shapes",
    "at the farthest edge; accepting that blur."

    "Pawnbroker, scavenger, cheapskate,",
    "come creeping from your pigeon-filled backrooms,",
    "past guns and clocks and locks and cages,",
    "past pockets emptied and coins picked from the floor;",
    "come sweeping with the rainclouds down the river",
    "through the brokenblack windows of factories",
    "to avenues where movies whisk through basement projectors",
    "and children peel up into the supplejack twilight\u2014",
    "there a black-eyed straight-backed drag queen",
    "preens, fusses, fixes her hair in a shop window on Prince,",
    "a young businessman jingles his change",
    "and does his Travis Bickle for a long-faced friend,",
    "there on the corner I laughed at a joke Jim made.",
    "In the bedroom the moon is a dented spoon,",
    "cold, getting colder, so hurry sleep,",
    "come creep into bed, let\u2019s get it over with;",
    "lay me down and close my eyes",
    "and tell me whip, tell me winnow",
    "tell me sweet tell me skittish",
    "tell me No tell me no such thing",
    "tell me straw into gold tell me crept into fire",
    "tell me lost all my money tell me",
    ",",
    ",",
    "but promise tomorrow I will be profligate,",
    "stepping into the sun like a trophy."

    "1",
    "Adrift in the middle of my years, I sit in a corner and drink. I eavesdrop",
    "a tableful of girls romancing their cell phones, workshopping",
    "love\u2019s abstract particulars,",
    "while football plays on the big screen;",
    "I listen like a thief in case the women know the score.",
    "But I never could tell. At fulltime I walk home like a motherless child.",
    "2",
    "Witness is a solitary game. There isn\u2019t a thing I have left to say",
    "but back in my room I ring like a singing bowl,",
    "empty and unable to stop.",
    "You\u2019re in nine kinds of pain, my friend; you know",
    "the twenty-seven strains of despair. And your lovely hair has fallen.",
    "The moon at my window is a rusted shot, caught in its corrupt trajectory down.",
    "3",
    "The world was always someone else\u2019s oyster, a metaphor",
    "I never could prise open.",
    "All I\u2019m good for tonight",
    "is to let the night pass,",
    "while beyond me the world peters and my friend fights beautifully",
    "like a trout on god\u2019s line. The usual idiots are still in power. But they\u2019ll keep."

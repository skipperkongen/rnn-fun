    "on the studio window. A crow looks in,",
    "hopping and shrieking when I dance",
    "in my black tutu, trimmed with silver.",
    "The ballet master says,",
    "But in a crow\u2019s sky-knowing mind",
    "could I be so misconstrued?",
    "Out of the blackest",
    "cold-wet air, the crow seems molded.",
    "The stars will not wake up to guide it",
    "back to the creek of shadows",
    "where it was formed. Practice, practice.",
    "I am smoke in darkness, climbing away",
    "from a burning hut, in an otherwise empty field",
    "on which the fire is slight and low,",
    "and the rest of it is snow."

    "Remember when you love, from that same hour",
    "Your peace you put into your lover\u2019s power;",
    "From that same hour from him you laws receive,",
    "And as he shall ordain, you joy, or grieve,",
    "Hope, fear, laugh, weep; Reason aloof does stand,",
    "Disabled both to act, and to command.",
    "Oh cruel fetters! rather wish to feel",
    "On your soft limbs, the galling weight of steel;",
    "Rather to bloody wounds oppose your breast.",
    "No ill, by which the body can be pressed",
    "You will so sensible a torment find",
    "As shackles on your captived mind.",
    "The mind from heaven its high descent did draw,",
    "And brooks uneasily any other law",
    "Than what from Reason dictated shall be.",
    "Reason, a kind of innate deity,",
    "Which only can adapt to ev\u2019ry soul",
    "A yoke so fit and light, that the control",
    "All liberty excels; so sweet a sway,",
    "The same \u2019tis to be happy, and obey;",
    "Commands so wise, and with rewards so dressed,",
    "That the according soul replies \u201cI\u2019m blessed.\u201d"

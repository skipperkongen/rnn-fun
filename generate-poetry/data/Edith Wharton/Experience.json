    "I",
    "Like Crusoe with the bootless gold we stand",
    "Upon the desert verge of death, and say:",
    "\u201cWhat shall avail the woes of yesterday",
    "To buy to-morrow\u2019s wisdom, in the land",
    "Whose currency is strange unto our hand?",
    "In life\u2019s small market they had served to pay",
    "Some late-found rapture, could we but delay",
    "Till Time hath matched our means to our demand.\u201d",
    "But otherwise Fate wills it, for, behold,",
    "Our gathered strength of individual pain,",
    "When Time\u2019s long alchemy hath made it gold,",
    "Dies with us\u2014hoarded all these years in vain,",
    "Since those that might be heir to it the mould",
    "Renew, and coin themselves new griefs again.",
    "II",
    "O Death, we come full-handed to thy gate,",
    "Rich with strange burden of the mingled years,",
    "Gains and renunciations, mirth and tears,",
    "And love\u2019s oblivion, and remembering hate,",
    "Nor know we what compulsion laid such freight",
    "Upon our souls\u2014and shall our hopes and fears",
    "Buy nothing of thee, Death? Behold our wares,",
    "And sell us the one joy for which we wait.",
    "Had we lived longer, like had such for sale,",
    "With the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap,",
    "But now we stand before thy shadowy pale,",
    "And all our longings lie within thy keep\u2014",
    "Death, can it be the years shall naught avail?",
    "\u201cNot so,\u201d Death answered, \u201cthey shall purchase sleep.\u201d"

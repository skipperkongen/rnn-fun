    "Turn again, turn again,",

    "Bright wooden waves of people creak",

    "Of heat; Dean Pasppus\u2019 long nose snores",
    "Harsh as a hautbois, marshy-weak.",
    "The wooden waves of people creak",
    "Through the fields all water-sleek.",
    "And in among the straws of light",
    "Those bumpkin hautbois-sounds take flight.",
    "Whence he lies snoring like the moon",
    "Clownish-white all afternoon.",
    "Beneath the trees\u2019 arsenical",
    "Sharp woodwind tunes; heretical\u2014",
    "Blown like the wind\u2019s mane",
    "(Creaking woodenly again).",
    "His wandering thoughts escape like geese",
    "Till he, their gooseherd, sets up chase,",
    "And clouds of wool join the bright race",
    "For scattered old simplicities."

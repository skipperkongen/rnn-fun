    "The showman\u2019s face is cubed clear as",

    "Of water\u2014(glog, glut, a ghost\u2019s speech",
    "Fumbling for space from each to each).",

    "I do not care if men should throw",
    "Round sun and moon to make me go\u2014",
    "As bright as gold and silver pence . . .",
    "They cannot drive their black shade hence!"

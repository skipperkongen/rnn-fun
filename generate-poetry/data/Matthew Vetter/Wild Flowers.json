    "At fifty-six, having left my mother,",
    "my father buys a motorcycle.",
    "I imagine him because",
    "it is the son\u2019s sorrowful assignment",
    "to imagine his father: there,",
    "hunched on his mount,",
    "with black boots, with bad teeth,",
    "between shifts at the mill,",
    "ripping furrows in the backroads,",
    "past barn and field and silo,",
    "past creek and rock,",
    "past the brown mare,",
    "sleek in her impertinence,",
    "never slowing until he sees",
    "the bull. He stops, pulls",
    "his bike to the side of the road,",
    "where golden rod and clover grow,",
    "walks up to the fence, admires",
    "its horns, its wet snout snorting and blowing",
    "its breath, its girth, its trampling",
    "of small wild flowers."

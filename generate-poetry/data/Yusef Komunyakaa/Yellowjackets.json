    "Against dusk, tethered to somebody\u2019s",
    "Pocketwatch. He shivered, but not",
    "The way women shook their heads",
    "Before mirrors at the five",
    "& dime\u2014a deeper connection",
    "To the low field\u2019s evening star.",
    "He stood there, in tracechains,",
    "Lathered in froth, just",
    "Stopped by a great, goofy",
    "Calmness. He whinnied",
    "Once, & then the whole",
    "Beautiful, blue-black sky",
    "Fell on his back."

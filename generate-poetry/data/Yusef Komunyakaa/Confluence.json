    "I\u2019ve been here before, dreaming myself",
    "backwards, among grappling hooks of light.",
    "True to the seasons, I\u2019ve lived every word",
    "spoken. Did I walk into someone\u2019s nightmare?",
    "Hunger quivers on a fleshly string",
    "at the crossroad. So deep is the lore,",
    "there\u2019s only tomorrow today where darkness",
    "splinters & wounds the bird of paradise.",
    "On paths that plunge into primordial",
    "green, Echo\u2019s laughter finds us together.",
    "In the sweatshops of desire men think",
    "if they don\u2019t die the moon won\u2019t rise.",
    "All the dead-end streets run into one",
    "moment of bliss & sleight of hand.",
    "Beside the Euphrates, past the Tigris,",
    "up the Mississippi. Bloodline & clockwork.",
    "The X drawn where we stand. Trains",
    "follow rivers that curve around us.",
    "The distant night opens like a pearl",
    "fan, a skirt, a heart, a drop of salt.",
    "When we embrace, we are not an island",
    "beyond fables & the blue exhaust of commerce.",
    "When the sounds of River Styx punish",
    "trees, my effigy speaks to the night owl.",
    "Our voices break open the pink magnolia",
    "where struggle is home to the beast in us.",
    "All the senses tuned for the Hawkesbury,",
    "labyrinths turning into lowland fog.",
    "Hand in hand, feeling good, we walk",
    "phantoms from the floating machine.",
    "When a drowning man calls out,",
    "his voice follows him downstream."

    "If you're one of seven",
    "Downfalls, up in your kingdom",
    "Of mulberry leaves, there are men",
    "Betting you aren't worth a bullet,",
    "That your skin won't tan into a good",
    "Wallet. As if drugged in the womb",
    "& limboed in a honeyed languor,",
    "By the time you open your eyes",
    "A thousand species have lived",
    "& died. Born on a Sunday",
    "Morning, with old-world algae",
    "In your long hair, a goodness",
    "Disguised your two-toed claws",
    "Bright as flensing knives. In this",
    "Upside-down haven, you're reincarnated",
    "As a fallen angel trying to go home."

    "We tied branches to our helmets.",
    "We painted our faces & rifles",
    "with mud from a riverbank,",
    "blades of grass hung from the pockets",
    "of our tiger suits. We wove",
    "ourselves into the terrain,",
    "content to be a hummingbird\u2019s target.",
    "We hugged bamboo & leaned",
    "against a breeze off the river,",
    "slow-dragging with ghosts",
    "from Saigon to Bangkok,",
    "with women left in doorways",
    "reaching in from America.",
    "We aimed at dark-hearted songbirds.",
    "In our way station of shadows",
    "rock apes tried to blow our cover,",
    "throwing stones at the sunset. Chameleons",
    "crawled our spines, changing from day",
    "to night: green to gold,",
    "gold to black. But we waited",
    "till the moon touched metal,",
    "till something almost broke",
    "inside us. VC struggled",
    "with the hillside, like black silk",
    "wrestling iron through grass.",
    "We weren\u2019t there. The river ran",
    "through our bones. Small animals took refuge",
    "against our bodies; we held our breath,",
    "ready to spring the L-shaped",
    "ambush, as a world revolved",
    "under each man\u2019s eyelid."

    "I went into the forest searching",
    "for fire inside pleading wood,",
    "but I can\u2019t say for how long",
    "I was moored between worlds.",
    "I heard a magpie\u2019s rumination,",
    "but I don\u2019t know if its wings",
    "lifted the moon or let it drift",
    "slow as a little straw boat",
    "set ablaze on a winding river.",
    "I learned the yellow-eyed wolf",
    "is a dog",
    "a man. A small boy",
    "with a star pinned to his sleeve",
    "was hiding among thorn bushes,",
    "or it was how the restless dark",
    "wounded the pale linden tree",
    "outside a Warsaw apartment.",
    "Night crawls under each stone",
    "quick as a cry held in the throat.",
    "All I remember is my left hand",
    "was holding your right breast",
    "when I forced my eyes shut.",
    "Then I could hear something",
    "in the room, magnanimous",
    "but small, half outside",
    "half",
    "inside, no more than a song\u2014",
    "an insomniac\u2019s one prophecy",
    "pressed against the curtains,",
    "forcing the ferns to bloom."

    "I\u2019ve come to this one grassy hill",
    "in Ramallah, off Tokyo Street,",
    "to place a few red anemones",
    "& a sheaf of wheat on Darwish\u2019s grave.",
    "A borrowed line transported me beneath",
    "a Babylonian moon & I found myself",
    "lucky to have the shadow of a coat",
    "as warmth, listening to a poet\u2019s song",
    "of Jerusalem, the hum of a red string",
    "Caesar stole off Gilgamesh\u2019s lute.",
    "I know a prison of sunlight on the skin.",
    "The land I come from they also dreamt",
    "before they arrived in towering ships",
    "battered by the hard Atlantic winds.",
    "Crows followed me from my home.",
    "My coyote heart is an old runagate",
    "redskin, a noble savage, still Lakota,",
    "& I knew the bow before the arch.",
    "I feel the wildflowers, all the grasses",
    "& insects singing to me. My sacred dead",
    "is the dust of restless plains I come from,",
    "& I love when it gets into my eyes & mouth",
    "telling me of the roads behind & ahead.",
    "I go back to broken treaties & smallpox,",
    "the irony of barbed wire. Your envoy",
    "could be a reprobate whose inheritance",
    "is no more than a swig of firewater.",
    "The sun made a temple of the bones",
    "of my tribe. I know a dried-up riverbed",
    "& extinct animals live in your nightmares",
    "sharp as shark teeth from my mountains",
    "strung into this brave necklace around",
    "my neck. I hear Chief Standing Bear",
    "saying to Judge Dundy, \u201cI am a man,\u201d",
    "& now I know why I\u2019d rather die a poet",
    "than a warrior, tattoo & tomahawk."

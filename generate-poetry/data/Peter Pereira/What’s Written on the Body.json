    "He will not light long enough",
    "for the interpreter to gather",
    "the tatters of his speech.",
    "But the longer we listen",
    "the calmer he becomes.",
    "He shows me the place where his daughter",
    "has rubbed with a coin, violaceous streaks",
    "raising a skeletal pattern on his chest.",
    "He\u2019s worried it will become pneumonia.",
    "In Cambodia, he\u2019d be given",
    "a special tea, a prescriptive sacrifice,",
    "the right chants to say. But I",
    "know nothing of Chi, of Karma,",
    "and ask him to lift the back of his shirt,",
    "so I may listen to his breathing.",
    "Holding the stethoscope\u2019s bell I\u2019m stunned",
    "by the whirl of icons and script",
    "tattooed across his back, their teal green color",
    "the outline of a map which looks",
    "like Cambodia, perhaps his village, a lake,",
    "then a scroll of letters in a watery signature.",
    "I ask the interpreter what it means.",
    "to protect him from evil spirits\u2014",
    "she is tracing the lines with her fingers\u2014",
    "The old man waves his arms and a staccato",
    "of diphthongs and nasals fills the room.",
    "back to Cambodia after he dies.",
    "I see, I say, and rest my hand on his shoulder.",
    "He takes full deep breaths and I listen,",
    "touching down with the stethoscope",
    "from his back to his front. He watches me",
    "with anticipation\u2014as if awaiting a verdict.",
    "His lungs are clear.",
    "I tell him.",
    "His shoulders relax and he folds his hands",
    "above his head as if in blessing.",
    "he says."

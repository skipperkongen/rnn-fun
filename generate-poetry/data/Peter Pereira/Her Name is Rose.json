    "With a boil the size of an egg",
    "protruding from her right hip,",
    "she knows what I must do,",
    "and to stall me has locked herself",
    "inside the bathroom, bargaining",
    "for a way out.",
    "But it\u2019s too late: I\u2019ve seen",
    "the oozing wounds stopped up with bits",
    "of toilet paper and tape, the scarified",
    "pockets that crater the surface",
    "of her arms, buttocks, thighs.",
    "A mean fix torched her last vein",
    "years ago, and she\u2019s been banging the dope",
    "ever since, puncturing her body",
    "like a juju doll. She wants to kick,",
    "but not now.",
    "she says",
    "in a velvet voice. I already know what she\u2019s after:",
    "something stronger than local, a few Percocet, a shot of Demerol",
    "before she\u2019ll let me begin.",
    "All I can tell you is, when the abscess finally drains",
    "the odor is so foul it\u2019s evil.",
    "And I\u2019m not sure, driving home",
    "later that night, still smelling the pallid citrus,",
    "whether it\u2019s merely hallucination, the way",
    "her memory inhabits me; or if being",
    "in that same room, inhaling",
    "that same air, made some of her",
    "part of me.",
    "And whose veins",
    "are these, beginning to twitch?"

    "What justifies the inequality",
    "That issues her a tastefully square-cut",
    "Ruby for her finger, him a suit",
    "Whose rumpled, unemphatic dignity",
    "Declares a life of working sitting down,",
    "While someone in a sweatshop has to squint",
    "And palsy sewing, and a continent",
    "Sheds blood to pry the gemstone from the ground,",
    "Could not be justice. Nothing but the use",
    "To which they put prosperity can speak",
    "In their defense: the faces money makes,",
    "They demonstrate, don\u2019t have to be obtuse,",
    "Entitled, vapid, arrogantly strong;",
    "Only among the burghers do you find",
    "A glance so frank, engaging, and refined,",
    "So tentative, so conscious of its wrong."

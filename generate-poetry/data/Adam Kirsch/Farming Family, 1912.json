    "\"Farming Family, 1912,\" by August Sander",
    "The cruelty of the men when they\u2019re alone,",
    "The women\u2019s tiredness and resignation,",
    "Do not get multiplied, as you\u2019d expect,",
    "When the extended families collect,",
    "One day a year, to get their pictures taken.",
    "It\u2019s not that any of their faces soften,",
    "Nor that there\u2019s any obvious affection",
    "Between the farmer\u2019s mother and his son;",
    "And only an idealist could see",
    "In this brief cutting from the family tree",
    "A symbol of the strength of rootedness\u2014",
    "Three generations dwelling in one place\u2014",
    "Knowing how soon the root will lose its branch,",
    "Cut down and hacked to pieces in a trench.",
    "The only explanation that makes sense",
    "For the illusion of resilience",
    "That lights their eyes and makes them look at home",
    "Is that with every added generation",
    "Buried potentialities appear:",
    "The son who poses strumming his guitar",
    "Refutes his father\u2019s brandished Iron Cross",
    "No more convincingly than his bare face",
    "Proves that his father\u2019s beard is obsolete;",
    "Denying one another, they complete",
    "Their likeness to the contradictory",
    "God who commanded us to multiply",
    "So He could manifest, in every birth,",
    "Another of His attributes on earth."

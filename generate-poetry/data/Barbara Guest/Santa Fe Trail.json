    "I go separately",
    "The sweet knees of oxen have pressed a path for me",
    "ghosts with ingots have burned their bare hands",
    "it is the dungaree darkness with China stitched",
    "where the westerly winds",
    "and the traveler\u2019s checks",
    "the evensong of salesmen",
    "the glistening paraphernalia of twin suitcases",
    "where no one speaks English.",
    "I go separately",
    "It is the wind, the rubber wind",
    "when we brush our teeth in the way station",
    "a climate to beard. What forks these roads?",
    "Who clammers o\u2019er the twain?",
    "What murmurs and rustles in the distance",
    "in the white branches where the light is whipped",
    "piercing at the crossing as into the dunes we simmer",
    "and toss ourselves awhile the motor pants like a forest",
    "where owls from their bandaged eyes send messages",
    "to the Indian couple. Peaks have you heard?",
    "I go separately",
    "We have reached the arithmetics, are partially quenched",
    "while it growls and hints in the lost trapper\u2019s voice",
    "She is coming toward us like a session of pines",
    "in the wild wooden air where rabbits are frozen,",
    "O mother of lakes and glaciers, save us gamblers",
    "whose wagon is perilously rapt."

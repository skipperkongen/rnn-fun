    "Only the casket left, the jewel gone",
    "Whose noble presence filled these stately rooms,",
    "And made this spot a shrine where pilgrims came\u2014",
    "Stranger and friend\u2014to bend in reverence",
    "Before the great, pure soul that knew no guile;",
    "To listen to the wise and gracious words",
    "That fell from lips whose rare, exquisite smile",
    "Gave tender beauty to the grand, grave face.",
    "Upon these pictured walls we see thy peers,\u2014",
    "Poet, and saint, and sage, painter, and king,\u2014",
    "A glorious band;\u2014they shine upon us still;",
    "Still gleam in marble the enchanting forms",
    "Whereupon thy artist eye delighted dwelt;",
    "Thy favorite Psyche droops her matchless face,",
    "Listening, methinks, for the beloved voice",
    "Which nevermore on earth shall sound her praise.",
    "All these remain,\u2014the beautiful, the brave,",
    "The gifted, silent ones; but thou art gone!",
    "Fair is the world that smiles upon us now;",
    "Blue are the skies of June, balmy the air",
    "That soothes with touches soft the weary brow;",
    "And perfect days glide into perfect nights,\u2014",
    "Moonlit and calm; but still our grateful hearts",
    "Are sad, and faint with fear,\u2014 for thou art gone!",
    "Oh friend beloved, with longing, tear-filled eyes",
    "We look up, up to the unclouded blue,",
    "And seek in vain some answering sign from thee.",
    "Look down upon us, guide and cheer us still",
    "From the serene height where thou dwellest now;",
    "Dark is the way without the beacon light",
    "Which long and steadfastly thy hand upheld.",
    "Oh, nerve with courage new the stricken hearts",
    "Whose dearest hopes seem lost in losing thee."

    "They\u2019ve perched for hours",
    "on that window-ledge, scarcely",
    "moving. Beak to beak,",
    "a matched set, they differ",
    "almost imperceptibly\u2014",
    "like salt and pepper shakers.",
    "It\u2019s an event when they tuck",
    "(simultaneously) their pinpoint",
    "heads into lavender vests",
    "of fat. But reminiscent",
    "of clock hands blandly",
    "turning because they must",
    "have turned\u2014somehow, they\u2019ve",
    "taken on the grave,",
    "small-eyed aspect of monks",
    "hooded in conferences",
    "so intimate nothing need",
    "be said. If some are chuckling",
    "in the park, earning",
    "their bread, these are content",
    "to let the dark engulf them\u2014",
    "it\u2019s all the human",
    "imagination can fathom,",
    "how single-mindedly",
    "mindless two silhouettes",
    "stand in a window thick",
    "as milk glass. They appear",
    "never to have fed on",
    "anything else when they stir",
    "all of a sudden to peck",
    "savagely, for love",
    "or hygiene, at the grimy",
    "feathers of the other;",
    "but when they resume",
    "their places, the shift",
    "is one only a painter",
    "or a barber (prodding a chin",
    "back into position)",
    "would be likely to notice."

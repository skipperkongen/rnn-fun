    "The sun rose over the sweep of the hill",
    "All bare for the gathered hay,",
    "And a blackbird sang by the window-sill,",
    "And a girl knelt down to pray:",
    "\u2018Whom Thou hast kept through the night, O Lord,",
    "Keep Thou safe through the day.\u2019",
    "The sun rose over the shell-swept height,",
    "The guns are over the way,",
    "And a soldier turned from the toil of the night",
    "To the toil of another day,",
    "And a bullet sang by the parapet",
    "To drive in the new-turned clay.",
    "The sun sank slow by the sweep of the hill,",
    "They had carried all the hay,",
    "And a blackbird sang by the window-sill,",
    "And a girl knelt down to pray:",
    "\u2018Keep Thou safe through the night, O Lord,",
    "Whom Thou hast kept through the day.\u2019",
    "The sun sank slow by the shell-swept height,",
    "The guns had prepared a way,",
    "And a soldier turned to sleep that night",
    "Who would not wake for the day,",
    "And a blackbird flew from the window-sill,",
    "When a girl knelt down to pray."

    "The gregarious dark is shifting",
    "when she puts her second drink,",
    "the free one, half on the coaster.",
    "The tipped wine poised at the brim",
    "is the beginning of the bad girl",
    "she\u2019ll promise never to be again",
    "tomorrow, who can taunt him now",
    "to prove he doesn\u2019t love her",
    "and never could: her hand slides",
    "up his thigh until he tenses\u2014",
    "\u2018My little prig, don\u2019t you want",
    "to fuck me?\u2019 the bad girl",
    "she couldn\u2019t be at home, his wife on ice.",
    "All he can do is smile back",
    "as though she\u2019s made a harmless",
    "good-natured joke, and struggle",
    "not to look around to see",
    "who\u2019s heard, who\u2019s watching. He wants",
    "to smash the wine glass in her face",
    "so he can know for once",
    "exactly what he\u2019s done wrong;",
    "but he places it instead",
    "back safely on the coaster",
    "quickly before she sees.",
    "Never cautious enough, he is prepared",
    "even if she knocks it over",
    "to go down on his hands and knees",
    "and wipe it up, kind and forgiving.",
    "In all ways careful to acquit himself",
    "so that tomorrow when she says",
    "she doesn\u2019t deserve him, he\u2019s too good,",
    "he can believe her. Tomorrow",
    "will be",
    "happy hour. There won\u2019t be",
    "anything she wouldn\u2019t do for him."

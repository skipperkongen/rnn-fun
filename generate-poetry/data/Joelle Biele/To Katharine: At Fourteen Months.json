    "All morning, you\u2019ve studied the laws",
    "of spoons, the rules of books, the dynamics",
    "of the occasional plate, observed the principles",
    "governing objects in motion and objects",
    "at rest. To see if it will fall, and if it does,",
    "how far, if it will rage like a lost penny",
    "or ring like a Chinese gong\u2014because",
    "it doesn\u2019t have to\u2014you lean from your chair",
    "and hold your cup over the floor.",
    "It curves in your hand, it weighs in your palm,",
    "it arches like a wave, it is a dipper",
    "full of stars, and you\u2019re the wind timing",
    "the pull of the moon, you\u2019re the water",
    "measuring the distance from which we fall."

    "The first person in recorded history",
    "struck by a comet slept on her couch",
    "across the road from the Comet Drive-In",
    "and the comet found her roof, her sadness, her knee,",
    "and woke her. Everything that hurts",
    "hurt before, she said. Showing at the drive-in, a documentary",
    "on tightrope-walking: a young man frustrated",
    "that his dream, the World Trade Center, was not yet built",
    "so he practiced for years in a meadow crossing intended sky, intent",
    "like a pillowcase sweetening him, no harm . . . Here",
    "let the towers go, let them write his crossing, cursive, back and forth",
    "his name steadying our tongues . . . Famous, overcoat",
    "floating down without him, the idea that we stand",
    "where we mean to stand, 1974, a distraction",
    "from my parents\u2019 morning commute. At 59th Street they split.",
    "The poems I was writing were no longer poems of their divorce,",
    "my father\u2019s sweeping gestures or his pain, the old Volkswagen",
    "and garden hose\u2014all of that had washed from my poems",
    "and instead an imaginary family arrived in borrowed gardens,",
    "their son stillborn\u2014even as I grew heavy with my own son",
    "I wrote poem after poem holding this imagined horror close."

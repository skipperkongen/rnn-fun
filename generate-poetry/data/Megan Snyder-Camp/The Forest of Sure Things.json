    "In this land the children tear their hearts in half.",
    "Let me explain. If ten things are wanted, only ten",
    "can be had. If a stand of birches is found to be made of tin,",
    "the soil around them will bleed with rust. In this land children",
    "study their magazines in broad daylight, and in their books",
    "any soldier who stumbles will not fall. No one will fall,",
    "a gift parents try not to make much of. At every meal",
    "some is set aside. In every garden a patch lies fallow. At parties",
    "there are whispers of illegal cheeses. Camembert, especially,",
    "is said to taste",
    "And so the children learn",
    "to make room. To leave some.",
    "Nothing will come, but nothing will go.",
    "To love like this half must rattle in its pit."

    "Each morning we begin again. My wife",
    "wakes me with a shove, and condescends to try",
    "her sorry Deutsch with me; she\u2019s chewing mud.",
    "God, she\u2019s dumb. I tell her so, but mostly",
    "in a dialect she never understands.",
    "Carefully now, she mouths her thanks and takes me",
    "by the hand to the dampness of the trough,",
    "where she leaves me throwing water on my face.",
    "I wash those parts I want to wash, begin",
    "my bump along the wall to the sour kitchen,",
    "where coffee waits and something tasteless chills",
    "against the plate. Grace is blind, and probably",
    "deaf as well, happens only where angels",
    "let it\u2014nowhere you\u2019ll ever find in time.",
    "I\u2019ve never seen the woman\u2019s face, though once,",
    "too far from here to count for much, I wished I could.",
    "But it\u2019s morning come again, and she,",
    "as is her habit, begins to sing above the soup.",
    "Somewhere, some angel pities me, as God",
    "must once have pitied her: Her voice forgets",
    "its tenement, and I neglect the words."

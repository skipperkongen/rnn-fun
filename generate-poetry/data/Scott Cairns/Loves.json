    "Of Love\u2019s discrete occasions, we",
    "observe sufficient catalogue,",
    "a likely-sounding lexicon",
    "pronounced so as to implicate",
    "a wealth of difference, where reclines",
    "instead a common element,",
    "itself quite like those elements",
    "partaken at the table served",
    "by Jesus on the night he was",
    "betrayed\u2014like those in that the bread",
    "was breakable, the wine was red",
    "and wet, and met the tongue with bright,",
    "intoxicating sweetness, quite",

    "to compromise that sacrament,",
    "the mystery of spirit graved",
    "in what is commonplace and plain\u2014",

    "Quite otherwise, I choose instead",
    "to bear again the news that each,",
    "each was still",
    ", substantial",
    "in the simplest sense. By now, you",
    "will have learned of Magdalen, a name",
    "recalled for having won a touch",
    "of favor from the one we call",
    "the son of man, and what you\u2019ve heard",
    "is true enough. I met him first",
    "as, mute, he scribbled in the dust",
    "to shame some village hypocrites",
    "toward leaving me unbloodied,",
    "if ill-disposed to taking up",
    "again a prior circumstance.",
    "I met him in the house of one",
    "who was a Pharisee and not",
    "prepared to suffer quietly",
    "my handling of the master\u2019s feet.",
    "Much later, in the garden when,",
    "having died and risen, he spoke",
    "as to a maid and asked me why",
    "I wept. When, at",
    "meeting",
    "with the Christ, was I not weeping?",
    "For what? I only speculate",
    "\u2014brief inability to speak,",
    "a weak and giddy troubling near",

    "And early on, I think, some slight",
    "abiding sense of shame, a sop",

    "to do without. Lush poverty!",

    "the new temptation\u2014dangerous,",
    "inexpedient mask\u2014of shame.",
    "And, well, perhaps one other thing:",
    "I have received some little bit",
    "about the glib divisions which",
    "so lately have occurred to you",
    "as right, as necessary, fit",
    "That the body is something less",
    "than honorable, say, in its",

    "something pure, and\u2014if all goes well\u2014",
    "potentially unencumbered",
    "by the body\u2019s bawdy tastes.",
    "This disposition, then, has led",
    "to a banal and pious lack",
    "of charity, and, worse, has led",
    "more than a few to attempt some",

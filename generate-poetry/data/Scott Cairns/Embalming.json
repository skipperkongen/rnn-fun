    "You\u2019ll need a corpse, your own or someone else\u2019s.",
    "You\u2019ll need a certain distance; the less you care about",
    "your corpse the better. Light should be",
    "unforgiving, so as to lend a literal",
    "aspect to your project. Flesh should be putty,",
    "each hair of the brows, each lash, a pencil mark.",
    "If the skeleton is intact, its shape may",
    "suggest beginnings of a structure, though even here",
    "modification might occur; heavier",
    "tools are waiting in the drawer, as well as wire,",
    "varied lengths and thicknesses of doweling.",
    "Odd hollows may be filled with bundled towel.",
    "As for the fluids, arrange them on the cart",
    "in a pleasing manner. I prefer we speak",
    "of",
    ". This notion of one\u2019s anointing",
    "will help distract you from a simpler story",
    "of your handiwork. Those people in the parlor",
    "made requests, remember? Don\u2019t be concerned.",
    "Whatever this was to them, it is all yours now.",
    "The clay of your creation lies before you,",
    "invites your hand. Becoming anxious? That\u2019s good.",
    "You should be a little anxious. You\u2019re ready.",
    "Hold the knife as you would a quill, hardly at all.",
    "See that first line before you cross it, and draw."

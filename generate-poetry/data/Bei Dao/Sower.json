    "a sower walks into the great hall",
    "it's war out there, he says",

    "I've come in the name of fields",
    "it's war out there",
    "I walk out from that great hall",
    "all four directions a boundless harvest scene",
    "I start planning for war",
    "rehearsing death",
    "and the crops I burn",
    "send up the wolf-smoke of warning fires",
    "but something haunts me furiously:",
    "he's sowing seed across marble floors"

    "I\u2019m wondering where you are now",
    "Married, or mad, or free:",

    "But memory troubles me.",
    "We could\u2019ve had us children,",
    "We could\u2019ve had a home\u2014",
    "But you thought not, and I thought not,",
    "And these nine years we roam.",
    "Today I worked in the deep dark tanks,",
    "And climbed out to watch the sea:",
    "Gulls and salty waves pass by,",
    "And mountains of Araby.",
    "I\u2019ve travelled the lonely oceans",
    "And wandered the lonely towns.",
    "I\u2019ve learned a lot and lost a lot,",
    "And proved the world was round.",
    "Now if we\u2019d stayed together,",
    "There\u2019s much we\u2019d never\u2019ve known\u2014",
    "But dreary books and weary lands",
    "Weigh on me like a stone.",
    "Indian Ocean, 1959"

    "A few light flakes of snow",
    "Fall in the feeble sun;",
    "Birds sing in the cold,",
    "A warbler by the wall. The plum",
    "Buds tight and chill soon bloom.",
    "The moon begins first",
    "Fourth, a faint slice west",
    "At nightfall. Jupiter half-way",
    "High at the end of night-",
    "Meditation. The dove cry",
    "Twangs like a bow.",
    "At dawn Mt. Hiei dusted white",
    "On top; in the clear air",
    "Folds of all the gullied green",
    "Hills around the town are sharp,",
    "Breath stings. Beneath the roofs",
    "Of frosty houses",
    "Lovers part, from tangle warm",
    "Of gentle bodies under quilt",
    "And crack the icy water to the face",
    "And wake and feed the children",
    "And grandchildren that they love."

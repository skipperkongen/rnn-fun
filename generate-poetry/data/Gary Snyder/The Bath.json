    "Washing Kai in the sauna,",
    "The kerosene lantern set on a box",
    "outside the ground-level window,",
    "Lights up the edge of the iron stove and the",
    "washtub down on the slab",
    "Steaming air and crackle of waterdrops",
    "brushed by on the pile of rocks on top",
    "He stands in warm water",
    "Soap all over the smooth of his thigh and stomach",
    "\u201cGary don\u2019t soap my hair!\u201d",
    "\u2014his eye-sting fear\u2014",
    "the soapy hand feeling",
    "through and around the globes and curves of his body",
    "up in the crotch,",
    "And washing-tickling out the scrotum, little anus,",
    "his penis curving up and getting hard",
    "as I pull back skin and try to wash it",
    "Laughing and jumping, flinging arms around,",
    "I squat all naked too,",
    "Sweating and panting in the stove-steam hot-stone",
    "cedar-planking wooden bucket water-splashing",
    "kerosene lantern-flicker wind-in-the-pines-out",
    "sierra forest ridges night\u2014",
    "Masa comes in, letting fresh cool air",
    "sweep down from the door",
    "a deep sweet breath",
    "And she tips him over gripping neatly, one knee down",
    "her hair falling hiding one whole side of",
    "shoulder, breast, and belly,",
    "Washes deftly Kai\u2019s head-hair",
    "as he gets mad and yells\u2014",
    "The body of my lady, the winding valley spine,",
    "the space between the thighs I reach through,",
    "cup her curving vulva arch and hold it from behind,",
    "a soapy tickle a hand of grail",
    "The gates of Awe",
    "That open back a turning double-mirror world of",
    "wombs in wombs, in rings,",
    "that start in music,",
    "The hidden place of seed",
    "The veins net flow across the ribs, that gathers",
    "milk and peaks up in a nipple\u2014fits",
    "our mouth\u2014",
    "The sucking milk from this our body sends through",
    "jolts of light; the son, the father,",
    "sharing mother\u2019s joy",
    "That brings a softness to the flower of the awesome",
    "open curling lotus gate I cup and kiss",
    "As Kai laughs at his mother\u2019s breast he now is weaned",
    "from, we",
    "wash each other,",
    "Kai\u2019s little scrotum up close to his groin,",
    "the seed still tucked away, that moved from us to him",
    "In flows that lifted with the same joys forces",
    "as his nursing Masa later,",
    "playing with her breast,",
    "Or me within her,",
    "Or him emerging,",
    "Clean, and rinsed, and sweating more, we stretch",
    "out on the redwood benches hearts all beating",
    "Quiet to the simmer of the stove,",
    "the scent of cedar",
    "And then turn over,",
    "murmuring gossip of the grasses,",
    "talking firewood,",
    "Wondering how Gen\u2019s napping, how to bring him in",
    "soon wash him too\u2014",
    "These boys who love their mother",
    "who loves men, who passes on",
    "her sons to other women;",
    "The cloud across the sky. The windy pines.",
    "the trickle gurgle in the swampy meadow",
    "Fire inside and boiling water on the stove",
    "We sigh and slide ourselves down from the benches",
    "wrap the babies, step outside,",
    "black night & all the stars.",
    "Pour cold water on the back and thighs",
    "Go in the house\u2014stand steaming by the center fire",
    "Kai scampers on the sheepskin",
    "Gen standing hanging on and shouting,",
    "\u201cBao! bao! bao! bao! bao!\u201d",
    "This is our body. Drawn up crosslegged by the flames",
    "drinking icy water",
    "hugging babies, kissing bellies,",
    "Laughing on the Great Earth",
    "Come out from the bath."

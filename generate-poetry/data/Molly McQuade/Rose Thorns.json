    "Why do roses need their thorns?",
    "Some things are little known.",
    "But thorns of roses",
    "spring and seize the surface",
    "of fey airs",
    "before the roses come.",
    "I\u2019ve seen thorns huddle in a harmony alone,",
    "hunkered down on green, wiry canes,",
    "smoothed blades of whipping rose stalks,",
    "and curl their polished tridents",
    "to night\u2019s call.",
    "They are like stars",
    "digging into firmament",
    "with such desire,",
    "you don\u2019t quite get it,",
    "and so healthy that",
    "they almost have to wound,",
    "or like bodies that can\u2019t be argued,",
    "borrowed, tamed.",
    "The touch of a thorn",
    "is a wry, deep telling",
    "of the senses not to bloom",
    "without a wish to,",
    "without belief in pain",
    "to hold us true."

    "A girl who, in 1971, when I was living by myself, painfully lonely, bereft, depressed,",
    "offhandedly mentioned to me in a conversation with some friends that although at first she\u2019d found me\u2014",
    "I can\u2019t remember the term, some dated colloquialism signifying odd, unacceptable, out-of-things\u2014",
    "she\u2019d decided that I was after all all right ... twelve years later she comes back to me from nowhere",
    "and I realize that it wasn\u2019t my then irrepressible, unselective, incessant sexual want she meant,",
    "which, when we\u2019d been introduced, I\u2019d naturally aimed at her and which she\u2019d easily deflected,",
    "but that she\u2019d thought I really was, in myself, the way I looked and spoke and acted,",
    "what she was saying, creepy, weird, whatever, and I am taken with a terrible humiliation."

    "If that someone who\u2019s me yet not me yet who judges me is always with me,",
    "as he is, shouldn\u2019t he have been there when I said so long ago that thing I said?",
    "If he who rakes me with such not trivial shame for minor sins now were there then,",
    "shouldn\u2019t he have warned me he\u2019d even now devastate me for my unpardonable affront?",
    "I\u2019m a child then, yet already I\u2019ve composed this conscience-beast, who harries me:",
    "is there anything else I can say with certainty about who I was, except that I, that he,",
    "could already draw from infinitesimal transgressions complex chords of remorse,",
    "and orchestrate ever undiminishing retribution from the hapless rest of myself?",

    "The son of some friends of my parents has died, and my parents, paying their call,",
    "take me along, and I\u2019m sent out with the dead boy\u2019s brother and some others to play.",
    "We\u2019re joking around, and some words come to my mind, which to my amazement are said.",
    "?",
    "is what\u2019s said, and the others go quiet, the backyard goes quiet, everyone stares,",
    "and I want to know now why that someone in me who\u2019s me yet not me let me say it.",
    "Shouldn\u2019t he have told me the contrition cycle would from then be ever upon me,",
    "it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d really only wanted to know how grief ends, and when?",
    "3",
    "I could hear the boy\u2019s mother sobbing inside, then stopping, sobbing then stopping.",
    "Was the end of her grief already there? Had her someone in her told her it would end?",
    "Was her someone in her kinder to her, not tearing at her, as mine did, still does, me,",
    "for guessing grief someday ends? Is that why her sobbing stopped sometimes?",
    "She didn\u2019t laugh, though, or I never heard her.",
    "?",
    "Why couldn\u2019t someone have been there in me not just to accuse me, but to explain?",
    "The kids were playing again, I was playing, I didn\u2019t hear anything more from inside.",
    "The way now sometimes what\u2019s in me is silent, too, and sometimes, though never really, forgets."

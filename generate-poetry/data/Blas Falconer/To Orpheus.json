    "It isn\u2019t madness but shame for wanting",
    "and shame for not having what I want,",
    "which is a kind of madness\u2014drunk,",
    "3 a.m., the stairwell too steep to climb.",
    "The bed can wait. I go to the pool instead,",
    "strip and step in, the smell of smoke and sweat",
    "washing from hair and skin. The wet kiss:",
    "his mouth pressed here, my neck, and there,",
    "my chest\u2014in the end\u2014went nowhere.",
    "Cars pass with coupled strangers. I wade.",
    "The brick wall stretches into the sky,",
    "the sky empty, save the constellations,",
    "whose lives I love\u2014yours most of all,",
    "father of poets, whose lyre filled trees",
    "and stones with awe, the lover torn to shreds",
    "and thrown in to the river. Tonight,",
    "you\u2019re the swan, lost among pinholes of light,",
    "your throat bitten by a black hole",
    "that takes and takes and never fills. I kick,",
    "stroke my tired arms to buoy this body.",
    "It makes ring after perfect ring, but each one",
    "breaks along the edge. You who never were,",
    "did you look down on the world at last",
    "and see that more won\u2019t be enough? Not now.",
    "Not ever. Want picks the human heart.",
    "You\u2019re the lie I won\u2019t believe forever."

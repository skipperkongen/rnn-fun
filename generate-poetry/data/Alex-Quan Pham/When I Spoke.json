    "When I spoke the words",
    "I had let them fester like blood on a prison cell wall.",
    "I hadn\u2019t known that they would free themselves.",
    "They scaled the swollen gutter of my throat, and shot",
    "themselves right through Uncle Andy\u2019s",
    "diaphragm, holding the air in lungs hostage so he",
    "had no words left of his own. He could only unfurl his",
    "vinegar lips to sputter silent",
    "s across my brow.",
    "I kissed the darkness three times, because it stole",
    "those three merciless words from me",
    "before my Mother could.",
    "She told me that I would never",
    "survive a New York winter:",
    "Mother, painted face and gossamer cheeks. It wasn\u2019t you",
    "walking down the hall to Economics, when you heard",
    "a familiar voice, a voice that told jokes you always",
    "laughed at in class, and he said:",
    "tolerate faggots,",
    "but if they flirt with me, I wouldn\u2019t",
    "hesitate",
    "to beat them down.",
    "I swore that was the best joke I\u2019d ever heard, because",
    "my stomach laughed itself into hollow",
    "tree trunk,",

    "Let me tell you what makes me measure",
    "my existence by the pauses, when the silence",
    "between each stammering heartbeat screams",
    "like a head snapping forward.",
    "The taste of gangrene is much",
    "too sweet, so it\u2019s better to slide my fingers across",
    "my swollen gutter throat,",
    "aching for that ticking pulse to just",
    "stand",
    "still,",
    "when each throb of the heart will dance",
    "to the cadence of euthanasia.",
    "But the rabid pounding",
    "against my ribcage,",
    "fists upon flesh, bare-chested,",
    "is the wielding of hammer and chisel.",
    "He is a blacksmith,",

    "I can\u2019t tell you who I am.",
    "But I can tell you that as I sat in that",
    "lavender bedroom, when",
    "my Mother spit that quivering prayer,",
    "fix my boy,",
    "I knew then, the worst combinations of words",
    "always came in threes. But I,",
    "made of only jagged elbows,",
    "clicking jawbone",
    "and slivers of teenage torso,",
    "I pieced each slab of soiled",
    "skin back together, and",
    "I hissed at her,",
    "and you cannot fix what is",
    "not broken.",
    "And I can tell you that once, a woman",
    "christened me Angel",
    "and told me what my Mother couldn\u2019t,",
    "that the venom in my veins",
    "was only stardust.",
    "She had all of her Angels turn their eyes up",
    "to that slice of heaven and we screamed",
    "until we became phoenixes, rising from the ashes",
    "of our yesterdays.",
    "And I can tell you that my little brother",
    "has the voice of weathered sidewalks, rich",
    "with the cracks of prepuberty and smooth",
    "like innocence unsullied. And his",
    "could sing",
    "every spilled breath to sleep.",
    "I can tell you that my Mother",
    "could very well be right when she told me I",
    "would never survive",
    "a New York winter,",

    "Today I became King",
    "of the Court w/out a diamond-",
    "encrusted crown thrust upon",
    "my sweaty head. Instead",
    "my markings of royalty",
    "were the t-shirt draping",
    "my body like a robe soaked",
    "in champagne",
    "the pain",
    "in my right knee \u2014 a sign",
    "of a battle endured, my will",
    "tested",
    "bested by none",
    "as the ball flew off my hands",
    "as swift as an arrow toward",
    "the heart of a target \u2014 my fingers",
    "ringless yet feeling like gold."

    "Sorrento, at night the long fingers of your orange lights",
    "Prick me in the sizzling streets, where the pinnacles",
    "Of other people ring tinny and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Is this the way",
    "Up to the murderous cliff? It\u2019s most important that I get there",
    "And leave no witness. Ah, is this the majolica medallion",
    "Which marks the grave of girl abducted by a stallion",
    "Whom she gave a lump of maple sugar?",
    "For that was in an autumn,",
    "The time of year when young girls get hopeless and feel like",
    "Giving it all away, the way a matronly merchant",
    "Might brush off her lap, at the iron end of the market day:",
    "It\u2019s over, it\u2019s worthless, without deserving and without",
    "Purpose have I nourished this hope in my small patch of earth,",
    "A sickly weed whose nodding sun\u2019s gone nova."

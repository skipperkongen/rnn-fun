    "When I take my scissors to your shirts,",
    "I am frightened: not that they will whimper",
    "But that they won\u2019t understand the violence I mean.",
    "That kind of violence is the other side of love,",
    "Bright as a light-saber and permanent",
    "As the angel\u2019s swords above Eden",
    "Barring that couple with a final X,",
    "That violence means a love strong as death.",
    "Once",
    ", you said, meaning me",
    "And I took those words personally",
    "And knocked upon the door of my heart",
    "Until all its birds flooded to you, in a rush\u2014",
    "Like the Iroquois, I tugged on our peace-pipe,",
    "I wrote your name in smoke. Then went home",
    "With my pockets rolling in shining glass beads,",
    "My pockets so rich with the coin of your country."

    "Wherever the flamingo goes,",
    "she brings a city\u2019s worth",
    "of furbelows. She seems",
    "unnatural by nature\u2014",
    "too vivid and peculiar",
    "a structure to be pretty,",
    "and flexible to the point",
    "of oddity. Perched on",
    "those legs, anything she does",
    "seems like an act. Descending",
    "on her egg or draping her head",
    "along her back, she\u2019s",
    "too exact and sinuous",
    "to convince an audience",
    "she\u2019s serious. The natural elect,",
    "they think, would be less pink,",
    "less able to relax their necks,",
    "less flamboyant in general.",
    "They privately expect that it\u2019s some",
    "poorly jointed bland grey animal",
    "with mitts for hands",
    "whom God protects."

    "In harmony with the rule of irony\u2014",
    "which requires that we harbor the enemy",
    "on this side of the barricade\u2014the shell",
    "of the unborn eagle or pelican, which is made",
    "to give protection till the great beaks can harden,",
    "is the first thing to take up poison.",
    "The mineral case is soft and gibbous",
    "as the moon in a lake\u2014an elastic,",
    "rubbery, nightmare water that won't break.",
    "Elsewhere, also, I see the mockeries of struggle,",
    "a softness over people."

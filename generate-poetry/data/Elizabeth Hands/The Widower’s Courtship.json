    "Roger a doleful widower,",
    "Full eighteen weeks had been,",
    "When he, to meet the milk-maid Nell",
    "Came smiling o\u2019er the green.",
    "Blithe as a lad of seventeen,",
    "He thus accosted Nell;",
    "Give me your pail, I\u2019ll carry it",
    "For you, if you think well.",
    "Says Nell, indeed my milking-pail",
    "You shall not touch, I vow;",
    "I\u2019ve carried it myself before,",
    "And I can carry it now.",
    "So side by side they walked awhile,",
    "Then he at last did say;",
    "My inclination is to come",
    "And see you, if I may.",
    "Nell understood his meaning well,",
    "And briskly answered she;",
    "You may see me at any time,",
    "If you look where I be.",
    "Says he, but hear me yet awhile,",
    "I\u2019ve something more to tell;",
    "I gladly would a sweetheart be",
    "Unto you, Mistress Nell.",
    "A sweetheart I don\u2019t want, says Nell,",
    "Kind Sir, and if you do,",
    "Another you may seek, for I",
    "Am not the lass for you.",
    "When she had made him this reply,",
    "He\u2019d nothing more to say",
    "But \u2014 Nelly, as good night to you,",
    "And homeward went his way."

    "O what a strange parcel of creatures are we,",
    "Scarce ever to quarrel, or even agree;",
    "We all are alone, though at home altogether,",
    "Except to the fire constrained by the weather;",
    "Then one says, \u2018\u2019Tis cold\u2019, which we all of us know,",
    "And with unanimity answer, \u2018\u2019Tis so\u2019:",
    "With shrugs and with shivers all look at the fire,",
    "And shuffle ourselves and our chairs a bit nigher;",
    "Then quickly, preceded by silence profound,",
    "A yawn epidemical catches around:",
    "Like social companions we never fall out,",
    "Nor ever care what one another\u2019s about;",
    "To comfort each other is never our plan,",
    "For to please ourselves, truly, is more than we can."

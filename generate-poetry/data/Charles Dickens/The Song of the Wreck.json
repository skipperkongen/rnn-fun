    "The wind blew high, the waters raved,",
    "A ship drove on the land,",
    "A hundred human creatures saved",
    "Kneel\u2019d down upon the sand.",
    "Three-score were drown\u2019d, three-score were thrown",
    "Upon the black rocks wild,",
    "And thus among them, left alone,",
    "They found one helpless child.",
    "A seaman rough, to shipwreck bred,",
    "Stood out from all the rest,",
    "And gently laid the lonely head",
    "Upon his honest breast.",
    "And travelling o\u2019er the desert wide",
    "It was a solemn joy,",
    "To see them, ever side by side,",
    "The sailor and the boy.",
    "In famine, sickness, hunger, thirst,",
    "The two were still but one,",
    "Until the strong man droop\u2019d the first",
    "And felt his labours done.",
    "Then to a trusty friend he spake,",
    "\u201cAcross the desert wide,",
    "O take this poor boy for my sake!\u201d",
    "And kiss\u2019d the child and died.",
    "Toiling along in weary plight",
    "Through heavy jungle, mire,",
    "These two came later every night",
    "To warm them at the fire.",
    "Until the captain said one day,",
    "\u201cO seaman good and kind,",
    "To save thyself now come away,",
    "And leave the boy behind!\u201d",
    "The child was slumbering near the blaze:",
    "\u201cO captain, let him rest",
    "Until it sinks, when God\u2019s own ways",
    "Shall teach us what is best!\u201d",
    "They watch\u2019d the whiten\u2019d ashy heap,",
    "They touch\u2019d the child in vain;",
    "They did not leave him there asleep,",
    "He never woke again."

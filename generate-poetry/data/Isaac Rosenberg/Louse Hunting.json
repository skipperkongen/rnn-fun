    "Nudes\u2014stark and glistening,",
    "Yelling in lurid glee. Grinning faces",
    "And raging limbs",
    "Whirl over the floor one fire.",
    "For a shirt verminously busy",
    "Yon soldier tore from his throat, with oaths",
    "Godhead might shrink at, but not the lice.",
    "And soon the shirt was aflare",
    "Over the candle he\u2019d lit while we lay.",
    "Then we all sprang up and stript",
    "To hunt the verminous brood.",
    "Soon like a demons\u2019 pantomime",
    "The place was raging.",
    "See the silhouettes agape,",
    "See the gibbering shadows",
    "Mixed with the battled arms on the wall.",
    "See gargantuan hooked fingers",
    "Pluck in supreme flesh",
    "To smutch supreme littleness.",
    "See the merry limbs in hot Highland fling",
    "Because some wizard vermin",
    "Charmed from the quiet this revel",
    "When our ears were half lulled",
    "By the dark music",
    "Blown from Sleep\u2019s trumpet."

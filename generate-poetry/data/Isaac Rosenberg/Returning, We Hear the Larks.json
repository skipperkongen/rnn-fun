    "Sombre the night is:",
    "And, though we have our lives, we know",
    "What sinister threat lurks there.",
    "Dragging these anguished limbs, we only know",
    "This poison-blasted track opens on our camp\u2014",
    "On a little safe sleep.",
    "But hark! Joy\u2014joy\u2014strange joy.",
    "Lo! Heights of night ringing with unseen larks:",
    "Music showering on our upturned listening faces.",
    "Death could drop from the dark",
    "As easily as song\u2014",
    "But song only dropped,",
    "Like a blind man's dreams on the sand",
    "By dangerous tides;",
    "Like a girl's dark hair, for she dreams no ruin lies there,",
    "Or her kisses where a serpent hides."

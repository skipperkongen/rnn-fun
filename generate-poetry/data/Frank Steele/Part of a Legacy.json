    "buttercups fluffing their frail sails,",

    "All of these leaked somehow",
    "into the pillows, looking odd where they",
    "simmered all day, the size of hams, out of place",
    "on grass. And at night I could feel",
    "some part of my mother still with me",
    "in the warmth of my face as I dreamed",
    "baseball and honeysuckle, sleeping",
    "on sunlight."

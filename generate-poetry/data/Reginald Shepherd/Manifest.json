    "Sir star, Herr Lenz, white season body",
    "master snapping masts in half, absent",
    "winds\u2019 workmanship: what window",
    "will I look you through, what brook, stream",
    "creaking past fretwork weeds, clouds",
    "in the context of cold? Lord knot",
    "to be untied, skiff hard alee ill winds:",
    "a hiss of wish and cinders and I",
    "am warm, crossing dazed oceans by hand",
    "to sow the doubtful sea with drought. Mine",
    "of rain and seize and sluice, you change",
    "your mind again, a rage for green waves\u2019",
    "open vowels, undrinkable. No talking",
    "to the weeds, no talking with the snow."

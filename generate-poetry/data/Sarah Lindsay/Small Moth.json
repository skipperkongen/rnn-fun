    "She's slicing ripe white peaches",
    "into the Tony the Tiger bowl",
    "and dropping slivers for the dog",
    "poised vibrating by her foot to stop their fall",
    "when she spots it, camouflaged,",
    "a glimmer and then full on\u2014",
    "happiness, plashing blunt soft wings",
    "inside her as if it wants",
    "to escape again."

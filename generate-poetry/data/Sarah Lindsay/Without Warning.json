    "Elizabeth Bishop leaned on a table, it cracked,",
    "both fell to the floor. A gesture",
    "gone sadly awry. This was close to fact",
    "and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur",
    "in Florida, where she was surrounded",
    "by rotting abundance and greedy insects.",
    "One moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand",
    "alighting on solid furniture,",
    "a casual shift of weight,",
    "the next, undignified splayed legs.",
    "The shell of the table",
    "proved to be stuffed with termite eggs.",
    "True, it was a fall from no great height\u2014",
    "merely the height of herself,",
    "and although the hollowed-out table failed,",
    "at least the floor held,",
    "though probably infested by termites as well,",
    "and possibly built on a latent sinkhole,",
    "how can you tell?",
    "And how could she, smiling and easy,",
    "arm moving without forethought and permission,",
    "have forgotten fear, apparently",
    "let go of a hard-learned lesson?",
    "What you recognize may have changed,",
    "or may change without warning.",
    "Trees fall in hurricanes",
    "and on windless mornings,",
    "breaching houses where people you knew",
    "have vanished or died or stopped loving you.",
    "She regained her feet, already composed,",
    "brushing dust from an elbow. There would be a bruise,",
    "but it would remind her that",
    "flung hard, like paper they fly sideways.",
    "in one breath from heartening to ominous,",
    "proving to children who need more proof",
    "that we don\u2019t know what we know."

    "Speaking of blindness, the man told his one-eyed fianc\u00e9e,",
    "have you heard about the ortolans? Fig-peckers of yellowhammer",
    "descent. Thumb-sized or tongue-sized. Kings used to catch them",
    "at summer\u2019s end, knife-blind them so that in their darkness",
    "they\u2019d feast on millet all day, all night, a break from beetles and seeds,",
    "until they grew from one ounce to four. Drowned",
    "in Armagnac, plucked, placed in a saucepan, roasted,",
    "you eat them whole, so the head dangles between your lips,",
    "crunch bones like hazelnuts, underneath the linen napkin",
    "you must place over your head to create a scent tent",
    "or, so God won\u2019t see your shame. (Proust paired",
    "them with sips of Yquem, a sauterne born of noble",
    "rot \u2014 grapes like ashes, their wet dried",
    "in the nick of time, so honeysuckle turns to bitter",
    "finish.) Mediterranean salt emerges as flight bursts",
    "in your mouth. Imagine yourself a memory, a body full",
    "of meal, as Mitterrand must have, eating ortolans",
    "eight days before dying, his last illegal act. Fifteen minutes",
    "of savoring a supple, burning ball of fat until you exhaust",
    "its roast juices. When you finally swallow, you will regret",
    "the end of a sensual experience. At least once in your life,",
    "you must pay the price for this princely folly."

    "My spirit is too weak\u2014mortality",
    "Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,",
    "And each imagined pinnacle and steep",
    "Of godlike hardship tells me I must die",
    "Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.",
    "Yet \u2019tis a gentle luxury to weep",
    "That I have not the cloudy winds to keep",
    "Fresh for the opening of the morning\u2019s eye.",
    "Such dim-conceived glories of the brain",
    "Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;",
    "So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,",
    "That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude",
    "Wasting of old time\u2014with a billowy main\u2014",
    "A sun\u2014a shadow of a magnitude."

    "I cry your mercy\u2014pity\u2014love! Aye, love!",
    "Merciful love that tantalizes not,",
    "One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,",
    "Unmasked, and being seen\u2014without a blot!",
    "O! let me have thee whole,\u2014all\u2014all\u2014be mine!",
    "That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest",
    "Of love, your kiss,\u2014those hands, those eyes divine,",
    "That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,\u2014",
    "Yourself\u2014your soul\u2014in pity give me all,",
    "Withhold no atom\u2019s atom or I die,",
    "Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,",
    "Forget, in the mist of idle misery,",
    "Life\u2019s purposes,\u2014the palate of my mind",
    "Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!"

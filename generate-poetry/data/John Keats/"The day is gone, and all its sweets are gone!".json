    "The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!",
    "Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,",
    "Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone,",
    "Bright eyes, accomplish\u2019d shape, and lang\u2019rous waist!",
    "Faded the flower and all its budded charms,",
    "Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,",
    "Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,",
    "Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise \u2013",
    "Vanish\u2019d unseasonably at shut of eve,",
    "When the dusk holiday \u2013 or holinight",
    "Of fragrant-curtain\u2019d love begins to weave",
    "The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight,",
    "But, as I\u2019ve read love\u2019s missal through to-day,",
    "He\u2019ll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray."

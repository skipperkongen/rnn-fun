    "Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,",
    "Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;",
    "with him how to load and bless",
    "With fruit the vines that round the",
    "run;",
    "To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,",
    "And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;",
    "To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells",
    "With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,",
    "And still more, later flowers for the bees,",
    "Until they think warm days will never cease,",
    "For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.",
    "Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?",
    "Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find",

    "Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,",
    "Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.",

    "While barred clouds",
    "the soft-dying day,",
    "And touch the",
    "with rosy hue;",
    "Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn",
    "Among the river",
    ", borne aloft",
    "Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;",
    "And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;",
    "Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft",
    "The red-breast whistles from a",

    "And gathering swallows twitter in the skies."

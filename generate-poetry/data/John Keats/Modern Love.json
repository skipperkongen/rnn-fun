    "And what is love? It is a doll dress\u2019d up",
    "For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle;",
    "A thing of soft misnomers, so divine",
    "That silly youth doth think to make itself",
    "Divine by loving, and so goes on",
    "Yawning and doting a whole summer long,",
    "Till Miss\u2019s comb is made a pearl tiara,",
    "And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots;",
    "Then Cleopatra lives at number seven,",
    "And Antony resides in Brunswick Square.",
    "Fools! if some passions high have warm\u2019d the world,",
    "If Queens and Soldiers have play\u2019d deep for hearts,",
    "It is no reason why such agonies",
    "Should be more common than the growth of weeds.",
    "Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl",
    "The Queen of Egypt melted, and I\u2019ll say",
    "That ye may love in spite of beaver hats."

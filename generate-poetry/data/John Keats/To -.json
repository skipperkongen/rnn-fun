    "Had I a man\u2019s fair form, then might my sighs",
    "Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell",
    "Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well",
    "Would passion arm me for the enterprise;",
    "But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;",
    "No cuirass glistens on my bosom\u2019s swell;",
    "I am no happy shepherd of the dell",
    "Whose lips have trembled with a maiden\u2019s eyes.",
    "Yet must I dote upon thee\u2014call thee sweet,",
    "Sweeter by far than Hybla\u2019s honied roses",
    "When steep\u2019d in dew rich to intoxication.",
    "Ah! I will taste that dew, for me \u2018tis meet,",
    "And when the moon her pallid face discloses,",
    "I\u2019ll gather some by spells, and incantation."

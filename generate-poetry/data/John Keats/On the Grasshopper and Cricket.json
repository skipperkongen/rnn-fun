    "The Poetry of earth is never dead:",
    "When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,",
    "And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run",
    "From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;",
    "That is the Grasshopper\u2019s\u2014he takes the lead",
    "In summer luxury,\u2014he has never done",
    "With his delights; for when tired out with fun",
    "He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.",
    "The poetry of earth is ceasing never:",
    "On a lone winter evening, when the frost",
    "Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills",
    "The Cricket\u2019s song, in warmth increasing ever,",
    "And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,",
    "The Grasshopper\u2019s among some grassy hills."

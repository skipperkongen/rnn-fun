    "As Hermes once took to his feathers light,",
    "When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon\u2019d and slept,",
    "So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright",
    "So play\u2019d, so charm\u2019d, so conquer\u2019d, so bereft",
    "The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes;",
    "And seeing it asleep, so fled away,",
    "Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,",
    "Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev\u2019d that day;",
    "But to that second circle of sad Hell,",
    "Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw",
    "Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell",
    "Their sorrows\u2014pale were the sweet lips I saw,",
    "Pale were the lips I kiss\u2019d, and fair the form",
    "I floated with, about that melancholy storm."

    "To one who has been long in city pent,",
    "'Tis very sweet to look into the fair",
    "And open face of heaven,\u2014to breathe a prayer",
    "Full in the smile of the blue firmament.",
    "Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,",
    "Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair",
    "Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair",
    "And gentle tale of love and languishment?",
    "Returning home at evening, with an ear",
    "Catching the notes of Philomel,\u2014an eye",
    "Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,",
    "He mourns that day so soon has glided by:",
    "E'en like the passage of an angel's tear",
    "That falls through the clear ether silently."

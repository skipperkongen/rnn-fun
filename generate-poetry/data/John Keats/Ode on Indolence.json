    "One morn before me were three figures seen,",
    "With bow\u00e8d necks, and join\u00e8d hands, side-faced;",
    "And one behind the other stepp\u2019d serene,",
    "In placid sandals, and in white robes graced;",
    "They pass\u2019d, like figures on a marble urn,",
    "When shifted round to see the other side;",
    "They came again; as when the urn once more",
    "Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;",
    "And they were strange to me, as may betide",
    "With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.",
    "How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not?",
    "How came ye muffled in so hush a mask?",
    "Was it a silent deep-disguis\u00e8d plot",
    "To steal away, and leave without a task",
    "My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour;",
    "The blissful cloud of summer-indolence",
    "Benumb\u2019d my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;",
    "Pain had no sting, and pleasure\u2019s wreath no flower:",
    "O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense",
    "Unhaunted quite of all but\u2014nothingness?",
    "A third time pass\u2019d they by, and, passing, turn\u2019d",
    "Each one the face a moment whiles to me;",
    "Then faded, and to follow them I burn\u2019d",
    "And ached for wings, because I knew the three;",
    "The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name;",
    "The second was Ambition, pale of cheek,",
    "And ever watchful with fatigu\u00e8d eye;",
    "The last, whom I love more, the more of blame",
    "Is heap\u2019d upon her, maiden most unmeek,\u2014",
    "I knew to be my demon Poesy.",
    "They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings:",
    "O folly! What is Love? and where is it?",
    "And for that poor Ambition! it springs",
    "From a man\u2019s little heart\u2019s short fever-fit;",
    "For Poesy!\u2014no,\u2014she has not a joy,\u2014",
    "At least for me,\u2014so sweet as drowsy noons,",
    "And evenings steep\u2019d in honey\u2019d indolence;",
    "O, for an age so shelter\u2019d from annoy,",
    "That I may never know how change the moons,",
    "Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!",
    "And once more came they by:\u2014alas! wherefore?",
    "My sleep had been embroider\u2019d with dim dreams;",
    "My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o\u2019er",
    "With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams:",
    "The morn was clouded, but no shower fell,",
    "Tho\u2019 in her lids hung the sweet tears of May;",
    "The open casement press\u2019d a new-leaved vine,",
    "Let in the budding warmth and throstle\u2019s lay;",
    "O Shadows! \u2019twas a time to bid farewell!",
    "Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.",
    "So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise",
    "My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;",
    "For I would not be dieted with praise,",
    "A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!",
    "Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more",
    "In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn;",
    "Farewell! I yet have visions for the night,",
    "And for the day faint visions there is store;",
    "Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright,",
    "Into the clouds, and never more return!"

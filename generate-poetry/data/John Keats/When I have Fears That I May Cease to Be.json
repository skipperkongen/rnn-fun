    "When I have fears that I may cease to be",
    "Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,",
    "Before high-pil\u00e8d books, in charactery,",
    "Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;",
    "When I behold, upon the night\u2019s starred face,",
    "Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,",
    "And think that I may never live to trace",
    "Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;",
    "And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,",
    "That I shall never look upon thee more,",
    "Never have relish in the faery power",
    "Of unreflecting love\u2014then on the shore",
    "Of the wide world I stand alone, and think",
    "Till love and fame to nothingness do sink."

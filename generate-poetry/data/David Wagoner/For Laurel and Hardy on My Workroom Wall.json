    "They\u2019re tipping their battered derbies and striding forward",
    "In step for a change, chipper, self-assured,",
    "Their cardboard suitcases labeled",
    "Guest of Steerage. They\u2019ve just arrived at the boot camp",
    "Of the good old French Foreign Legion",
    "Which they\u2019ve chosen as their slice of life",
    "Instead of drowning themselves. Once again",
    "They\u2019re about to become their own mothers and fathers",
    "And their own unknowable children",
    "Who will rehearse sad laughter and mock tears,",
    "Will frown with completely unsuccessful",
    "Concentration, and will practice the amazement",
    "Of suddenly understanding everything",
    "That baffles them and will go on baffling them",
    "While they pretend they\u2019re only one reel away",
    "From belonging in the world. Their arrival",
    "Will mark a new beginning of meaningless",
    "Hostilities with a slaphappy ending. In a moment,",
    "They\u2019ll hear music, and as if they\u2019d known all along",
    "This was what they\u2019d come for, they\u2019ll put down",
    "The mops and buckets given them as charms",
    "With which to cleanse the Sahara and move their feet",
    "With a calm, sure, delicate disregard",
    "For all close-order drill and begin dancing."

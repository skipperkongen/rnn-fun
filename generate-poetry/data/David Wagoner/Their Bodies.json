    "That gaunt old man came first, his hair as white",
    "As your scoured tables. Maybe you\u2019ll recollect him",
    "By the scars of steelmill burns on the backs of his hands,",
    "On the nape of his neck, on his arms and sinewy legs,",
    "And her by the enduring innocence",
    "Of her face, as open to all of you in death",
    "As it would have been in life: she would memorize",
    "Your names and ages and pastimes and hometowns",
    "If she could, but she can\u2019t now, so remember her.",
    "They believed in doctors, listened to their advice,",
    "And followed it faithfully. You should treat them",
    "One last time as they would have treated you.",
    "They had been kind to others all their lives",
    "And believed in being useful. Remember somewhere",
    "Their son is trying hard to believe you\u2019ll learn",
    "As much as possible from them, as",
    "did,",
    "And will do your best to learn politely and truly.",
    "They gave away the gift of those useful bodies",
    "Against his wish. (They had their own ways",
    "Of doing everything, always.) If you\u2019re not certain",
    "Which ones are theirs, be gentle to everybody."

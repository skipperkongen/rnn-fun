    "Test for the Old Smile, they\u2019re going to roast it\u2014",
    "it\u2019ll have to keep its ends up all night,",
    "for the secretary says she finds it creepy,",
    "and the golfing partner says you got that right,",
    "and the rival says it\u2019s fake, and the ambitious",
    "junior makes his point with a few slides,",
    "and the protege the Smile was always sweet to",
    "walks up and says it turns his insides.",
    "They harp on it, the bosses and the buddies,",
    "and things get even better by these lights,",
    "which is to say it\u2019s shredded like a secret,",
    "which is to say it\u2019s one of the great nights;",
    "and folks are saying so while they\u2019re still roasting:",
    "they cry out to the Smile and it smiles back,",
    "like something huge is burdening a hammock,",
    "or is until you hear a frightful crack.\u2014",
    "And then you better run like you saw nothing.",
    "And then you better run like you weren\u2019t there.",
    "There is a line, it\u2019s long and isn\u2019t smiling.",
    "You won\u2019t believe me when I tell you where."

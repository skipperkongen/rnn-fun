    "The grave has more power than the eyes of the beloved.",
    "An open grave with all its magnets.",
    "This weight on the wings. The sky is waiting for an airship.",
    "I have the feeling that I haven\u2019t got much life left.",
    "Three hours after the celestial attack.",
    "Why don\u2019t I respond when I\u2019m being offended?",
    "Because my religion doesn\u2019t allow me to.",
    "Exterior maps: geography. Interior maps: psychography.",
    "And in your hard cathedral I kneel.",
    "Mountains pass camels pass",
    "like the history of wars in antiquity.",
    "Of all the men I am, I can\u2019t find any of them",
    "without the control of the intruding eye.",
    "Problems. Mysteries that fasten themselves to my chest.",
    "All I want is not to see businesses nor gardens",
    "nor markets nor eyeglasses nor elevators.",
    "In order to serve all radio listeners,",
    "without discriminating between social classes, I speak a tongue",
    "that fills hearts with the law of communicating clouds.",
    "I have my brain or whatever it is full of skull moths.",
    "For the world to go on being what it is it must",
    "\u2014per force\u2014take another form.",
    "True poems are fires. When something cherished burns",
    "instead of the fireman I call, rushes forth the incendiary.",
    "It says: live, live, live!",
    "It is Death."

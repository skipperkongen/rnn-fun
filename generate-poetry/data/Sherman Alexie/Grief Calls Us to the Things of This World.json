    "The eyes open to a blue telephone",
    "In the bathroom of this five-star hotel.",
    "I wonder whom I should call? A plumber,",
    "Proctologist, urologist, or priest?",
    "Who is blessed among us and most deserves",
    "The first call? I choose my father because",
    "He\u2019s astounded by bathroom telephones.",
    "I dial home. My mother answers. \u201cHey, Ma,\u201d",
    "I say, \u201cCan I talk to Poppa?\u201d She gasps,",
    "And then I remember that my father",
    "Has been dead for nearly a year. \u201cShit, Mom,\u201d",
    "I say. \u201cI forgot he\u2019s dead. I\u2019m sorry\u2014",
    "How did I forget?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says.",
    "\u201cI made him a cup of instant coffee",
    "This morning and left it on the table\u2014",
    "Like I have for, what, twenty-seven years\u2014",
    "And I didn\u2019t realize my mistake",
    "Until this afternoon.\u201d My mother laughs",
    "At the angels who wait for us to pause",
    "During the most ordinary of days",
    "And sing our praise to forgetfulness",
    "Before they slap our souls with their cold wings.",
    "Those angels burden and unbalance us.",
    "Those fucking angels ride us piggyback.",
    "Those angels, forever falling, snare us",
    "And haul us, prey and praying, into dust."

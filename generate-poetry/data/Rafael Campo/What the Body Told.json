    "Not long ago, I studied medicine.",
    "It was terrible, what the body told.",
    "I\u2019d look inside another person\u2019s mouth,",
    "And see the desolation of the world.",
    "I\u2019d see his genitals and think of sin.",
    "Because my body speaks the stranger\u2019s language,",
    "I\u2019ve never understood those nods and stares.",
    "My parents held me in their arms, and still",
    "I think I\u2019ve disappointed them; they care",
    "And stare, they nod, they make their pilgrimage",
    "To somewhere distant in my heart, they cry.",
    "I look inside their other-person\u2019s mouths",
    "And see the wet interior of souls.",
    "It\u2019s warm and red in there\u2014like love, with teeth.",
    "I\u2019ve studied medicine until I cried",
    "All night. Through certain books, a truth unfolds.",
    "Anatomy and physiology,",
    "The tiny sensing organs of the tongue\u2014",
    "Each nameless cell contributing its needs.",
    "It was fabulous, what the body told."

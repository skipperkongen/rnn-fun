    "It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like the hospital.",
    "Those small bouquets of flowers, pert and brave.",
    "The smell of antiseptic cleansers.",
    "The ill, so wistful in their rooms, so true.",
    "My friend, the one who\u2019s dying, took me out",
    "To where the patients go to smoke, IV\u2019s",
    "And oxygen in tanks attached to them\u2014",
    "A tiny patio for skeletons. We shared",
    "A cigarette, which was delicious but",
    "Too brief. I held his hand; it felt",
    "Like someone\u2019s keys. How beautiful it was,",
    "The sunlight pointing down at us, as if",
    "We were important, full of life, unbound.",
    "I wandered for a moment where his ribs",
    "Had made a space for me, and there, beside",
    "The thundering waterfall of his heart,",
    "I rubbed my eyes and thought, \u201cI\u2019m lost.\u201d"

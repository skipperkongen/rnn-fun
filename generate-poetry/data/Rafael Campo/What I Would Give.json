    "What I would like to give them for a change",
    "is not the usual prescription with",
    "its hubris of the power to restore,",
    "to cure; what I would like to give them, ill",
    "from not enough of laying in the sun",
    "not caring what the onlookers might think",
    "while feeding some banana to their dogs\u2014",
    "what I would like to offer them is this,",
    "not reassurance that their lungs sound fine,",
    "or that the mole they\u2019ve noticed change is not",
    "a melanoma, but instead of fear",
    "transfigured by some doctorly advice",
    "I\u2019d like to give them my astonishment",
    "at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping,",
    "and how ridiculously gently it",
    "slicked down my hair; I\u2019d like to give them that,",
    "the joy I felt while staring in your eyes",
    "as you learned epidemiology",
    "(the science of disease in populations),",
    "the night around our bed like timelessness,",
    "like comfort, like what I would give to them."

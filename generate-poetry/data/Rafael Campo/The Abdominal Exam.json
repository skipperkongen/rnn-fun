    "Before the glimmer of his sunken eyes,",
    "What question could I answer with my lies?",
    "Digesting everything, it\u2019s all so plain",
    "In him, his abdomen so thin the pain",
    "Is almost visible. I probe the lump",
    "His boyfriend noticed first, my left hand limp",
    "Beneath the pressure of the right. With AIDS",
    "You have to think lymphoma\u2014swollen nodes,",
    "A tender spleen, the liver\u2019s jutting edge\u2014",
    "It strikes me suddenly I will oblige",
    "This hunger that announces death is near,",
    "And as I touch him, cold and cavalier,",
    "The language of beneath the diaphragm",
    "Has told me where it\u2019s coming from",
    "And where I\u2019m going, too: soft skin to rocks,",
    "The body reveling until it wrecks",
    "Against the same internal, hidden shoal,",
    "The treasures we can\u2019t hide, our swallowed gold."

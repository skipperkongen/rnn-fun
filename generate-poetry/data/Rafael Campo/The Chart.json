    "Says fifty-four-year-old obese Hispanic",
    "female \u2014 I wonder if they mean the one",
    "with long black braids, Peruvian, who sells",
    "tamales at the farmers\u2019 market, tells",
    "me I\u2019m too thin, I better eat; or is",
    "she the Dominican with too much rouge",
    "and almond eyes at the dry cleaner\u2019s who",
    "must have been so beautiful in her youth;",
    "or maybe she\u2019s the Cuban lady drunk",
    "on grief who I\u2019ve seen half-asleep, alone",
    "as if that bench were only hers, the park",
    "her home at last; or else the Mexican",
    "who hoards the littered papers she collects",
    "and says they are her \u201cdocuments\u201d; if not,",
    "it could be that Colombian drug addict",
    "whose Spanish, even when she\u2019s high, is perfect;",
    "or maybe it\u2019s the one who never says",
    "exactly where she\u2019s from, but who reminds",
    "me of my grandmother, poor but refined,",
    "lace handkerchief balled up in her plump hand,",
    "who died too young from a condition that",
    "some doctor, nose in her chart, overlooked."

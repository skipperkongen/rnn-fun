    "An idle poet, here and there,",
    "Looks round him; but, for all the rest,",
    "The world, unfathomably fair,",
    "Is duller than a witling\u2019s jest.",
    "Love wakes men, once a lifetime each;",
    "They lift their heavy lids, and look;",
    "And, lo, what one sweet page can teach,",
    "They read with joy, then shut the book.",
    "And some give thanks, and some blaspheme",
    "And most forget; but, either way,",
    "That and the Child\u2019s unheeded dream",
    "Is all the light of all their day."

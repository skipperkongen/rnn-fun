    "Yet the after is still a storm",
    "as witness bent shadbush",
    "and cord grass in stillness",
    "sand littered with the smallest of fragments",
    "whether shell or bone",
    "That city we are far from",
    "is still frozen, still in ruins",
    "(except its symmetries be renewed",
    "by sleep, its slant colors redeemed)",
    "Nothing has changed but its name",
    "and the air that it breathes",
    "There\u2019s still no truth in making sense",
    "while the ash settles, so fine that",
    "planes keep falling from the sky",
    "And the name once again to be the old one",
    "Saint Something, Saint Gesture, Saint Entirely the Same",
    "as if nothing or no one had been nameless in the interim",
    "or as if",
    "could be placed beside",
    "that simply, as in a poem",
    "Have you heard the angels with sexed tongues,",
    "met the blind boy who could see with his skin,",
    "his body curled inward like a phrase,",
    "like an after in stillness or a letter erased",
    "Have you seen what\u2019s written on him",
    "as question to an answer or calendar out of phase",
    "Add up the number of such days",
    "Add",
    "and",
    "as formed on the tongue",
    "Add that scene identical with its negative,",
    "that sentence which refuses to speak,",
    "present which cannot be found"

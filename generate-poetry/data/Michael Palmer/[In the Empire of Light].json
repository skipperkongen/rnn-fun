    "In the Empire of Light",
    "the water\u2019s completely dry",
    "floating on a surface of itself",
    "around islands pointed south-southwest",
    "The wind fills it then",
    "with more of itself",
    "according to the rules",
    "which cause parallel lines",
    "to vibrate and cross",
    "less and less",
    "among the hanging baskets from a rain forest",
    "among the visiting statesmen",
    "from a rain forest",
    "Here the dancer stops",
    "to regain her balance",
    "and reelaborate the distance",
    "from the feet to the head",
    "The risk is a part of the rhythm",
    "She steps out of",
    "and into balance",
    "with those who are left",
    "Chalk-marks show them where to stand"

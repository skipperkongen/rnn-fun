    "The bend in the river followed us for days",
    "and above us the sun",
    "doubled and redoubled its claims",
    "Now we are in a house",
    "with forty-four walls",
    "and nothing but doors",
    "Outside the trees, chokecherries, mulberries and oaks",
    "are cracking like limbs",
    "We can do nothing but listen",
    "or so someone claims,",
    "the Ice Man perhaps, all enclosed in ice",
    "though the light has been shortening our days",
    "and coloring nights the yellow of hay,",
    "scarlet of trillium, blue of block ice",
    "Words appear, the texture of ice,",
    "with messages etched on their shells:",
    "Enough of such phrases and we\u2019ll have a book",
    "Enough of such books",
    "and we\u2019ll have mountains of ice",
    "enough to balance our days with nights",
    "enough at last to close our eyes"

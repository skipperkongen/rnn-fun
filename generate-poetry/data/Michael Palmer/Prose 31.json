    "A logical principle is said to be an empty",
    "or formal proposition because it can add",
    "nothing to the premises of the argument it",

    "self-contradictory. (It is also ambiguous.)",
    "The definition of the possible as that which",
    "in a given state of information (real or",
    "pretended) we do not know not to be true",
    "conceals another anacoluthon."

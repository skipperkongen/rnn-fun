    "As if by saying \u201cmorning\u201d on January 8th",
    "the light would be set forward",
    "along the megalophonous shore",
    "Was there anything else you wanted to know",
    "about the body where I belong",
    "how the torso is cut off from a waving arm",
    "by the yellow space in the background",
    "and how the head has been put on wrong",
    "or not wrong. Each looked into the water",
    "and was frightened by a different thing",
    "of his or her own making",
    "One was frightened by stripes",
    "and the other by a turtle",
    "even though I knew it wouldn\u2019t bite",
    "but would take me for a ride",
    "It was the time when the phone always rings",
    "to dissolve the mediating scene",
    "in which a phone always rings",
    "to help us with our counting",
    "I say hello to the lateral darkness",
    "who answers guardedly",
    "in painted fragments. The drop of a hat",
    "If the shoe fits. A thin bird flaps",
    "before it sits. Who answers noiselessly",
    "Hans Memling is watching from my matchbox",
    "where the serpent lives",
    "This is his nest"

    "The round and sad-eyed man puffed cigars as if",
    "he were alive. Gillyflowers",
    "to the left of the apple, purple bells to the right",
    "and a grass-covered hill behind.",
    "I am sad today said the sad-eyed man",
    "for I have locked my head in a Japanese box",
    "and lost the key.",
    "I am sad today he told me",
    "for there are gillyflowers by the apple",
    "and purple bells I cannot see.",
    "Will you look at them for me",
    "he asked, and tell me what you find?",
    "I cannot I replied",
    "for my eyes have grown sugary and dim",
    "from reading too long by candlelight.",
    "Tell me what you\u2019ve read then",
    "said the round and sad-eyed man.",
    "I cannot I replied",
    "for my memory has grown tired and dim",
    "from looking at things that can\u2019t be seen",
    "by any kind of light",
    "and I\u2019ve locked my head in a Japanese box",
    "and thrown away the key.",
    "Then I am you and you are me",
    "said the sad-eyed man as if alive.",
    "I\u2019ll write you in where I should be",
    "between the gillyflowers and the purple bells",
    "and the apple and the hill",
    "and we\u2019ll puff cigars from noon till night",
    "as if we were alive."

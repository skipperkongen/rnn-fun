    "There's a flutter of grey through the trees:",
    "Ah, the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes",
    "Fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is!",
    "I see not her face, I but see",
    "The swift re-appearance, the flitting persistence\u2014",
    "There!\u2014of that flutter of grey in the distance.",
    "It has flickered and fluttered away:",
    "What a teasing regret she has left in my day-dream,",
    "And what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may",
    "dream!",
    "It was only a flutter of grey;",
    "But the vaguest of raiment's impossible chances",
    "Has set my heart beating the way of old dances."

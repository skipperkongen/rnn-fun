    "She kept them high on the top shelf,",
    "In boxes big as drums\u2014",
    "Bright, crescent-shaped boats",
    "With little fishnets dangling down\u2014",
    "And wore them with her best dress",
    "To teas, coffee parties, department stores.",
    "What a lovely catch, my father used to say,",
    "Watching her sail off into the afternoon waters."

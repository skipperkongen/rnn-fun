    "I could fix the leaky pipe",

    "To the local mall and browse",
    "Through the bright stables",
    "Of mowers, or maybe catch",
    "The power-walkers puffing away",
    "On their last laps. I could clean",
    "The garage, weed the garden,",
    "Or get out the shears and",
    "Prune the rose bushes back.",
    "Yes, a thousand things",
    "This beautiful April morning.",
    "Rocking like a lazy metronome,",
    "And wait for the day lilies",
    "To open. The sun is barely",
    "Over the trees, and already",
    "The sprinklers are out,",
    "Raining their immaculate",
    "Bands of light over the lawns."

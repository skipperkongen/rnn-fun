    "This admirable gadget, when it is",
    "Wound on a string and spun with steady force,",
    "Maintains its balance on most any smooth",
    "Surface, pleasantly humming as it goes.",
    "It is whirled not on a constant course, but still",
    "Stands in unshivering integrity",
    "For quite some time, meaning nothing perhaps",
    "But being something agreeable to watch,",
    "A silver nearly silence gleaning a still-",
    "ness out of speed, composing unity",
    "From spin, so that its hollow spaces seem",
    "Solids of light, until it wobbles and",
    "Begins to whine, and then with an odd lunge",
    "Eccentric and reckless, it skids away",
    "And drops dead into its own skeleton."

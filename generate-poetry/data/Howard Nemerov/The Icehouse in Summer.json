    "A door sunk in a hillside, with a bolt",
    "thick as the boy\u2019s arm, and behind that door",
    "the walls of ice, melting a blue, faint light,",
    "an air of cedar branches, sawdust, fern:",
    "decaying seasons keeping from decay.",
    "A summer guest, the boy had never seen",
    "(a servant told him of it) how the lake",
    "froze three foot thick, how farmers came with teams,",
    "with axe and saw, to cut great blocks of ice,",
    "translucid, marbled, glittering in the sun,",
    "load them on sleds and drag them up the hill",
    "to be manhandled down the narrow path",
    "and set in courses for the summer\u2019s keeping,",
    "the kitchen uses and luxuriousness",
    "of the great houses. And he heard how once",
    "a team and driver drowned in the break of spring:",
    "the man\u2019s cry melting from the ice that summer",
    "frightened the sherbet-eaters off the terrace.",
    "Dust of the cedar, lost and evergreen",
    "among the slowly blunting water walls",
    "where the blade edge melted and the steel saw\u2019s bite",
    "was rounded out, and the horse and rider drowned",
    "in the red sea\u2019s blood, I was the silly child",
    "who dreamed that riderless cry, and saw the guests",
    "run from a ghostly wall, so long before",
    "the winter house fell with the summer house,",
    "and the houses, Egypt, the great houses, had an end."

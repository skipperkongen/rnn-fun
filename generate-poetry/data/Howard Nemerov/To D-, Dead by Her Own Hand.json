    "My dear, I wonder if before the end",
    "You ever thought about a children\u2019s game\u2014",
    "I\u2019m sure you must have played it too\u2014in which",
    "You ran along a narrow garden wall",
    "Pretending it to be a mountain ledge",
    "So steep a snowy darkness fell away",
    "On either side to deeps invisible;",
    "And when you felt your balance being lost",
    "You jumped because you feared to fall, and thought",
    "For only an instant: That was when I died.",
    "That was a life ago. And now you\u2019ve gone,",
    "Who would no longer play the grown-ups\u2019 game",
    "Where, balanced on the ledge above the dark,",
    "You go on running and you don\u2019t look down,",
    "Nor ever jump because you fear to fall."

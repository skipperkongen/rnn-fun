    "The hard thing\u2019s to sit without being noticed.",
    "Everything else will come easy. Three sips",
    "and the impulse returns to sit thinking alone.",
    "Against the buzzing backdrop of noise",
    "everything fades, and it\u2019s suddenly a miracle",
    "to be born and to stare at the glass. And work",
    "(a man who\u2019s alone can\u2019t not think of work)",
    "becomes again the old fate that suffering\u2019s good",
    "for focusing thought. And soon the eyes fix",
    "on nothing particular, grieved, as if blind.",
    "If this man gets up and goes home to sleep,",
    "he\u2019ll look like a blind man that\u2019s lost. Anyone",
    "could jump out of nowhere to brutally beat him.",
    "A woman\u2014beautiful, young\u2014might appear,",
    "and lie under a man in the street, and moan,",
    "the way a woman once moaned under him.",
    "But this man doesn\u2019t see. He heads home to sleep",
    "and life becomes nothing but the buzzing of silence.",
    "Undressing this man you\u2019d find a body that\u2019s wasted",
    "and, here and there, patches of fur. Who\u2019d think,",
    "to look at this man, that life once burned",
    "in his lukewarm veins? No one would guess",
    "that there was a woman, once, who gently touched",
    "that body, who kissed that body, which shakes,",
    "and wet it with tears, now that the man,",
    "having come home to sleep, can\u2019t sleep, only moan."

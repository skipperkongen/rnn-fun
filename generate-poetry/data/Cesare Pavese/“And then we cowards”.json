    "And then we cowards",
    "who loved the whispering",
    "evening, the houses,",
    "the paths by the river,",
    "the dirty red lights",
    "of those places, the sweet",
    "soundless sorrow\u2014",
    "we reached our hands out",
    "toward the living chain",
    "in silence, but our heart",
    "startled us with blood,",
    "and no more sweetness then,",
    "no more losing ourselves",
    "on the path by the river\u2014",
    "no longer slaves, we knew",
    "we were alone and alive."

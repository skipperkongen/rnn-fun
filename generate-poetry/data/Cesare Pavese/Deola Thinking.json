    "Deola passes her mornings sitting in a cafe,",
    "and nobody looks at her. Everyone\u2019s rushing to work,",
    "under a sun still fresh with the dawn. Even Deola",
    "isn\u2019t looking for anyone: she smokes serenely, breathing",
    "the morning. In years past, she slept at this hour",
    "to recover her strength: the throw on her bed",
    "was black with the boot-prints of soldiers and workers,",
    "the backbreaking clients. But now, on her own,",
    "it\u2019s different: the work\u2019s more refined, and it\u2019s easier.",
    "Like the gentleman yesterday, who woke her up early,",
    "kissed her, and took her (",
    "in Turin with you, if I could) to the station",
    "to tell him goodbye.",
    "She\u2019s dazed this morning, but fresh\u2014",
    "Deola likes being free, likes drinking her milk",
    "and eating brioches. This morning she\u2019s nearly a lady,",
    "and if she looks at anyone now, it\u2019s just to pass the time.",
    "The girls at the house are still sleeping. The air stinks,",
    "the madam goes out for a walk, it\u2019s crazy to stay there.",
    "To work the bars in the evening you have to look good;",
    "at that house, by thirty, you\u2019ve lost what little looks you had left.",
    "Deola sits with her profile turned toward a mirror",
    "and looks at herself in the cool of the glass: her face pale,",
    "and not from the smoke; her brow a bit furrowed.",
    "To survive at that house, you\u2019d need a will",
    "like Mar\u00ed used to have (",
    "come here to get something they can\u2019t get at home",
    "from their wives or their lovers) and Mar\u00ed used to work",
    "tirelessly, full of good cheer and blessed with good health.",
    "The people who pass the cafe aren\u2019t distracting Deola\u2014",
    "she only works evenings, making slow conquests",
    "to music, in her usual bar. She\u2019ll make eyes.",
    "at a client, or nudge his foot, while enjoying the band",
    "that makes her seem like an actress doing a love scene",
    "with a young millionaire. One client each evening",
    "is enough to scrape by on. (",
    "really will take me with him.) To be alone, if she wants,",
    "in the morning. To sit in a caf\u00e9. To not look for anyone."

    "It\u2019s a fine fact that whenever I sit in a tavern corner",
    "sipping a grappa, the pederast\u2019s there, or the kids",
    "with their screaming, or the unemployed guy,",
    "or some beautiful girl outside\u2014all breaking",
    "the thread of my smoke.",
    "I\u2019m telling it straight, I work at Lucento.",
    "But that voice, that sorrowful voice of the old man",
    "(forty-ish, maybe?) who shook my hand",
    "one night in the cold and then walked with me back",
    "to my house, that tone like an old cornet\u2014",
    "I\u2019ll never forget it, not even in death.",
    "He said nothing of wine, but spoke to me then",
    "because I had suffered and was smoking a pipe.",
    "\u201cAnd pipe smokers,\u201d he declared, shaking a little,",
    "\u201ccan always be trusted!\u201d I nodded my head.",
    "their skirts cut higher\u2014this after months of hunger\u2014",
    "and I went and got married because I was drunk",
    "on all their freshness\u2014a senile love.",
    "I married the sassiest, most muscular girl",
    "so I\u2019d taste life again, so I wouldn\u2019t die",
    "behind a desk, in an office, surrounded by strangers.",
    "But Nella too was a stranger to me, and a student pilot",
    "saw her with me once, and later laid hands on her.",
    "He\u2019s dead now, that coward\u2014that poor kid\u2014",
    "spun out of the sky\u2014I guess I\u2019m the coward.",
    "Now she\u2019s got her baby\u2014who knows if he\u2019s mine\u2014",
    "and she\u2019s home all the time and I\u2019m just a stranger",
    "who can\u2019t keep her happy. I don\u2019t dare say a word",
    "and neither does Nella, she just looks at me.",
    "It was beautiful how he cried as he told it,",
    "the way a drunk cries, his whole body to it,",
    "and he hung on my shoulder saying,",
    "always respect, and there I was, shaking with cold,",
    "wanting to leave, and helping him walk.",
    "Sipping grappa is nice, but there\u2019s also a pleasure",
    "in listening to the venting of an impotent old man",
    "who\u2019s back from the front and asks your forgiveness.",
    "I\u2019m telling it straight, I work at Lucento.",
    "What satisfaction will I ever have in this life?"

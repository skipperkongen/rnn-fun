    "Constancy is an evolution of one\u2019s living quarters into",
    "a thought: a continuation of a parallelogram or a rectangle",
    "by means\u2014as Clausewitz would have put it\u2014",
    "of the voice and, ultimately, the gray matter.",
    "Ah, shrunken to the size of a brain-cell parlor",
    "with a lampshade, an armoire in the \u201cSlavic",
    "Glory\u201d fashion, four studded chairs, a sofa,",
    "a bed, a bedside table with",
    "little medicine bottles left there standing like",
    "a kremlin or, better yet, manhattan.",
    "To die, to abandon a family, to go away for good,",
    "to change hemispheres, to let new ovals",
    "be painted into the square\u2014the more",
    "volubly will the gray cell insist",
    "on its actual measurements, demanding",
    "daily sacrifice from the new locale,",
    "from the furniture, from the silhouette in a yellow",
    "dress; in the end\u2014from your very self.",
    "A spider revels in shading especially the fifth corner.",
    "Evolution is not a species\u2019",
    "adjustment to a new environment but one\u2019s memories\u2019",
    "triumph over reality, the ichthyosaurus pining",
    "for the amoeba, the slack vertebrae of a train",
    "thundering in the darkness, past",
    "the mussel shells, tightly shut for the night, with their",
    "spineless, soggy, pearl-shrouding contents."

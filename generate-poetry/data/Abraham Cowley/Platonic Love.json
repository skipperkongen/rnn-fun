    "1",
    "Indeed I must confess,",
    "When souls mix \u2019tis an happiness,",
    "But not complete till bodies too do join,",
    "And both our wholes into one whole combine;",
    "But half of heaven the souls in glory taste",
    "Till by love in heaven at last",
    "Their bodies too are placed.",
    "2",
    "In thy immortal part",
    "Man, as well as I, thou art.",
    "But something \u2019tis that differs thee and me,",
    "And we must one even in that difference be.",
    "I thee both as a man and woman prize,",
    "For a perfect love implies",
    "Love in all capacities.",
    "3",
    "Can that for true love pass",
    "When a fair woman courts her glass?",
    "Something unlike must in love\u2019s likeness be:",
    "His wonder is one and variety.",
    "For he whose soul nought but a soul can move",
    "Does a new Narcissus prove,",
    "And his own image love.",
    "4",
    "That souls do beauty know",
    "\u2019Tis to the body\u2019s help they owe;",
    "If when they know\u2019t they straight abuse that trust",
    "And shut the body from\u2019t, \u2019tis as unjust",
    "As if I brought my dearest friend to see",
    "My mistress and at th\u2019instant he",
    "Should steal her quite from me."

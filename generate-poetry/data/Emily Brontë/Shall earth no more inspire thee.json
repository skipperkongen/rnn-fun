    "Shall earth no more inspire thee,",
    "Thou lonely dreamer now?",
    "Since passion may not fire thee",
    "Shall Nature cease to bow?",
    "Thy mind is ever moving",
    "In regions dark to thee;",
    "Recall its useless roving\u0097",
    "Come back and dwell with me.",
    "I know my mountain breezes",
    "Enchant and soothe thee still\u0097",
    "I know my sunshine pleases",
    "Despite thy wayward will.",
    "When day with evening blending",
    "Sinks from the summer sky,",
    "I\u2019ve seen thy spirit bending",
    "In fond idolatry.",
    "I\u2019ve watched thee every hour;",
    "I know my mighty sway,",
    "I know my magic power",
    "To drive thy griefs away.",
    "Few hearts to mortals given",
    "On earth so wildly pine;",
    "Yet none would ask a heaven",
    "More like this earth than thine.",
    "Then let my winds caress thee;",
    "Thy comrade let me be\u0097",
    "Since nought beside can bless thee,",
    "Return and dwell with me."

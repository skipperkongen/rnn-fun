    "I am the only being whose doom",
    "No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn;",
    "I never caused a thought of gloom,",
    "A smile of joy, since I was born.",
    "In secret pleasure, secret tears,",
    "This changeful life has slipped away,",
    "As friendless after eighteen years,",
    "As lone as on my natal day.",
    "There have been times I cannot hide,",
    "There have been times when this was drear,",
    "When my sad soul forgot its pride",
    "And longed for one to love me here.",
    "But those were in the early glow",
    "Of feelings since subdued by care;",
    "And they have died so long ago,",
    "I hardly now believe they were.",
    "First melted off the hope of youth,",
    "Then fancy\u2019s rainbow fast withdrew;",
    "And then experience told me truth",
    "In mortal bosoms never grew.",
    "\u2019Twas grief enough to think mankind",
    "All hollow, servile, insincere;",
    "But worse to trust to my own mind",
    "And find the same corruption there"

    "Love is like the wild rose-briar,",
    "Friendship like the holly-tree\u2014",
    "The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms",
    "But which will bloom most constantly?",
    "The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,",
    "Its summer blossoms scent the air;",
    "Yet wait till winter comes again",
    "And who will call the wild-briar fair?",
    "Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now",
    "And deck thee with the holly\u2019s sheen,",
    "That when December blights thy brow",
    "He still may leave thy garland green."

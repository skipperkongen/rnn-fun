    "I killed a fly",
    "and laid my weapon next to it",
    "as one lays the weapon of a dead hero",
    "beside his body\u2014the fly",
    "that tried to mount the window",
    "to its top; that was born out of a swamp",
    "to die in a bold effort beyond itself,",
    "and I am the one who brought it to an end.",
    "Tired of the day and with night coming on",
    "I lay my body down beside the fly."

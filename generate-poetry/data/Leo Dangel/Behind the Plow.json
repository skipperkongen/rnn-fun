    "I look in the turned sod",
    "for an iron bolt that fell",
    "from the plow frame",
    "and find instead an arrowhead",
    "with delicate, chipped edges,",
    "still sharp, not much larger",
    "than a woman\u2019s long fingernail.",
    "Pleased, I put the arrowhead",
    "into my overalls pocket,",
    "knowing that the man who shot",
    "the arrow and lost his work",
    "must have looked for it",
    "much longer than I will",
    "look for that bolt."

    "In the early afternoon my mother",
    "was doing the dishes. I climbed",
    "onto the kitchen table, I suppose",
    "to play, and fell asleep there.",
    "I was drowsy and awake, though,",
    "as she lifted me up, carried me",
    "on her arms into the living room,",
    "and placed me on the davenport,",
    "but I pretended to be asleep",
    "the whole time, enjoying the luxury\u2014",
    "I was too big for such a privilege",
    "and just old enough to form",
    "my only memory of her carrying me.",
    "She\u2019s still moving me to a softer place."

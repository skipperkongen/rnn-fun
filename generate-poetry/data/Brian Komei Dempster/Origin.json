    "Through darkness they came,",
    "covered in ash, scarred by depths",
    "and distance, they bore salt and fire, breath steaming",
    "at edges of decks, hands clutching",
    "railings, their bodies dizzied by the lurching vessel,",
    "trunks pulled by hand,",
    "I unwrapped",
    "my legacy from cloth, the marble Buddha",
    "from my grandfather, ancient",
    "as the sea-stained covers of his sutras, the briny odor",
    "of carp centuries old.",
    "Not only where they were from but who they were",
    "and would become. His strange",
    "past and the mystery of my own face,",
    "this question flawed as we all",
    "appeared, my grandfather's birthplace the half of me",
    "I lightened, bleaching my black hair",
    "to reach my girlfriend Amber's blonde.",
    "In her candlelit room, I touched",
    "the mission photo of her",
    "rubbing ointment on the burns",
    "of a",
    "water-filled troughs and the horses' manes",
    "my grandfather combed. The hay he bundled",
    "in twine,",
    "Could he have smoothed names",
    "engraved in granite, the scars on the woman's skin, targets",
    "raised on maps? In a light blast",
    "a city",
    "of",
    "was erased,",
    "A blank scape,",
    "no trace of his childhood farm",
    "in Hiroshima,",
    "I turned",
    "away from the chalkboard scrawled",
    "with Enola Gay,",
    "a button pushed,",
    "a bomb dropped, at Amber's picnic",
    "they bowed over grace, and I looked up, didn't",
    "say Amen. Everything rises",
    "when the ground's skin is broken."

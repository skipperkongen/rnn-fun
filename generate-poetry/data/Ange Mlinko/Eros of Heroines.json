    "Sunset backlights some pine to ... a caped sponge",
    "and though I throw my gasp after a monarch there is no hitch,",
    "no hitching either to its serape or the echoing orange",
    "drawing a rope, horizon\u2019s doubledutch.",
    "As blood hits the air & goes red, so I burst outside exhilarated.",
    "He has thrown a tippet on the double-bass, which rests on its end-pin",
    "the way a singer rests on a glittering stiletto",
    "while the other foot slips on a banan\u2014piano. The strings",
    "are not the electrified wires of a prison camp, but she\u2019s the instrument",
    "of his escape, leaving me to educate my feelings,",
    "subtracting the red from night til a winebottle dawns green.",
    "I saw the chessplayers over their griddles, all the furor of thinking",
    "swallowed like a song in a furred flute; so it must seem",
    "when a small daughter disappears with a wife,",
    "morning reabsorbed into a lambent priori."

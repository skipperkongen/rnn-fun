    "resembles an orchid",
    "so my buds indubitably mimic pricking ice cream cones.",
    "Love, little by little it dawned on us the artisanal",
    "ice cream, especially the prizewinning caramel,",
    "would be out of our reach,",
    "like the previous Friday of a Sunday leaving the beach,",
    "in the meltdown.",
    "When you gasp at the sound\ufb01le of cymbals",
    "you can hear the wedding ring,",
    "When you hear the sound you may smile",
    "to think of the ones and zeros of that sound\ufb01le",
    "resembling sticks and drumheads,",
    "or knitting needles and drumheads",
    "as the beat gets molten.",
    "When things get molten you may think of a \ufb01re",
    "made up of a million little match\ufb01res",
    "rendering a house on the Sound",
    "A thousand hotheads make a Sarkozy:",
    "at the sight of their BMW",
    "a thousand swans make a Sigol\u00e8ne",
    "purring",
    "The Sound is statistical, like the meltdown.",
    "The holes in your socks and the follicles in your leg",
    "are pixelated as a JPEG",
    "My tastebuds resemble microscopic glasses of gin now, now\u2019s",
    "the time to shake and shiver like a maraca in this house.",
    "The many kinds of dissolution.",
    "Well, birds happen forth from feeders like swinging pagodas",
    "against snow, as",
    "the meltdown goes on, a dump of rock salt.",
    "We\u2019ll soon be signatories by default.",
    "Crystals of sodium chloride",
    "are made of smaller crystals of sodium chloride.",
    "Let them know their House",
    "is made up of many other people\u2019s houses, magni\ufb01ed."

    "Stare hard enough at the fabric of night,",
    "and if you're predisposed to dark\u2014let\u2019s say",
    "the window you\u2019ve picked is a black",
    "postage stamp you spend hours at,",
    "sleepless, drinking gin after the",
    "Lucy reruns have gone off\u2014stare",
    "like your eyes have force, and behind",
    "any night\u2019s taut scrim will come the forms",
    "you expect pressing from the other side.",
    "For you: a field of skulls, angled jaws",
    "and eye-sockets, a zillion scooped-out crania.",
    "They\u2019re plain once you think to look.",
    "You know such fields exist, for criminals",
    "roam your very block, and even history lists",
    "monsters like Adolf and Uncle Joe",
    "who stalk the earth\u2019s orb, plus minor baby-eaters",
    "unidentified, probably in your very midst. Perhaps",
    "that disgruntled mail clerk from your job",
    "has already scratched your name on a bullet\u2014that\u2019s him",
    "rustling in the azaleas. You caress the thought,",
    "for it proves there\u2019s no better spot for you",
    "than here, your square-yard of chintz sofa, hearing",
    "the bad news piped steady from your head. The night",
    "is black. You stare and furious stare,",
    "confident there are no gods out there. In this way,",
    "you\u2019re blind to your own eye\u2019s intricate machine",
    "and to the light it sees by, to the luck of birth and all",
    "your remembered loves. If the skulls are there\u2014",
    "let\u2019s say they do press toward you",
    "against night\u2019s scrim\u2014could they not stare",
    "with slack jawed envy at the fine flesh",
    "that covers your scalp, the numbered hairs,",
    "at the force your hands hold?"

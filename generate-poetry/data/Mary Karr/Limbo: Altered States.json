    "No sooner does the plane angle up",
    "than I cork off to dream a bomb blast:",
    "A fireball roiling through the cabin in slo-mo,",
    "seat blown loose from its bolts,",
    "I hang weightless a nanosecond",
    "in blue space",
    "then jerk awake to ordered rows.",
    "And there\u2019s the silver liquor cart jangling",
    "its thousand bells, the perfect doses",
    "of juniper gin and oak-flavored scotch",
    "held by a rose-nailed hand.",
    "I don\u2019t miss drinking, don\u2019t miss",
    "driving into shit with more molecular density",
    "than myself, nor the",
    "reruns I sat before, nor the dead",
    "space inside only alcohol could fill and then",
    "not even. But I miss",
    "the aftermath, the pure simplicity:",
    "mouth parched, head hissing static.",
    "How little I asked of myself then\u2014to suck",
    "the next breath, suffer the next heave, live",
    "till cocktail hour when I could mix",
    "the next sickness.",
    "I locked the bathroom door, sat",
    "on the closed commode, shirtless,",
    "in filmy underpants telling myself that death",
    "could fit my grasp and be staved off",
    "while in the smeary shaving glass,",
    "I practiced the stillness of a soul",
    "awaiting birth.",
    "For the",
    "that swarmed beyond the door",
    "I was pure scorn, dead center of my stone and starless",
    "universe, orbited by no one. Novitiate obliterate, Saint",
    "Absence, Duchess of Naught . . .",
    "A stinging ether folded me in mist.",
    "Sometimes landing the head's pressure\u2019s enormous.",
    "When my plane tilts down, houses grow large, streets",
    "lose their clear geometry. The leafy earth soon fills my portal,",
    "and in the gray graveyard of cars, a stick figure",
    "becomes my son in royal blue cap flapping his arms",
    "as if to rise. Thank god for our place",
    "in this forest of forms, for the",
    "that draws me back to him, and for how lightly",
    "lightly I touch down."

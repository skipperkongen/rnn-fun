    "On the mudroad of plodding American bodies,",
    "my son wove like an antelope from stall",
    "to stall and want to want. I no\u2019ed it all: the wind-up",
    "killer robot and winged alien; knives",
    "hierarchical in a glass case; the blow-up vinyl wolf",
    "bobbing from a pilgrim\u2019s staff.",
    "Lured as I was by the bar-b-que\u2019s black smoke,",
    "I got in line. A hog carcass,",
    "blistered pink on a spit, made its agonized slow roll,",
    "a metaphor, I thought, for anyone",
    "ahead of me\u2014the pasty-faced and broad. I half-longed",
    "for the titanium blade I\u2019d just seen",
    "curved like a falcon\u2019s claw. Some truth wanted cutting",
    "in my neighbors\u2019 impermanent flesh.",
    "Or so my poisoned soul announced, as if scorn",
    "for the body politic",
    "weren\u2019t some outward form of inner scorn,",
    "as if I were fit judge.",
    "Lucky my son found the bumper cars. Once I\u2019d hoped",
    "only to stand tall enough",
    "to drive my own. Now when the master switch got thrown",
    "and sparks skittered overhead",
    "in a lightning web, I felt like Frankenstein or some",
    "newly powered monster.",
    "Plus the floor was glossy as ice. Even rammed head-on,",
    "the rubber bumper bounced you off unhurt",
    "and into other folks who didn\u2019t mind the jolt, whose faces",
    "all broke smiles, in fact,",
    "till the perfect figure-eight I\u2019d started out to execute",
    "became itself an interruption. One face",
    "after another wheeled shining at me from the dark,",
    "each bearing the weight of a whole self.",
    "What pure vessels we are, I thought, once our skulls",
    "shut up their nasty talk.",
    "We drove home past corn at full tassel, colossal silos,",
    "a windmill sentinel. Summer was starting.",
    "My son\u2019s body slumped like a grain sack against mine.",
    "My chest was all thunder.",
    "On the purple sky in rear view, fireworks unpacked\u2014silver",
    "chrysanthemum, another in fuchsia,",
    "then plum. Each staccato boom shook the night. My son",
    "jerked in his sleep. I prayed hard to keep",
    "the frail peace we hurtled through, to want no more",
    "than what we had. The road",
    "rushed under us. Our lush planet heaved toward day.",
    "Inside my hand\u2019s flesh,",
    "anybody\u2019s skeleton gripped the wheel."

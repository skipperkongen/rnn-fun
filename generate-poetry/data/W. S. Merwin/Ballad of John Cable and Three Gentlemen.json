    "He that had come that morning,",
    "One after the other,",
    "Over seven hills,",
    "Each of a new color,",
    "Came now by the last tree,",
    "By the red-colored valley,",
    "To a gray river",
    "Wide as the sea.",
    "There at the shingle",
    "A listing wherry",
    "Awash with dark water;",
    "What should it carry?",
    "There on the shelving,",
    "Three dark gentlemen.",
    "Might they direct him?",
    "Three gentlemen.",
    "\u201cCable, friend John, John Cable,\u201d",
    "When they saw him they said,",
    "\u201cCome and be company",
    "As far as the far side.\u201d",
    "\u201cCome follow the feet,\u201d they said,",
    "\u201cOf your family,",
    "Of your old father",
    "That came already this way.\u201d",
    "But Cable said, \u201cFirst I must go",
    "Once to my sister again;",
    "What will she do come spring",
    "And no man on her garden?",
    "She will say \u2018Weeds are alive",
    "From here to the Stream of Friday;",
    "I grieve for my brother\u2019s plowing,\u2019",
    "Then break and cry.\u201d",
    "\u201cLose no sleep,\u201d they said, \u201cfor that fallow:",
    "She will say before summer,",
    "\u2018I can get me a daylong man,",
    "Do better than a brother.\u2019 \u201d",
    "Cable said, \u201cI think of my wife:",
    "Dearly she needs consoling;",
    "I must go back for a little",
    "For fear she die of grieving.\u201d",
    "\u201cCable,\u201d they said, \u201cJohn Cable,",
    "Ask no such wild favor;",
    "Still, if you fear she die soon,",
    "The boat might wait for her.\u201d",
    "But Cable said, \u201cI remember:",
    "Out of charity let me",
    "Go shore up my poorly mother,",
    "Cries all afternoon.\u201d",
    "They said, \u201cShe is old and far,",
    "Far and rheumy with years,",
    "And, if you like, we shall take",
    "No note of her tears.\u201d",
    "But Cable said, \u201cI am neither",
    "Your hired man nor maid,",
    "Your dog nor shadow",
    "Nor your ape to be led.\u201d",
    "He said, \u201cI must go back:",
    "Once I heard someone say",
    "That the hollow Stream of Friday",
    "Is a rank place to lie;",
    "And this word, now I remember,",
    "Makes me sorry: have you",
    "Thought of my own body",
    "I was always good to?",
    "The frame that was my devotion",
    "And my blessing was,",
    "The straight bole whose limbs",
    "Were long as stories\u2014",
    "Now, poor thing, left in the dirt",
    "By the Stream of Friday",
    "Might not remember me",
    "Half tenderly.\u201d",
    "They let him nurse no worry;",
    "They said, \u201cWe give you our word:",
    "Poor thing is made of patience;",
    "Will not say a word.\u201d",
    "\u201cCable, friend John, John Cable,\u201d",
    "After this they said,",
    "\u201cCome with no company",
    "To the far side.",
    "To a populous place,",
    "A dense city",
    "That shall not be changed",
    "Before much sorrow dry.\u201d",
    "Over shaking water",
    "Toward the feet of his father,",
    "Leaving the hills\u2019 color",
    "And his poorly mother",
    "And his wife at grieving",
    "And his sister\u2019s fallow",
    "And his body lying",
    "In the rank hollow,",
    "Now Cable is carried",
    "On the dark river;",
    "Nor even a shadow",
    "Followed him over.",
    "On the wide river",
    "Gray as the sea",
    "Flags of white water",
    "Are his company."

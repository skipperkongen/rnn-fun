    "Oh pile of white shirts who is coming",
    "to breathe in your shapes to carry your numbers",
    "to appear",
    "what hearts",
    "are moving toward their garments here",
    "their days",
    "what troubles beating between arms",
    "you look upward through",
    "each other saying nothing has happened",
    "and it has gone away and is sleeping",
    "having told the same story",
    "and we exist from within",
    "eyes of the gods",
    "you lie on your backs",
    "and the wounds are not made",
    "the blood has not heard",
    "the boat has not turned to stone",
    "and the dark wires to the bulb",
    "are full of the voice of the unborn"

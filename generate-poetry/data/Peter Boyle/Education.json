    "Seven years old,",
    "on loan to an uncle",
    "and a bundle of cash went missing.",
    "For three days locked in a room, beaten.",
    "The golden orbs of pennies roasted in an oven",
    "removed by tongs",
    "glisten on a child\u2019s skin",
    "as she screams and screams.",
    "These round white scars",
    "that remain even today",
    "without pigment",
    "without the shadow of colour",
    "with only the ash\u2019s afterglow.",
    "After telling that story",
    "you burnt your hand on the iron,",
    "burnt it yourself,",
    "your punishment for breaking silence.",
    "You rushed to the balcony but they pulled you back inside.",
    "You wanted to spit, to scream insults at the soldiers",
    "to stop them beating up the old man in the street.",
    "\u201cListen,\u201d she said as she held you back, your mother.",
    "\u201cListen, you have to learn to say nothing.\u201d",
    "Learn to be nobody.",
    "Learn to be the white wall",
    "that has no face and no tongue."

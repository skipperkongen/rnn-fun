    "Laid out flat",
    "in the back of the station wagon my father borrowed",

    "the leaves are immense,",
    "green and golden with clear summer light",
    "breaking through \u2013",
    "though I turn only my neck",

    "along this avenue that has no limits.",
    "What does it matter",
    "that I am only eyes",
    "if I am to be carried",
    "so lightly",
    "under the trees of the world?",
    "From beyond the numbness of my strange body",
    "the wealth of the leaves",
    "falls forever",
    "into my small still watching."

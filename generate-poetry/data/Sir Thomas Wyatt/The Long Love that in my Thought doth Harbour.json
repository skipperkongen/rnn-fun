    "The long\u00eb love that in my thought doth harbour",
    "And in mine hert doth keep his residence,",
    "Into my face presseth with bold pretence",
    "And therein campeth, spreading his banner.",
    "She that me learneth to love and suffer",
    "And will that my trust and lust\u00ebs negligence",
    "Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,",
    "With his hardiness taketh displeasure.",
    "Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,",
    "Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,",
    "And there him hideth and not appeareth.",
    "What may I do when my master feareth",
    "But in the field with him to live and die?",
    "For good is the life ending faithfully."

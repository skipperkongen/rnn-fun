    "My galley, charg\u00e8d with forgetfulness,",
    "Thorough sharp seas in winter nights doth pass",
    "'Tween rock and rock; and eke mine en'my, alas,",
    "That is my lord, steereth with cruelness;",
    "And every owre a thought in readiness,",
    "As though that death were light in such a case.",
    "An endless wind doth tear the sail apace",
    "Of forced sighs and trusty fearfulness.",
    "A rain of tears, a cloud of dark disdain,",
    "Hath done the weared cords great hinderance;",
    "Wreath\u00e8d with error and eke with ignorance.",
    "The stars be hid that led me to this pain;",
    "Drown\u00e8d is Reason that should me comfort,",
    "And I remain despairing of the port."

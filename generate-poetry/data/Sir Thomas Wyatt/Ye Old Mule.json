    "Ye old mule that think yourself so fair,",

    "For it is true, without any fable,",
    "No man setteth more by riding in your saddle.",
    "Too much travail so do your train appair.",
    "Ye old mule",
    "With false savour though you deceive th'air,",
    "Whoso taste you shall well perceive your lair",
    "Savoureth somewhat of a Kappurs stable.",
    "Ye old mule",
    "Ye must now serve to market and to fair,",
    "All for the burden, for panniers a pair.",
    "For since gray hairs been powdered in your sable,",
    "The thing ye seek for, you must yourself enable",
    "To purchase it by payment and by prayer,",
    "Ye old mule."

    "Stand whoso list upon the slipper top",
    "Of court\u2019s estates, and let me here rejoice;",
    "And use me quiet without let or stop,",
    "Unknown in court, that hath such brackish joys:",
    "In hidden place, so let my days forth pass,",
    "That when my years be done, withouten noise,",
    "I may die ag\u00e8d after the common trace,",
    "For him death gripeth right hard by the crope",
    "That is much known of other; and of himself alas,",
    "Doth die unknown, dazed with dreadful face."

    "I am of them that farthest cometh behind.",

    "Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore",
    "Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,",
    "Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.",
    "Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,",
    "As well as I may spend his time in vain.",
    "And graven with diamonds in letters plain",
    "There is written, her fair neck round about:",
    ", for Caesar's I am,",
    "And wild for to hold, though I seem tame."

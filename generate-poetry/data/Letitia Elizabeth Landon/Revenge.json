    "Ay, gaze upon her rose-wreathed hair,",
    "And gaze upon her smile;",
    "Seem as you drank the very air",
    "Her breath perfumed the while:",

    "That wild and witching lay,",
    "And swear your heart is as a shrine,",

    "Mark you that scornful cheek,\u2014",
    "The eye averted as you pass\u2019d,",
    "Spoke more than words could speak.",
    "Ay, now by all the bitter tears",
    "That I have shed for thee,\u2014",
    "The racking doubts, the burning fears,\u2014",
    "Avenged they well may be\u2014",
    "By the nights pass\u2019d in sleepless care,",

    "All that you taught my heart to bear,",
    "All that yourself will know.",
    "I would not wish to see you laid",
    "Within an early tomb;",
    "I should forget how you betray\u2019d,",
    "And only weep your doom:",
    "But this is fitting punishment,",
    "To live and love in vain,\u2014",
    "Oh my wrung heart, be thou content,",
    "And feed upon his pain.",
    "Go thou and watch her lightest sigh,\u2014",
    "Thine own it will not be;",
    "And bask beneath her sunny eye,\u2014",
    "It will not turn on thee.",
    "\u2019Tis well: the rack, the chain, the wheel,",
    "Far better hadst thou proved;",
    "Ev\u2019n I could almost pity feel,",
    "For thou art nor beloved."

    "On the volatile nights of a winter",
    "nature corroborates with magnanimity",
    "a Cuban is in training for amusement or amnesia,",
    "so often and unfairly assumed as the same,",
    "he brings candy to God, he cultivates the vernacular, he fights off",
    "cirrhosis with fruit poached in syrup, he conducts business;",
    "thus research has shown that The Cuban is resourceful.",
    "In the weighty choreographies of a summer",
    "nature authorizes already with suspicion",
    "a Cuban meets the ocean with offerings and harpoons,",
    "so often and unfairly assumed as the same,",
    "he finger-counts the casualties, he commits an infraction",
    "he slides his hands into his pockets, he avows and commits;",
    "thus analysis has shown that The Cuban is inspired.",
    "Let\u2019s attend the improbable territory",
    "where with pasty mouths a Cuban and The Cuban engage in virile",
    "conversation",
    "we will learn there by what voyage, by what strange condition",
    "by what exchange",
    "we fall prey to so much ingenuity."

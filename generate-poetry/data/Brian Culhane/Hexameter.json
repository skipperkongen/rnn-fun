    "Hold, memory, a vision out of Greece:",
    "The west wind breathes a ripening breath",
    "As each pear, pendant and golden, brushes",
    "Another, where four tilled acres glisten",
    "Winter and summer: fig, olive, currant,",
    "And the heavy succulent pomegranate",
    "\u2014Sunstruck for the plucker\u2019s hand.",
    "All this a stranger sees, palm on lintel,",
    "Sees the stately women of the royal rooms",
    "Murmuring over linen, looms humming;",
    "Sees boys, on pedestals, shine torches",
    "Which fire the eyes of Alkin\u00f6os\u2019s hounds.",
    "So much of heroism wondrously found",
    "(Like a glinting pebble in a child\u2019s hand,",
    "Borne upward to imagination\u2019s shallows),",
    "As I\u2019d gaze at snow blanketing West End,",
    "Hearing the story my father burnished",
    "Over a month of nights, so that the voyage",
    "Of the telling faded into the hours lived",
    "Beside that voice\u2014whiskey rough\u2014again",
    "Taking up the exile\u2019s lament:",
    "Distaff, honeyed wine . . . Some bleary god",
    "Come down from heaven\u2019s height, as snow",
    "Descends on elms and, beyond our window,",
    "Odysseus, beggared and unknown, moves",
    "Toward the great bow of gnarled revenge.",
    "Pitch pine torches reveal a stranger\u2019s son",
    "Holding still-thrumming wood in his hand."

    "For hours now the Last Supper has been over,",
    "And the beating almost over, and morning\u2019s cry",
    "Yet to be heard by the workmen in the courtyard",
    "Warming themselves by the hasty fire, and Peter,",
    "Near the agony in the garden, feeling something",
    "Terrible happening, blinking back stale sleep,",
    "Peter turns his face from strangers\u2019 stares.",
    "\u201cThis man also was with Jesus.\u201d The others",
    "Slowly turning toward him with cold interest,",
    "And his own voice, thick-tongued: \u201cI do not know him.\u201d",
    "That the cock crows not then but at the third",
    "Must tell us much about the nature of faith,",
    "How it leans on separations, how it robes simple",
    "Gestures\u2014a hand waving from an open window\u2014",
    "With deferral, as if real knowledge only comes after,",
    "As though Peter could only see what he\u2019d done",
    "Upon going from the high priest\u2019s courtyard",
    "And, all alone, weeping bitterly in the dawn.",
    "That much we can understand, but why then",
    "Does Chekhov revisit this known, hard ground",
    "With a half-frozen student who, on his way back",
    "From a failed hunt, thinks how this same chill",
    "Easter wind must have blown in Rurik\u2019s age",
    "And scourged the hungry poor in the years",
    "Of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible?",
    "Wind, raw wind, hunger, icy needles of rain . . .",
    "The same as then\u2014until, coming on two widows,",
    "A huge, shapeless old woman in a man\u2019s overcoat",
    "And her putty-faced daughter washing a kettle,",
    "The student asks if he might share their fire,",
    "Saying, as he does, that St. Peter had on such",
    "A night warmed himself before a fire, on such",
    "A cold, extraordinarily long and terrible night.",
    "Murmuring welcomes, they bring him inside,",
    "And soon he finds himself describing in detail",
    "That part of the gospel which is Peter\u2019s betrayal:",
    "\u201c. . . thus I imagine it: the garden deathly still",
    "And very dark, and in the silence came",
    "Sounds of muffled sobbing\u2014\u201d Here his account",
    "Breaks off when the absently-smiling Vasilissa",
    "Suddenly weeps, burying her eyes in her apron;",
    "Whereupon her daughter, herself bowed down",
    "By sickness and filth, blushes and turns away.",
    "The student, for all his theology, is speechless.",
    "There\u2019s nothing for it now but to step out",
    "With empty game-bag and find his moonlit",
    "Way back home across the ancient marsh.",
    "Only then does he see in the waterlogged",
    "Meadow, well beyond the river\u2019s sedges,",
    "Something remarkable: a high-walled garden",
    "Looming green against a background of sand.",
    "Nineteen hundred years crossed in heartbeats!",
    "In that kindled instant all the world\u2019s travails",
    "Drop from his shoulders. Just twenty-two,",
    "He has found the very quick of faith.",
    "Gone are hunger, sleet and useless words. Gone!",
    "Ah, we leave him there at century\u2019s end,",
    "Before he has returned to his village",
    "\u2014And all that returning would surely mean\u2014",
    "In this, the briefest of the master\u2019s stories."

    "Virgin, sappy, gorgeous, the right-now",
    "Flutters its huge prosthetics at us, flung",
    "To the spotlights, frozen in motion, center-ice.",
    "And the first rows, shaken with an afterslice",
    "That\u2019s bowled them into their seats like a big wet ciao.",
    "O daffy panoply O rare device",
    "O flashing leg-iron at a whopping price",
    "Whipping us into ecstasies and how,",
    "The whole galumphing Garden swung and swung,",
    "A rescue helicopter\u2019s bottom rung",
    "Glinting and spinning off, a scud of fluff,",
    "A slash of petals up against the bough,",
    "A juggler\u2019s avalanche of silken stuff",
    "Gushing in white-hot verticals among",
    "Camels and axels and pyramids, oh wow,",
    "Bewilderment is parachute enough.",
    "We jolt. A sidewise stutterstep in chorus.",
    "The other billboards flicker by before us.",
    "Gone! with a budded petulance that stung.",
    "So talented! So targeted! So young!",
    "Such concentration on the bottom line!",
    "We vanish down the IRT. A shine.",
    "A glimmer. Something. Nothing. To think twice",
    "Was to have lost the trick of paradise."

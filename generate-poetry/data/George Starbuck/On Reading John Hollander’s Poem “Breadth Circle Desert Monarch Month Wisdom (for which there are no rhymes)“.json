    "\u201cBreadth. Circle. Desert. Monarch. Month. Wisdom. (",
    "No rhymes)\u201d was just the title, and I only read that far.",
    "That was because I felt like some old agent-of-the-Czar",
    "When a new plotter swims within the scope of his exertions,",
    "And I was scared this hothead would start hedging his assertions",
    "Before I had him dead-to-rights. (A Chekan\u2019s or a SMERSHian\u2019s",
    "Lot, you know, is not an happy one.) He might retract.",
    "A liar is a liar is a liar. That\u2019s his act.",
    "But six distinct demonstrable defiances-of-fact",
    "Before he hits line one? That\u2019s taking aim at the World\u2019s Record.",
    "I wanted this quark-colored tangerine-flake double-deckered",
    "Omnibus of absurdities to make it to the checkered",
    "Flag. He had started fast, but could he forge on? Was he",
    "?",
    "He had the Grand Prix style all right. Intense. Composed. Imperious.",
    "And lies to burn. Poor lies, in no wise deep or deleterious.",
    "He drove them home like thumb (or rather tooth nail fist and chin) tacks.",
    "He planted Cosmic Glints to make you whimper for a glint-axe.",
    "\u201cUnconstellated words rain down ... inexorable syntax\u201d",
    "Etcetera etcetera.",
    "It\u2019s not that I\u2019d set up,",
    "Like Carrie Nation beating back the drunkard from his cup,",
    "To scourge the world of liars. I\u2019d as soon be Offissa Pup.",
    "I\u2019d sooner hassle fetishists and call myself a bra-narc.",
    "If I were Lord of All (or even constitutional monarch)",
    "I\u2019d send a Deluge down, with one-way tickets on the Non-ark",
    "For lying priests and pedagogues. They make a feller\u2019s fez hurt.",
    "But whom does Keats\u2019s whopper about corpulent Cortez hurt?",
    "Or any poet\u2019s whopper? If he wants to say the Desert",
    "Is made of pea-green Camembert, hell, welcome to the circle.",
    "We listen to a Bard the way a certain kind of jerk\u2019ll",
    "Listen to leaves or listen to a percolator perkle.",
    "As long as he can grind em out, a dozen-or-so a month,",
    "We\u2019ll praise him to the nth degree, and to the n-plus-1",
    "He could have called the thing \u201cFifth. Sixth. Eighth. Ninth. Twelfth. Baker\u2019s dozenth\u201d",
    "For all we care. We\u2019ll cheer him to the w-x-y-zedth",
    "As long as his flimflammeries have brio and have breadth",
    "And don\u2019t come on like nursery-nannies pushing early-to-bedth",
    "To three-year-olds with jingles about Health and Wealth and Wisdom.",
    "He should look out, though. He might take himself in, and that is dumb.",
    "Do that, and sure as malheur is the better part of Msdom,",
    "Sententiousness will sidle in with snapshots in his wallet",
    "To lay a little something on us camels: some small strawlet",
    "Of Wisdom, say, or Beauty. Take this poem now. I call it",
    "\u201cWidth. Rhombus. (see Lozenge.) Glacier. Despot. Fortnight. Bilge.\u201d",
    "I",
    "myself: \u201cNo overkill. Go easy on the bilge.\u201d",
    "But then.",
    "is human. And what rhymes with bilge is bilge."

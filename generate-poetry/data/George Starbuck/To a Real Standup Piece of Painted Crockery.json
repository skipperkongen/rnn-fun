    "I wonder what the Greeks kept in these comicstrip canisters.",
    "Plums, milletseed, incense, henna, oregano.",
    "Speak to me, trove. Tell me you contained dried smoked tongue once.",
    "Or a sorcerer or a cosmetologist\u2019s powders and unguents.",
    "And when John Keats looked at you in a collection of pots",
    "it was poetry at first sight: quotable beautiful",
    "teleological concatenations of thoughts.",
    "It\u2019s the proverbial dog of a poem, though:",
    "slobbering panting and bright-eyed like a loquacious thug",
    "or a spokesperson embattled on behalf of a sociopolitical thesis",
    "to which he has not had access owing to the need-to-know basis.",
    "And he never says which pot. Just an oasis",
    "of tease in a sea of tilth, kind of a concrete catachresis",
    "bopping along with timbrels, irrepressible as Count Basie,",
    "fabulous I mean classic I mean vout,",
    "keeping the buckwheat in and the weevils out",
    "while the rest of us get and spend and ache and earn",
    "and go to the Bruce Springsteen concert and take our turn",
    "lining up at the Metropolitan to look at the Macedonian gold krater",
    "and promising ourselves to read up seriously."

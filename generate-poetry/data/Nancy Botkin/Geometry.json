    "All the roofs sloped at the same angle.",
    "The distance between the houses was the same.",
    "There were so many feet from each front door",
    "to the curb. My father mowed the lawn",
    "straight up and down and then diagonally.",
    "And then he lined up beer bottles on the kitchen table.",
    "We knew them only in summer when the air",
    "passed through the screens. The neighbor girls",
    "talked to us across the great divide: attic window",
    "to attic window. We started with our names.",
    "Our whispers wobbled along a tightrope,",
    "and below was the rest of our lives."

    "Saved two children last night.",

    "one gone blue, the other grey.",
    "I laid them out on grass",
    "that snapped under my step",
    "wrung their bodies warm and dry",
    "gave them the gust of my breath.",
    "Then I looked out at the morning",
    "that lay lukewarm on the water",
    "put on a tank top",
    "arranged some grasses in a vase",
    "fished two children out of sleep."

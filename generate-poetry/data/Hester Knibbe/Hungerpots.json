    "Did an argument break out in the kitchen that morning?",
    "Was there smashing of pots and pans: you",
    "want to eat somewhere else? Go on,",
    "get out! Or were they set outside, shrewd,",
    "meant to feed on dust and hunger or to tempt the doves",
    "of peace? Nothing wrong with that as long as",
    "the cook stays put by another fire. Hollow",
    "vessels on grass socks, what do they want from this",
    "puzzle of trees and clouds? Even the wind",
    "seems to have forgotten how to whistle and wherever",
    "you look, those who are gone cannot be seen.",
    "They\u2019re steeped to their lips in bronzed silence. O",
    "let their bellies chime like clocks, whack",
    "with ladles and sticks, drive devilish",
    "death out of those pots!"

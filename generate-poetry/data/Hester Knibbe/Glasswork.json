    "my love who shelters in his words",
    "sometimes falls silent for a sudden eternity",
    "breathes that silence into a bell of glass",
    "in which he calms storms",
    "he draws lee lines in what was",
    "it\u2019s more like a firefirm crackling",
    "when he takes up words with ease",
    "in a single glance, caressing my body",
    "I read him day and night. What will it be like",
    "when he withdraws into the word",
    "arranges a last room, silver-white,",
    "pushes the furniture a bit closer together",
    "and crams still more fragile glass inside\u2014",
    "what will it be like when he grows transparent and breaks"

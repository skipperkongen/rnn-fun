    "I\u2019ve stayed in the front yard all my life.",
    "I want a peek at the back",
    "Where it\u2019s rough and untended and hungry weed grows.",
    "A girl gets sick of a rose.",
    "I want to go in the back yard now",
    "And maybe down the alley,",
    "To where the charity children play.",
    "I want a good time today.",
    "They do some wonderful things.",
    "They have some wonderful fun.",
    "My mother sneers, but I say it\u2019s fine",
    "How they don\u2019t have to go in at quarter to nine.",
    "My mother, she tells me that Johnnie Mae",
    "Will grow up to be a bad woman.",
    "That George\u2019ll be taken to Jail soon or late",
    "(On account of last winter he sold our back gate).",
    "But I say it\u2019s fine. Honest, I do.",
    "And I\u2019d like to be a bad woman, too,",
    "And wear the brave stockings of night-black lace",
    "And strut down the streets with paint on my face."

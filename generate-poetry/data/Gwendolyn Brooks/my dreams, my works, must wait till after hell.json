    "I hold my honey and I store my bread",
    "In little jars and cabinets of my will.",
    "I label clearly, and each latch and lid",
    "I bid, Be firm till I return from hell.",
    "I am very hungry. I am incomplete.",
    "And none can tell when I may dine again.",
    "No man can give me any word but Wait,",
    "The puny light. I keep eyes pointed in;",
    "Hoping that, when the devil days of my hurt",
    "Drag out to their last dregs and I resume",
    "On such legs as are left me, in such heart",
    "As I can manage, remember to go home,",
    "My taste will not have turned insensitive",
    "To honey and bread old purity could love."

    "Mrs. Coley\u2019s three-flat brick",
    "Isn\u2019t here any more.",
    "All done with seeing her fat little form",
    "Burst out of the basement door;",
    "And with seeing her African son-in-law",
    "(Rightful heir to the throne)",
    "With his great white strong cold squares of teeth",
    "And his little eyes of stone;",
    "And with seeing the squat fat daughter",
    "Letting in the men",
    "When majesty has gone for the day\u2014",
    "And letting them out again."

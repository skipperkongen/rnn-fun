    "Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand",
    "Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore",
    "Alone upon the threshold of my door",
    "Of individual life, I shall command",
    "The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand",
    "Serenely in the sunshine as before,",
    "Without the sense of that which I forbore, ..",
    "Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land",
    "Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine",
    "With pulses that beat double. What I do",
    "And what I dream include thee, as the wine",
    "Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue",
    "God for myself, He hears that name of thine,",
    "And sees within my eyes, the tears of two."

    "When our two souls stand up erect and strong,",
    "Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,",
    "Until the lengthening wings break into fire",
    "At either curv\u00e9d point, \u2014 what bitter wrong",
    "Can the earth do to us, that we should not long",
    "Be here contented ? Think. In mounting higher,",
    "The angels would press on us, and aspire",
    "To drop some golden orb of perfect song",
    "Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay",
    "Rather on earth, Belov\u00e8d, \u2014 where the unfit",
    "Contrarious moods of men recoil away",
    "And isolate pure spirits, and permit",
    "A place to stand and love in for a day,",
    "With darkness and the death-hour rounding it."

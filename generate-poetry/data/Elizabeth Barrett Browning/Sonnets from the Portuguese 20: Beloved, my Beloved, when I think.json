    "Beloved, my Beloved, when I think",
    "That thou wast in the world a year ago,",
    "What time I sate alone here in the snow",
    "And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink",
    "No moment at thy voice ... but, link by link,",
    "Went counting all my chains, as if that so",
    "They never could fall off at any blow",
    "Struck by thy possible hand ... why, thus I drink",
    "Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful,",
    "Never to feel thee thrill the day or night",
    "With personal act or speech,\u2014nor ever cull",
    "Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white",
    "Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull,",
    "Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight."

    "Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers",
    "Plucked in the garden, all the summer through",
    "And winter, and it seemed as if they grew",
    "In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers,",
    "So, in the like name of that love of ours,",
    "Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,",
    "And which on warm and cold days I withdrew",
    "From my heart\u2019s ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers",
    "Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,",
    "And wait thy weeding; yet here\u2019s eglantine,",
    "Here\u2019s ivy!\u2014 take them, as I used to do",
    "Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.",
    "Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,",
    "And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine."

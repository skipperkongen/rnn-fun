    "MY future will not copy fair my past",
    "On any leaf but Heaven's. Be fully done,",
    "Supernal Will ! I would not fain be one",
    "Who, satisfying thirst and breaking fast",
    "Upon the fulness of the heart, at last",
    "Saith no grace after meat. My wine hath run",
    "Indeed out of my cup, and there is none",
    "To gather up the bread of my repast",
    "Scattered and trampled ! Yet I find some good",
    "In earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble up",
    "Clear from the darkling ground, \u0097 content until",
    "I sit with angels before better food.",
    "Dear Christ ! when thy new vintage fills my cup,",
    "This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill."

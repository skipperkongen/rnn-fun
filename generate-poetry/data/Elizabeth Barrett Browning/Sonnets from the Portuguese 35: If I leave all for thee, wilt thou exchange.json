    "Of walls and floors ... another home than this?",
    "Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is",
    "Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change?",
    "That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,",
    "To conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove;",
    "For grief indeed is love and grief beside.",
    "Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.",
    "Yet love me\u2014wilt thou? Open thine heart wide,",
    "And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove."

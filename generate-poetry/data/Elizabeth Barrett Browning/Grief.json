    "I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;",
    "That only men incredulous of despair,",
    "Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air",
    "Beat upward to God\u2019s throne in loud access",
    "Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,",
    "In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare",
    "Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare",
    "Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express",
    "Grief for thy dead in silence like to death\u2014",
    "Most like a monumental statue set",
    "In everlasting watch and moveless woe",
    "Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.",
    "Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:",
    "If it could weep, it could arise and go."

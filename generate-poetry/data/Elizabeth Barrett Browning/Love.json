    "We cannot live, except thus mutually",
    "We alternate, aware or unaware,",
    "The reflex act of life: and when we bear",
    "Our virtue onward most impulsively,",
    "Most full of invocation, and to be",
    "Most instantly compellant, certes, there",
    "We live most life, whoever breathes most air",
    "And counts his dying years by sun and sea.",
    "But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth",
    "Throw out her full force on another soul,",
    "The conscience and the concentration both",
    "Make mere life, Love. For Life in perfect whole",
    "And aim consummated, is Love in sooth,",
    "As nature\u2019s magnet-heat rounds pole with pole."

    "When the wind invades the treetops",
    "and the trees agree, shivering",
    "take me, take me, when their",
    "stealthy perfume drifts down to waft",
    "among mortals, they come out in droves:",
    "the boy whose bouncing keys speak a language",
    "all their own, the novice who gets her tricks",
    "from magazine molls (their haughtiness, swirl",
    "of cleats), the gigolo with eyes lowered,",
    "the better to judge his prey, the woman",
    "whose hemlines rise as her age does,",
    "the bad girl whose only remaining option",
    "is to get worse: despite the string of cheats",
    "and lukewarm reactions, she still has",
    "the power to pound, the knack of",
    "funneling her frustration into",
    "the arrogant click of a heel . . .",
    "at this armada of proud, unyielding soldiers",
    "I have cast ferocious stones, holding forth",
    "on barricaded gardens and souls\u2019 communion",
    "until, heaving my bones from garret to gutter",
    "I took to the street and saw it, too, was worthy.",
    "Chasers out for a good time, flirters in",
    "for a life\u2019s catch, strutters so skilled your",
    "lurid designs burn holes, kill the cold",
    "in the pavement, it does not matter",
    "what fever you feed, so long as",
    "you feed it freely; I hid my eyes",
    "but sickness is catching; lovers, permit me entrance."

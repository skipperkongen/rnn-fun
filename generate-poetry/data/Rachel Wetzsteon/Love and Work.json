    "In an uncurtained room across the way",
    "a woman in a tight dress paints her lips",
    "a deeper red, and sizes up her hips",
    "for signs of ounces gained since yesterday.",
    "She has a thoughtful and a clever face,",
    "but she is also smart enough to know",
    "the truth: however large the brain may grow,",
    "the lashes and the earrings must keep pace.",
    "Although I\u2019ve spread my books in front of me",
    "with a majestic air of",
    "I\u2019m much less confident than I\u2019d prefer,",
    "and now I\u2019ve started pacing nervously.",
    "I\u2019m poring over theorems, tomes and tracts.",
    "I\u2019m getting ready for a heavy date",
    "by staying up ridiculously late.",
    "But a small voice advises, Face the facts:",
    "go on this way and you\u2019ll soon come to harm.",
    "The world\u2019s most famous scholars wander down",
    "the most appalling alleyways in town,",
    "a blond and busty airhead on each arm.",
    "There is an inner motor known as lust",
    "that makes a man of learning walk a mile",
    "to gratify his raging senses, while",
    "the woman he can talk to gathers dust.",
    "A chilling vision of the years ahead",
    "invades my thoughts, and widens like a stain:",
    "a barren dance card and a teeming brain,",
    "a crowded bookcase and an empty bed...",
    "What if I compromised? I\u2019d stay up late",
    "to hone my elocutionary skills,",
    "and at the crack of dawn I\u2019d swallow pills",
    "to calm my temper and control my weight,",
    "but I just can\u2019t. Romantics, so far gone",
    "they think their lovers live for wisdom, woo",
    "by growing wiser; when I think of you",
    "I find the nearest lamp and turn it on.",
    "Great gods of longing, watch me as I work",
    "and if I sprout a martyr\u2019s smarmy grin",
    "please find some violent way to do me in;",
    "I\u2019m burning all these candles not to shirk",
    "a night of passion, but to give that night",
    "a richly textured backdrop when it comes.",
    "The girl who gets up from her desk and dumbs",
    "her discourse down has never seen the flight",
    "of wide-eyed starlings from their shabby cage;",
    "the fool whose love is truest is the one",
    "who knows a lover\u2019s work is never done.",
    "I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019ve finished one more page."

    "I hate the travel logs that tell you",
    "more about the pain than the place,",
    "yet here I am again, narrating",
    "the same old story to myself",
    "time after time. The papers circling",
    "in an alley, watched by a hunchback,",
    "mimic my plans and their preventer;",
    "when an old man treats the drycleaner",
    "to a lengthy sermon on spotting,",
    "I collect it; bloated clouds spell",
    "messages that people stopped hearing",
    "long ago, and as for the hag",
    "who runs at me, arms open, mouth bleeding?",
    "She\u2019s my future, my terrible double.",
    "Always I head out, hot for details,",
    "and always the details start revolving",
    "around brave ing\u00e9nues who put their",
    "innocent hands in wicked bonfires.",
    "I could never go for ten minutes",
    "without seeing fissures as faces,",
    "and I confess a hopeless weakness",
    "for the types who come back from travels,",
    "gather their fans around and tell them",
    "stories of order or of wonder:",
    "seashores and meadows sometimes get so",
    "muffled and many-voiced that tourists",
    "storm in and do their talking for them\u2014",
    "It\u2019s addictive, magical, vital.",
    "But I\u2019ve observed how, more and more, these",
    "promising outings are becoming",
    "meta-walks and mechanized phrases:",
    "\u201cWhen I ventured into the outback,",
    "how it blared back echoes of me,",
    "my bright dreams and tragic uniqueness.\u201d",
    "Meanwhile forces of good and evil",
    "squirm and flourish under the carpet,",
    "mocking the visionary moment\u2019s",
    "sweeping appeal. I\u2019ll go on going",
    "out for scenes of horror and pleasure,",
    "but I\u2019ll start pursuing clues leading",
    "to the return of that enormous,",
    "fertile ground between shouting and silence."

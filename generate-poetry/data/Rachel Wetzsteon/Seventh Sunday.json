    "Since you were not Hume\u2019s sunrise",
    "I watch the late-May moonrise alone",
    "and a nicotine trance assures me",
    "that summer is coming, and the arrival",
    "of painted toenails; that at last",
    "I truly understand aubades",
    "and James Stewart\u2019s vacant hospital gaze",
    "after his wits have vanished with his love;",
    "that the transmigration of bruises",
    "from skin to spirit brings about",
    "such splendid depths of character",
    "you\u2019ll drop a dime and never hear a sound.",
    "Clouds race across the moon\u2019s pale face.",
    "I have character to spare, it is",
    "no comfort; I will write us down,",
    "making nothing happen, it won\u2019t repair",
    "this ache of failed induction, these eye",
    "that live for sunlight, though the sky stays dark."

    "According to the internet",
    "tutorial, the fact that photons",
    "turn into tiny loyal billiard balls",
    "as soon as we start watching suggests",
    "no error of method",
    "or measurement, but rather,",
    "as far as anyone can tell,",
    "an invisibly unstable world,",
    "a shaking everywhere",
    "that seeing must pin down and fix.",
    "So, that morning I stumbled on you",
    "out, alone, bending through",
    "the traffic at Orange and Edwards Streets:",
    "a someone else then",
    "whom I, alone,",
    "can never otherwise see \u2014",
    "there has to be a kind of speech",
    "beyond naming, or even praise,",
    "a discipline",
    "that locates light and lets it go."

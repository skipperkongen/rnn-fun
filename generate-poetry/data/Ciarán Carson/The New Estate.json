    "You remember the rolled gold of cornfields,",
    "Their rustling of tinsel in the wind,",
    "A whole field quivering like blown silk?",
    "A shiver now runs through the laurel hedge,",
    "And washing flutters like the swaying lines",
    "Of a new verse. The high fidelity",

    "Dedication to a life of loving",
    "Money. What could they be for, those marble",
    "Toilet fixtures, the silence of water-beds,",
    "That book of poems you bought yesterday?"

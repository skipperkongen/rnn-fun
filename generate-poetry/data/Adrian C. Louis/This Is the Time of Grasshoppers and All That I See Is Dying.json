    "The grasshoppers are destroying",
    "our yard and they\u2019re as big as",
    "my middle finger saluting God.",
    "The grass is yellow. The trees",

    "but it\u2019s only the jaw-work of those",
    "drab armored insects who dance",
    "in profusion and pure destruction.",

    "of one such funnel surrounded by",
    "a circle of tiny stones in the sand,",

    "and found I could re-create",
    "a hell of my own accord.",

    "made me cruel early on.",
    "The next summer while digging",
    "postholes I found a cache of",

    "we called Children of the Earth",
    "so I piled matches atop them",
    "and barbecued their ugliness.",
    "I was at war with insects.",
    "In my fifteenth summer I got",
    "covered with ticks in the sagebrush",
    "and that fall I nervously lost my cherry",
    "in a cathouse called the Green Front",
    "and got cursed with crabs but that\u2019s",
    "not what I want to sing about",
    "at all\u2026 come on now.",
    "This is only misdirection,",
    "a sleight of hand upon the keys",
    "and the unholy replay of just",
    "one hour in some nearly",
    "forgotten time and place",
    "that I\u2019d like to return to",
    "will remain myth or maybe",
    "a holy, tumescent mystery.",

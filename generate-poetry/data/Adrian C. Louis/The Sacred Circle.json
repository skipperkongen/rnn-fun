    "Grandfather, grant me the grace",
    "of a new song far from this lament",
    "of lame words and fossils of a losing game.",
    "No more flat pebbles skimmed between the wetness",
    "of tongue and thigh and eye again!",
    "I never asked to be the son of a stained mattress",
    "who contemplated venison stew and knew",
    "the shame hidden in grease clouds stuck to the wall",
    "behind the woodstove where Grandmother cooked.",
    "I only wanted to run far, so far from Indian land.",
    "And, God damn it, when I was old enough I did.",
    "I loitered in some great halls of ivy",
    "and allowed the inquisition of education:",
    "electric cattle prods placed lovingly",
    "to the lobes of my earth memories.",
    "I carried the false spirit force of sadness",
    "wrapped in a brown sack in the pocket",
    "of a worn, tweed coat.",
    "In junkie alleyways I whispered of forgotten arrows",
    "in the narrow passages of my own discarded history.",
    "Then, when I was old enough",
    "I ran back to Indian land.",
    "Now I\u2019m thinking of running from here.",
    "Pine Ridge, South Dakota",
    "February 1988"

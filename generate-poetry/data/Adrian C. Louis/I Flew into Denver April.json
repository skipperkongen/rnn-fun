    "I flew into Denver April.",
    "Rock salt and sand peppered the asphalt",
    "reflecting myself on a downtown street",
    "where I\u2019d paused on my route to smell lilacs.",
    "The wanton winds chortled wickedly",
    "over remnant snows in gray clumps of doom",
    "and my heart soared gladly at winter\u2019s death",
    "but an hour later I had whiskey breath",
    "at a dead end bar full of Indians.",
    "A Winnebago woman waltzed with me",
    "and told me how handsome I truly was",
    "so I bought her drinks and felt her hips",
    "and somewhere between the grinds",
    "and dips she lifted my wallet and split."

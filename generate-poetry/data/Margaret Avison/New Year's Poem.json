    "The Christmas twigs crispen and needles rattle",
    "Along the window-ledge.",
    "A solitary pearl",
    "Shed from the necklace spilled at last week\u2019s party",
    "Lies in the suety, snow-luminous plainness",
    "Of morning, on the window-ledge beside them.",
    "And all the furniture that circled stately",
    "And hospitable when these rooms were brimmed",
    "With perfumes, furs, and black-and-silver",
    "Crisscross of seasonal conversation, lapses",
    "Into its previous largeness.",
    "I remember",
    "Anne\u2019s rose-sweet gravity, and the stiff grave",
    "Where cold so little can contain;",
    "I mark the queer delightful skull and crossbones",
    "Starlings and sparrows left, taking the crust,",
    "And the long loop of winter wind",
    "Smoothing its arc from dark Arcturus down",
    "To the bricked corner of the drifted courtyard,",
    "And the still window-ledge.",
    "Gentle and just pleasure",
    "It is, being human, to have won from space",
    "This unchill, habitable interior",
    "Which mirrors quietly the light",
    "Of the snow, and the new year."

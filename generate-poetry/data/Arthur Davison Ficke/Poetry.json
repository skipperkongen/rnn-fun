    "I",
    "It is a little isle amid bleak seas\u2014",
    "An isolate realm of garden, circled round",
    "By importunity of stress and sound,",
    "Devoid of empery to master these.",
    "At most, the memory of its streams and bees,",
    "Borne to the toiling mariner outward\u2014bound,",
    "Recalls his soul to that delightful ground;",
    "But serves no beacon toward his destinies.",
    "It is a refuge from the stormy days,",
    "Breathing the peace of a remoter world",
    "Where beauty, like the musing dusk of even,",
    "Enfolds the spirit in its silver haze;",
    "While far away, with glittering banners furled,",
    "The west lights fade, and stars come out in heaven.",
    "II",
    "It is a sea\u2014gate, trembling with the blast",
    "Of powers that from the infinite sea\u2014plain roll,",
    "A whelming tide. Upon the waiting soul",
    "As on a fronting rock, thunders the vast",
    "Groundswell; its spray bursts heavenward, and drives past",
    "In fume and sound articulate of the whole",
    "Of ocean\u2019s heart, else voiceless; on the shoal",
    "Silent; upon the headland clear at last.",
    "From darkened sea\u2014coasts without stars or sun,",
    "Like trumpet\u2014voices in a holy war,",
    "Utter the heralds tidings of the deep.",
    "And where men slumber, weary and undone,",
    "Visions shall come, incredible hopes from far,\u2014",
    "And with high passion shatter the bonds of sleep."

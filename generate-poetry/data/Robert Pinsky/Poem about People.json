    "The jaunty crop-haired graying",
    "Women in grocery stores,",
    "Their clothes boyish and neat,",
    "New mittens or clean sneakers,",
    "Clean hands, hips not bad still,",
    "Buying ice cream, steaks, soda,",
    "Fresh melons and soap\u2014or the big",
    "Balding young men in work shoes",
    "And green work pants, beer belly",
    "And white T-shirt, the porky walk",
    "Back to the truck, polite; possible",
    "To feel briefly like Jesus,",
    "A gust of diffuse tenderness",
    "Crossing the dark spaces",
    "To where the dry self burrows",
    "Or nests, something that stirs,",
    "Watching the kinds of people",
    "On the street for a while\u2014",
    "But how love falters and flags",
    "When anyone\u2019s difficult eyes come",
    "Into focus, terrible gaze of a unique",
    "Soul, its need unlovable: my friend",
    "In his divorced schoolteacher",
    "Apartment, his own unsuspected",
    "Paintings hung everywhere,",
    "Which his wife kept in a closet\u2014",
    "Not, he says, that she wasn\u2019t",
    "Perfectly right; or me, mis-hearing",
    "My rock radio sing my self-pity:",
    "\u201cThe Angels Wished Him Dead\u201d\u2014all",
    "The hideous, sudden stare of self,",
    "Soul showing through like the lizard",
    "Ancestry showing in the frontal gaze",
    "Of a robin busy on the lawn.",
    "In the movies, when the sensitive",
    "Young Jewish soldier nearly drowns",
    "Trying to rescue the thrashing",
    "Anti-semitic bully, swimming across",
    "The river raked by nazi fire,",
    "The awful part is the part truth:",
    "but me,",
    "Love me for myself. The weather",
    "Changes in the black of night,",
    "And the dream-wind, bowling across",
    "The sopping open spaces",
    "Of roads, golf courses, parking lots,",
    "Flails a commotion",
    "In the dripping treetops,",
    "Tries a half-rotten shingle",
    "Or a down-hung branch, and we",
    "All dream it, the dark wind crossing",
    "The wide spaces between us."

    "Felicity the healer isn\u2019t young",
    "And you don\u2019t look him up unless you need him.",
    "Clown\u2019s eyes, Pope\u2019s nose, a mouth for dirty stories,",
    "He made his bundle in the Great Depression",
    "And now, a jovial immigrant success",
    "In baggy pinstripes, he winks and wheezes gossip,",
    "Village stories that could lift your hair",
    "Or lance a boil; the small town dirt, the dope,",
    "The fishy deals and incestuous combinations,",
    "The husband and the wife of his wife\u2019s brother,",
    "The hospital contract, the certificate ...",
    "A realist and hardy omnivore,",
    "He strolls the jetties when the month is right",
    "With a knife and lemons in his pocket, after",
    "Live mussels from among the smelly rocks,",
    "Preventative of impotence and goitre.",
    "And as though the sight of tissue healing crooked",
    "Pleased him, like the ocean\u2019s vaginal taste,",
    "He\u2019ll stitch your thumb up so it shows for life.",
    "And where he once was the only quack in town",
    "We all have heard his half-lame joke, the one",
    "About the operation that succeeded,",
    "The tangy line that keeps that clever eye",
    "So merry in the punchinello face."

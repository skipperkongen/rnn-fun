    "And Summer turns her head with its dark tangle",
    "All the way toward us; and the trees are heavy,",
    "With little sprays of limp green maple and linden",
    "Adhering after a rainstorm to the sidewalk",
    "Where yellow pollen dries in pools and runnels.",
    "Along the oceanfront, pink neon at dusk:",
    "The long, late dusk, a light wind from the water",
    "Lifting a girl\u2019s hair forward against her cheek",
    "And swaying a chain of bulbs.",
    "In luminous booths,",
    "The bright, traditional wheel is on its ratchet,",
    "And ticking gaily at its little pawl;",
    "And the surf revolves; and passing cars and people,",
    "Their brilliant colors\u2014all strange and hopeful as Ralegh\u2019s",
    "Trophies: the balsam, the prizes of untried virtue,",
    "Bananas and armadillos that a Captain",
    "Carries his Monarch from another world."

    "And Change, with hurried hand, has swept these scenes:",
    "The woods have fallen; across the meadow-lot",
    "The hunter\u2019s trail and trap-path is forgot;",
    "And fire has drunk the swamps of evergreens!",
    "Yet for a moment let my fancy plant",
    "These autumn hills again,\u2014the wild dove\u2019s haunt,",
    "The wild deer\u2019s walk. In golden umbrage shut,",
    "The Indian river runs, Quonecktacut!",
    "Here, but a lifetime back, where falls to-night",
    "Behind the curtained pane a sheltered light",
    "On buds of rose, or vase of violet",
    "Aloft upon the marble mantel set,\u2014",
    "Here, in the forest-heart, hung blackening",
    "The wolf-bait on the bush beside the spring."

    "Yet, even \u2018mid merry boyhood\u2019s tricks and scapes,",
    "Early my heart a deeper lesson learnt;",
    "Wandering alone by many a mile burnt",
    "Black woodside, that but the snow-flake decks and drapes.",
    "And I have stood beneath Canadian sky,",
    "In utter solitudes, where the cricket\u2019s cry",
    "Appals the heart, and fear takes visible shapes;",
    "And on Long Island\u2019s void and isolate capes",
    "Heard the sea break like iron bars: and still,",
    "In all, I seemed to hear the same deep dirge;",
    "Borne in the wind, the insect\u2019s tiny trill,",
    "And crash and jangle of the shaking surge;",
    "And knew not what they meant,\u2014prohetic woe?",
    "Dim bodings, wherefore? Now, indeed, I know!"

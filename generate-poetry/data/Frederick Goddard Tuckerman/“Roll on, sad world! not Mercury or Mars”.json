    "Roll on, sad world! not Mercury or Mars",
    "Could swifter speed, or slower, round the sun,",
    "Than in this year of variance thou hast done",
    "For me. Yet pain, fear, heart-break, woes, and wars",
    "Have natural limit; from his dread eclipse",
    "The swift sun hastens, and the night debars",
    "The day, but to bring in the day more bright;",
    "The flowers renew their odorous fellowships;",
    "The moon runs round and round; the slow earth dips,",
    "True to her poise, and lifts; the planet-stars",
    "Roll and return from circle to ellipse;",
    "The day is dull and soft, the eave-trough drips;",
    "And yet I know the splendor of the light",
    "Will break anon: look! where the gray is white!"

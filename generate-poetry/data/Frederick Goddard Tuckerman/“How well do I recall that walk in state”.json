    "Across the Common, by the paths we knew:",
    "Myself in silver badge and riband blue,",
    "My little sister with her book and slate;",
    "The elm tree by the Pond, the fence of wood,",
    "The burial place that at the corner stood",
    "Where once we crossed, through the forbidden grate,",
    "The stones that grudg\u2019d us way, the graveside weed,",
    "The ominous wind that turned us half about.",
    "Smit the flying drops, at what a speed",
    "Across the paths, unblessed and unforgiven",
    "We hurried homeward when the day was late",
    "And heard, with awe that left no place for doubt,",
    "God\u2019s anger mutter in the darkened heaven."

    "We are space between\u2014",
    "the black-orange blur",
    "of a million Monarchs",
    "on their two-generation migration",
    "south to fir-crowned Michoac\u00e1n",
    "where tree trunks will sprout feathers,",
    "a forest of paper-thin wings.",

    "mariposas negras y anaranjadas",
    "in whose sweep the dead whisper.",
    "We are between\u2014",
    "the flicker of a chameleon\u2019s tail",
    "that turns his desert-blue backbone",
    "to jade or pink sand,",
    "the snake-skinned fraternal twins",
    "of solstice and equinox.",
    "The ashen dawn, silvering dusk,",
    "la oraci\u00f3n as it leaves the lips,",
    "the tug from sleep,",
    "the glide into dreams",
    "that husk out mestizo memory.",
    "We are\u2014",
    "one life passing through the prism",
    "of all others, gathering color and song,",
    "cempazuchil and drum",
    "to leave a rhythm scattered on the wind,",
    "dust tinting the tips of fingers",
    "as we slip into our new light."

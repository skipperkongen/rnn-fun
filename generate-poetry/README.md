# Character-level Language Model

Slight modification of code in the article [Text Generation With LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/).

Other material:

- [Character-Aware Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06615)
- [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

## Running the code

You need:

- Python 3
- Numpy
- Keras
- Jupyter


```
python agent.py predict -s "Hello world"
```
